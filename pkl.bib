  abstract  = {Objective: An increase in numbers of cases of sick leave due to stress have been reported from several European countries during recent decades. Chronic stress-induced exhaustion disorder is associated with physiological and neurobiological perturbations that may contribute to cognitive problems and long-term exhaustion. Rehabilitation of patients with 
chronic stress-induced exhaustion disorder is therefore challenging. This narrative review summarizes the evidence regarding the effectiveness of different interventions for the rehabilitation of patients with chronic stress-induced exhaustion disorder.

Methods: Both structured and unstructured searches of research studies and reports were performed in order to find knowledge sources. The structured search had 2 predefined inclusion criteria: (i) chronic 
stress-induced exhaustion/clinical burnout/severe burnout/stress-induced exhaustion; and (ii) rehabil-itation with improvement of symptoms and/or 
return to work as outcomes.

Results: Cognitive behavioural interventions and multimodal interventions seem to reduce symptoms. Workplace interventions, either work-focused cognitive behavioural or workplace dialogue, seem to improve return to work. Sleep is important for both symptom improvement and return to work, and interventions for improving sleep might therefore be important. For improvement of cognitive function, which is a main complaint among patients with chronic stress-induced exhaustion disorder, aerobic and cognitive training may have some effect.

Conclusion: In summary, the few studies of high-quality that examine
interventions for rehabilitation of chronic stress-induced exhaustion
disorder show only marginal effects. Thus, it is important to prevent
the onset of chronic stress-induced exhaustion disorder.},

  abstract = { Background:Recent US practice guidelines and laboratory regulations for quality control (QC) emphasize the development of QC plans and the application of risk management principles. The US Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) now includes an option to comply with QC regulations by developing an individualized QC plan (IQCP) based on a risk assessment of the total testing process. The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) has provided new practice guidelines for application of risk management to QC plans and statistical QC (SQC).Methods:We describe an alternative approach for developing a total QC plan (TQCP) that includes a risk-based SQC procedure. CLIA compliance is maintained by analyzing at least 2 levels of controls per day. A Sigma-Metric SQC Run Size nomogram provides a graphical tool to simplify the selection of risk-based SQC procedures.Applications:Current HbA1c method performance, as demonstrated by published method validation studies, is estimated to be 4-Sigma quality at best. Optimal SQC strategies require more QC than the CLIA minimum requirement of 2 levels per day. More complex control algorithms, more control measurements, and a bracketed mode of operation are needed to assure the intended quality of results.Conclusions:A total QC plan with a risk-based SQC procedure provides a simpler alternative to an individualized QC plan. A Sigma-Metric SQC Run Size nomogram provides a practical tool for selecting appropriate control rules, numbers of control measurements, and run size (or frequency of SQC). Applications demonstrate the need for continued improvement of analytical performance of HbA1c laboratory methods. },

In the world of metrology – the science of measurement and its application – there is a language which has to be learned. The International Vocabulary of Metrology (VIM) was produced to provide a common language, primarily for physical measurements. The third edition (International Vocabulary of Metrology – Basic and General Concepts and Associated Terms (VIM 3) was published in 2007. There are many differences between VIM 3 and earlier editions; one important change is captured in the title with the addition of the word ‘concepts’. The VIM 3 is a consistent set of concepts each described by a unique term, the ‘label’ of the concept. VIM 3 is applicable across all scientific disciplines thus making it relevant to those involved in performing measurements in chemistry and biology. Consistent definitions of concepts with their associated terms and symbols are essential if analysts and customers across the globe are to understand each other.

This Eurachem Guide discusses a selection of the concepts in VIM 3, focusing on those most likely to be encountered in analytical laboratories. It aims to cover chemical, biological and clinical measurements and gives examples over and above those in the notes accompanying the definitions in VIM 3. The guide is intended for laboratory staff, accreditation bodies, for those commissioning measurements and for those using measurement results. Lecturers and trainers may also find this guide useful when teaching aspects of metrology.

A computerized tomography (CT) scan is positive in up to 98\% of patients with SAH presenting within 12 h, but is positive in only 50\% of those presenting within one week. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) bilirubin spectrophotometry can be used to determine the need for angiography in those few CT-negative patients in whom clinical suspicion of SAH remains high; it may remain positive up to two weeks after the event. A lumbar puncture (LP) should only be performed >12 h after the onset of presenting symptoms. Whenever possible collect sequential specimens. Always ensure that the least blood-stained CSF sample taken (usually the last) is sent for bilirubin analysis. Protect the CSF from light and avoid vacuum tube transport systems, if possible. Always use spectrophotometry in preference to visual inspection. All CSF specimens are precious and should always be analysed unless insufficient sample is received. Centrifuge the specimen at >2000 rpm for 5 min as soon as possible after receipt in the laboratory. Store the supernatant at 4°C in the dark until analysis. An increase in CSF bilirubin is the key finding, which supports the occurrence of SAH but is not specific for this. In most positive cases, bilirubin will occur with oxyhaemoglobin. },

Although the traditional classification of the coagulation system into extrinsic and intrinsic pathway is still valid, the newer insights into coagulation provide more authentic description of the same. Normal coagulation pathway represents a balance between the pro coagulant pathway that is responsible for clot formation and the mechanisms that inhibit the same beyond the injury site. Imbalance of the coagulation system may occur in the perioperative period or during critical illness, which may be secondary to numerous factors leading to a tendency of either thrombosis or bleeding. A systematic search of literature on PubMed with MeSH terms 'coagulation system, haemostasis and anaesthesia revealed twenty eight related clinical trials and review articles in last 10 years. Since the balance of the coagulation system may tilt towards bleeding and thrombosis in many situations, it is mandatory for the clinicians to understand physiologic basis of haemostasis in order to diagnose and manage the abnormalities of the coagulation process and to interpret the diagnostic tests done for the same.},

  abstract  = {Night shift work is associated with adverse health effects, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie this association is instrumental in advancing the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of shift work-related health concerns. We characterized the effect on genome-wide gene expression levels of a 4-day protocol simulating night shifts in healthy human subjects under highly controlled laboratory conditions. We demonstrate that this night shift protocol leads to a dampening of gene expression rhythms and a desynchrony between rhythmic transcripts and the shifted sleep/wake cycle. Moreover, we uncovered key biological processes and regulatory molecules that are altered during this night shift protocol and that may contribute to the development of health problems on the long term.Misalignment of the endogenous circadian timing system leads to disruption of physiological rhythms and may contribute to the development of the deleterious health effects associated with night shift work. However, the molecular underpinnings remain to be elucidated. Here, we investigated the effect of a 4-day simulated night shift work protocol on the circadian regulation of the human transcriptome. Repeated blood samples were collected over two 24-hour measurement periods from eight healthy subjects under highly controlled laboratory conditions before and 4 days after a 10-hour delay of their habitual sleep period. RNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells to obtain transcriptomic data. Cosinor analysis revealed a marked reduction of significantly rhythmic transcripts in the night shift condition compared with baseline at group and individual levels. Subsequent analysis using a mixed-effects model selection approach indicated that this decrease is mainly due to dampened rhythms rather than to a complete loss of rhythmicity: 73\% of transcripts rhythmically expressed at baseline remained rhythmic during the night shift condition with a similar phase relative to habitual bedtimes, but with lower amplitudes. Functional analysis revealed that key biological processes are affected by the night shift protocol, most notably the natural killer cell-mediated immune response and Jun/AP1 and STAT pathways. These results show that 4 days of simulated night shifts leads to a loss in temporal coordination between the human circadian transcriptome and the external environment and impacts biological processes related to the adverse health effects associated to night shift work.},

  abstract  = {Nighttime napping is an effective measure to prevent adverse effects due to night shift work. A characteristic of nighttime nap is that it can result in considerably deeper sleep. Several studies have shown that taking nighttime naps suppressed increasing sleepiness, decreasing alertness during the period following awaking from a nap, and prevented disturbance of circadian rhythm (“anchor sleep”). The length of daytime sleep after night shift, when combined with a nighttime nap, is shorter than that without nap. This finding might be interpreted as a beneficial effect rather than a negative feature because workers can then spend time engaged in other activities rather than sleeping. Nevertheless, the introduction of nighttime sleep break in the workplace has not been widely accepted. To promote nighttime napping strategy in the workplace, consensus building while acting on conflicting interest is essential. Recently, participatory method for improvement of working condition has expanded worldwide. A characteristic of the activity is using action checklist and group work, and heightening motivation to improvement working condition between worker and manager. Through the activities, nighttime napping strategy would be spread more in the workplaces and play a role as one of the effective tools for improving working conditions, work performance and safety in the future.},

Sixty male students, classified as M-types or E-types by the Japanese version morningness-eveningness questionnaire, were recruited for this study. Five moderate M-types and eight moderate E-types were selected. Their MEQ scores were 32-41 (average 36.9) in E-types and 60-64 (average 62.4) in M-types, respectively. Experiment periods were simulated shift schedules of 9 consecutive days consisting of 2 d shifts (working 8:00-16:00), 3 night shifts (working 22:00-8:00) and 3 d shifts. They carried out two series of experiments. In one series the subjects took a nap from 2:00 to 4:00. In the other series they did not take a nap during the night shift. In order to minimize the effect of the previous experiments, a rest period of more than one week was inserted between the nap-condition and the no-nap condition experiments. During the shifts, the subjects repeatedly performed two kinds of tasks: typing figures listed randomly on sheets into a computer for 20 min; and after a 5 min break performing mental arithmetic with two adjacent figures, listed randomly on the sheets, for 15 min. During the breaks, psycho-physiological functions and questionnaires on subjective feelings of fatigue and index of the state of anxiety were examined. Throughout the experiments, heart rate variability was also recorded with a portable recorder to evaluate autonomic nerve activity. Task performances decreased and subjective feelings of fatigue and anxiety scores increased in proportion to the length of time worked in both M-types and E-types who had no nap. In M-types, these changes were significantly suppressed by the nap on the first night of duty. Parasympathetic nerve activity for M-types estimated from heart rate variability between 4:00 and 6:00 under nap conditions decreased significantly compared with that under no-nap conditions. Overall changes for E-types, however, were smaller than those for M-types in terms of task performance and psycho-physiological parameters. The present study suggested that taking a nighttime nap was an effective way to reduce adverse effects due to first nocturnal work, especially for M-types.},

Cited references were also used to identify the relevant literature. In this report, we review technical information related to detection methods of urine drug tests that are commonly used and provide an overview of false-positive/false-negative data for commonly misused substances in the following categories: cannabinoids, central nervous system (CNS) depressants, CNS stimulants, hallucinogens, designer drugs, and herbal drugs of abuse. We also present brief discussions of alcohol and tricyclic antidepressants as related to urine drug tests, for completeness. The goal of this review was to provide a useful tool for clinicians when interpreting urine drug test results and making appropriate clinical decisions on the basis of the information presented.},

  abstract  = { BackgroundThe dilution or adulteration of urine is a serious problem in drugs of abuse testing. Tests to identify adulteration are currently available. This study investigated the ability of the CEDIA® sample check to detect adulteration.MethodsEight different drugs of abuse were added to a urine sample obtained from a healthy, drug-free subject: 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP), 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, benzoylecgonine, D-amphetamine sulphate, ethyl-D-glucuronide, morphine sulphate, oxazepam, (-)-11-nor-9-carboxy-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol. Urine samples were diluted to yield three samples of drugs of abuse concentrations close to general cut-offs as used in methadone treatment centres, by health authorities for psychological tests and in traffic medicine. Aspirin, citric acid, CrO3, H2O2, soap, sodium metaborate, vitamin C were added in three, HCl and NaOH in one, and NaN3 in two concentrations. All samples were measured with commercially available immunological assays shortly after sample preparation and 24 h later. All samples were further analysed with the CEDIA® sample check reaction which may identify adulteration.ResultsOxidizing reagents (H2O2 or CrO3) are most effective in interfering in the measurement of benzoylecgonine, EDDP, ethyl-D-glucuronide and morphine sulphate. The measurement of (-)-11-nor-9-carboxy-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol is affected by many adulterants. Adulteration with HCl and NaOH was identified with the sample check reaction. NaN3 generated false negative results for a number of drugs of abuse.ConclusionsUrine samples with drugs of abuse concentrations above cut-offs can be successfully tampered with adulterants in a way which cannot be detected with the CEDIA® sample check assay. },

Sixty-five urine specimens (from 41 patients with overactive bladder and 24 controls) were examined using both the standard and EQUC culture techniques. Fifty-two of the 65 urine samples (80\%) grew bacterial species using EQUC, while the majority of these (48/52 [92\%]) were reported as no growth at 103 CFU/ml by the clinical microbiology laboratory using the standard urine culture protocol. Thirty-five different genera and 85 different species were identified by EQUC. The most prevalent genera isolated were Lactobacillus (15\%), followed by Corynebacterium (14.2\%), Streptococcus (11.9\%), Actinomyces (6.9\%), and Staphylococcus (6.9\%). Other genera commonly isolated include Aerococcus, Gardnerella, Bifidobacterium, and Actinobaculum.

The database covers 316 quantities and reviews 191 articles, fewer than 10 of which had to be rejected. The
within- and between-subject coefficients of variation and the subsequent desirable quality specifications for precision, bias and total error for all the quantities accepted are presented. Sex-related stratification of results was justified for only four quantities and, in these cases, quality specifications were derived from the group with lower within-subject variation. For certain quantities, biological variation in pathological states was higher than in the healthy state. In these cases, quality specifications were derived only from the healthy population (most stringent). Several quantities (particularly hormones) have been treated in very few articles and the results found are highly discrepant. Therefore, professionals in laboratory medicine should be strongly encouraged to study the quantities for which results are discrepant, the 90 quantities described in only one paper and the numerous quantities that have not been the subject of study. },

In part, this is aspiration to preserve the format of a paper report in electronic format. It is also due to the limitations of electronic media to display the data. The advancement of web-based technologies and functionality of hand-held devices together with wireless and other technologies afford the opportunity to rethink data presentation with the aim of emphasising the message in the data, thereby modifying clinical behaviours and potentially reducing post-analytical error. This article takes the form of a commentary which explores new developments in the field of infographics and, together with examples, suggests some new approaches to communicating what is currently just data into information. The combination of graphics and a new approach to provocative interpretative commenting offers a powerful tool in improving pathology utilisation. An additional challenge is the requirement to consider how pathology reports may be issued directly to patients.},

  abstract  = {Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are increasingly popular in the social sciences, not only in medicine. We argue that the lay public, and sometimes researchers, put too much trust in RCTs over other methods of investigation. Contrary to frequent claims in the applied literature, randomization does not equalize everything other than the treatment in the treatment and control groups, it does not automatically deliver a precise estimate of the average treatment effect (ATE), and it does not relieve us of the need to think about (observed or unobserved) covariates. Finding out whether an estimate was generated by chance is more difficult than commonly believed. At best, an RCT yields an unbiased estimate, but this property is of limited practical value. Even then, estimates apply only to the sample selected for the trial, often no more than a convenience sample, and justification is required to extend the results to other groups, including any population to which the trial sample belongs, or to any individual, including an individual in the trial. Demanding ‘external validity’ is unhelpful because it expects too much of an RCT while undervaluing its potential contribution. RCTs do indeed require minimal assumptions and can operate with little prior knowledge. This is an advantage when persuading distrustful audiences, but it is a disadvantage for cumulative scientific progress, where prior knowledge should be built upon, not discarded. RCTs can play a role in building scientific knowledge and useful predictions but they can only do so as part of a cumulative program, combining with other methods, including conceptual and theoretical development, to discover not ‘what works’, but ‘why things work’.},

  abstract  = {We suggest here a pragmatic approach for managing results of clinical chemistry testing in hemolyzed samples collected from adults/older children, attempting to balance the need to produce quality laboratory data with clinical urgency of releasing test results. Automatic measurement of the hemolysis index (H-index) in serum or plasma is highly advisable, whilst low-quality assessment of this test remains less good than a visual inspection. Regarding its practical use, when the H-index value does not generate an analytically significant bias, results can be released, whilst when the value is associated with analyte variation in a range between analytically and clinically significant bias (i.e. variation does not exceed the reference change value [RCV]), results of hemolysis-sensitive tests can be released in association with a comment describing the direction in which data are potentially altered, suggesting the need to collect another sample. When the H-index is associated with analyte variation exceeding clinically significant bias (i.e. variation exceeds the RCV), results of hemolysis-sensitive tests should be suppressed and replaced with a comment that biased results cannot be released because the sample is preanalytically compromised and advising the recollection of another sample. If H-index values reach an even higher critical cut-off (i.e. H-index corresponding to a cell-free hemoglobin concentration ≥10 g/L), all laboratory data may be unreliable and should hence be suppressed and replaced with a comment that all data cannot be released because the sample is grossly hemolyzed, also suggesting the recollection of another sample. Due to inaccuracy and imprecision, the use of corrective formulas for adjusting data of hemolysis-sensitive tests is discouraged.

European Journal of Medical Sciences E ur J Med Sci. 2014 Jun ; 1( 2 ): 43 - 5244IntroductionIntroductionIntroductionIntroductionLaboratory data can be affected by manyvariables. A number of diseases result inincreased amounts of chromogens such asbilirubin or hemoglobin, or lipemic particles,which increase the turbidity. These chromogensinterfere with many photometric assays.However, this interference can be quantified bymeans of serum index measurements. Wheninformation related to analytical interferences isnot reported with patient test results, cliniciansmay interpret test results incorrectly and makeunsuitable procedure related to patients.Interference affecting the test results should beunderstood well to give proper clinicaldecisions. When interferences affecting theblood or other samples are properly determinedand standardized, clinical decisions dependingon laboratory test results can be given moreaccurately (1,2). While analytical standards arebeing developed by quality assessment criteria,there are shortcomings in the development ofstandards related to the preanalytical phase.Recently, some recommendations related todefinition of the optimal sample volume, use ofanticoagulant and stabilizer, sample collection,transport and storage, icteric, lipemic, andhemolyzed samples prevention have beenpublished (3). Total laboratory process consistsof preanalytical, analytical and postanalyticalphases. Preanalytic phase is one of the mostimportant components of the medicallaboratory. Quality control studies should bemade for all analytical phases to provide theprecision and accuracy of laboratory test results.Despite the technological advances inlaboratory automation devices anddevelopments in quality control programs,laboratory errors still occur. Prenalytical phaseis the process in which the vast majority oflaboratory errors happen (3,4). Plebani et alreported that the manuscript distribution oflaboratory errors is as such: 68.2% inpreanalytical, 13.3% in analytical and 18.5% inpostanalytical phase. Preanalytical phaseincludes all of the various procedures beforemeasurement of a sample. Preanalytical factorsinclude patient related variables (age, sex, diet,stress, medication … ), sample collection (bloodcollection technique, sample volume,anticoagulant type … ), sample transport andsample preparation procedures. Before analysis,detection of inappropriate sample plays animportant role in the prevention of errorsbecause laboratory errors usually emerge inpreanalytical phase and they can lead to further,inappropriate investigation and treatments. Inaddition, the samples which are rejected due toanalytical interferences will lead to loss of time,labour and supplies, leading to increases in cost(3,5).Up to now, medical laboratories have taken a“ judgment inspection ” approach to endogenousinterferences; the operator decides whether thesample is appropriate or inappropriate. If anabnormal result is obtained, the sample isinspected for visible interferences. Thus,judgment inspections can only detect errorsafter they have been made and identified.Manuel inspection may be performed on everysample before analysis or inspecting samplesthat produce “ suspect ” results. This is very timeconsuming. In addition a normal result does notcreate suspicion. When serum indices areproduced by the instrument, consistentevaluations are made and remove the potentialfor human error and save operator time. Thecosts involved in repeating “ out of limit ” resultsdue to interferences are reduced. The serumindex result reported with the test resultsenables the operate to acknowledge thepresence of interfering substances as thepotential cause of the abnormal result andremoves need to rerun the sample, thusreducing costs. Glick interferographs areproduced for all assays. This is an easilyunderstandable graphical display of theinterference data showing the deviation fromthe original result caused by the interferent. Thelevel of interference producing a clinicallysignificant difference is indicated in Rochepack insert (6-8). In this study, we aimed toevaluate the effectiveness of current serumindices implementations with existingautomated systems for detection ofinterferences which are unrecognized visuallyand to assess their positive and practicaladvantages for routine laboratory processes.

The study wascarried out in accordance with Declaration ofHelsinki.SampleSampleSampleSample CollectionCollectionCollectionCollection andandandand Preparation:Preparation:Preparation:Preparation:Patient samples which were received at thelaboratory for routine analysis were used in thisstudy. Fasting venous blood samples werecollected by using Vacuette ® Standard tubeholder and Vacuette ® 21-gauge, 0.80 × 38 mmmultisample needle (Vacuette ® , Greiner Bio-One, Kremsmunster, Austria) in the morningduring a week. Blood samples were drawn into8 mL serum gel seperator tubes(Vacuette ® Tube Serum Gel Separator ClotActivator 8 mL, Greiner Bio-One,Kremsmunster, Austria)(Ref.No.455071,Lot.No.A120600Y). Blood samples werecentrifuged at 3000 g for ten minutes. Aftercentrifugation, serum samples were inspectedvisually by laboratory technicians during aweek. Visual examination was done by twolaboratory technicians who were informedabout the study. Visual examination wasperformed according to our standardizedcolored photos and they made a consensusabout the doubtful samples according to thisphotos. Consequently, 717 patient sampleswhich were decided visually to not to includeany interferences were reserved for study.These samples freshly analyzed without delay.MeasurementMeasurementMeasurementMeasurement ofofofof TestTestTestTest Parameters:Parameters:Parameters:Parameters:Twenty three different test parameters thatknown to be most affected by interferenceswere analysed. All of the tests were analysed onRoche Cobas 6000 autoanalyzer (RocheDiagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) with theoriginal reagents (Roche Diagnostics GmbH D-68298 Mannheim, Germany). Analysed testparameters and methods of analyses are shownin table 1. While these parameters were beinganalyzed, serum indices were also examined atthe same time.DescriptionDescriptionDescriptionDescription ofofofof RocheRocheRocheRoche SerumSerumSerumSerum IndeIndeIndeInde xxxxProgramme:Programme:Programme:Programme:Serum indices are calculations of absorbancemeasurements that provide semiquantitativerepresentation of icterus, hemolysis or lipemia(turbidity) levels present in patient samples. Forthis purpose, Roche Serum Index Gen2 (SI2)application program was used. This programworks based on test parameters and gives indexresults for each test parameters. Workingprinciple of Roche serum indices application isas follows: For measuring serum indices, theanalyzer takes an aliquot of the patien sample,dilutes it with 0.9% NaCl and then measuresthe absorbances at three pairs of wavelengths.For measurement of lipemia, wavelengths of700/660 nm are used because this range is freefrom influence by hemolysis and icterus.Hemolysis is measured at 600/570 nm. Icterusis measured at 505/480 nm. To obtain theserum indexes L, H, and I from the sample ’ sabsorbances, the system uses the certainformulas. After serum indices are measured,autoanalyzer compares them with the hemolysis(H), icterus (I) and lipemia (L) limits given ineach individual test application. Once the serumindexes are determined, refer to theapplication ’ s package insert to assess the results.This indicates the index up to which potentialinterference is within the Roche Diagnosticsspecification or when the hemolysed, icteric, orlipemic sample may not be used with therespective application. Potential interferencebelow these limits is considered clinicallyirrelevant. Upper limits for serum indexes canbe defined individually for each test. Limitvalues are loaded with the application. Ifmeasured values are higher than specifiedlimits of the individual tests, the analyzer issuesalarms for the measured results. For example;the application albumin is programmed with aL index limit of 200 and if the obtained L indexis greater than 200, a serum alarm is issued.Therefore a serum data alarm is attached to theresult. If an index value is higher than a
European Journal of Medical Sciences E ur J Med Sci. 2014 Jun ; 1( 2 ): 43 - 5246parametre ’ s limit, an index warning “ > ” is putnext to that parameter. Each report contains anote indicating the appearance of the sample.Serum indices are represented as I.H. forhemolysis, I.L. for lipemia and I.I. for icterus.The hemolysis index, I.H, is reported inhemolysis units that are linear, up to1000mg/dL, and semi-quantitative. For example, ahemolysis index of 500 is equivalent to aknown hemoglobin concentration ofapproximately 500 mg/dL. The lipemia index,I.L, is reported in lipemia units correspondingto mg/dL of Intralipid ® (Kabi-Pharmacia, Inc.),an artificial lipid material. These units arelinear, up to 2000 mg/dL, and semi-quantitative.For example, an L index of 1000 is equivalentto a 1000 mg/dL Intralipid solution. Hence, theL index provides an estimate of sample ’ sturbidity, not its concentration of triglycerides.The icterus index, I.I, is reported in icterus unitsthat are linear, up to 60 mg/dL, and semi-quantitative. For example, an icterus index of20 is equivalent to a known unconjugatedbilirubin concentration of approximately 20mg/dL. List of interferences based on serumindices are shown in table 1. Roche conductsthe interference studies according to guidelinesof The National Committee for ClinicalLaboratory Standarts (NCCLS) (6).RRRR esultsesultsesultsesultsIn present study, while interferences weredetected in 108 of 717 patient samples by usingRoche Serum Index Gen2 (SI2), remaining 609samples did not have any nfluence and werenormal. Hemolysis was detected in 102 samples,lipemia was detected in four samples andicterus was detected in only two samples. Thepercentages of interferences in all samples wereshown in figure 1. Percentage distribution ofhemolysis was 14.22% in total patient samplesand 94.44% in interfered samples. Percentagedistribution of lipemia was 0.55% in totalpatient samples and 3.70% in interferedsamples. Percentage distribution of icterus was0.27% in total patient samples and 1.85% ininterfered samples. The percentages ofinterferences in samples that detectedinterferences were shown in figure 2. Whilesome of the tests that we analysed wereaffected by interference, some tests were not.Tests which were affected by hemolysis werecreatine-kinase MB (CK-MB), lactatedehydrogenase (LDH), aspartat aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (T.BIL), directbilirubin (D.BIL), and unsaturated iron bindingcapacity (UIBC). In the other parameters, theinterference due to hemolysis was not observedbecause, measured values of this parameterswere not higher than specified limits of them.In interfered samples, percentage distributionsof the affected tests by hemolysis interferenceswere shown in figure 3. Hemolysis index (I.H.)values of affected samples by hemolysis werelowest 11 and highest 181 and these valueswere presented in test result reports as warningin test results. When all of the samples affectedby hemolysis were evaluated in terms of I.H.value, number and type of affected testparameters were seen to differentiate dependingon the I.H. value.

In these samples, we observedthat only direct bilirubine was affected bylipemia while there were no effects on the othertests. Values of direct bilirubin affected bylipemia were within normal reference ranges inthe four samples. Lipemia index (I.L.) valueswere lowest 38 and highest 55. Icterinterferences were observed only two samples.In one of the samples, affected test parameterswere cholesterol, CK-MB, creatinine, GGT,total protein and triglyceride, and icter index(I.I.) value was 22.While total protein and creatinine were belownormal reference ranges, the others were abovenormal reference ranges. In the other sample,affected tests were creatinine and triglycerideand I.I. value was 12. Creatinine was belownormal reference ranges while triglyceride waswithin normal reference ranges. Because thenumber of samples in which lipemia and icterinterferences were observed was few,percentage distribution calculations could notbe done.DiscussionDiscussionDiscussionDiscussionKroll and Elin described interference as “ theeffect of a substance present in the samplethat alters the correct value of the result ” (9).Four major endogenous components thatoften affect many laboratory test results arehemoglobin, bilirubin, lipids and paraproteins.In routine laboratory diagnoses, the most
European Journal of Medical Sciences E ur J Med Sci. 2014 Jun ; 1( 2 ): 43 - 5250crucial cause of preanalytical errors ishemolysis. In our study, the most cause ofinterference was found as hemolysis (94.44%).According to data reported by clinicallaboratories, hemolysis is responsible for 40-70% of unsuitable and rejected samples. It isseen five times more than the other causes ofunsuitable samples such as inadequate sample,clotted sample and faulty sample etc. (10,11).Classically, hemolysis is release ofhemoglobin and the other intracellularcomponents to extracellular area followingcell membrane damage. Visible hemolysis isnot recognized until serum or plasma isseparated. When hemoglobin concentrationexceeds 0.3 g/L, hemolysis is recognizedvisually and it gives rise to red colored serumor plasma. Hemolysis can occur in vivo or invitro and it is an undesirable situation,because, it affects accuracy and reliability oflaboratory tests (11,12). Recent studies havereported that hemolysis affects manylaboratory tests such as potassium, sodium,calcium, magnesium, bilirubin, haptoglobin,total protein, ü ric acid, aldolaz, amylase, LDH,AST, ALT, phosphorus, ALP, acidphosphatase, GGT, folate and iron etc. (13-15). In our study, only 6 of 23 studiedparameters were affected from hemolysis.These parameters were CK-MB, LDH, AST,total bilirubin, direct bilirubin and unsaturatediron binding capacity; other parameters weren ’ taffected by hemolysis. Parameters which weremost affected by hemolysis were respectivelyCK-MB, LDH, direct bilirubin, AST,unsaturated iron binding capacity and totalbilirubin. In an article by K ö seo ğ lu et al. İ t wasreported that the most affected parameters fromhemolysis were AST, ALT, bilirubin andpotassium and these parameters were affectedby hemolysis even in very low hemoglobinconcentration (0.5 g/L). Lippi et al. reportedthat they observed clinically significantvariations of AST, LDH, chloride, potassium,sodium values due to hemolysis which was notrecognized visually (0.6 g/L) (16,17). In ourstudy, we observed that the number and type ofaffected test parameters varied according to I.H.value (I.H. value is proportional to thehemoglobin concentration in patient ’ s sera, forexample; if I.H. value is 500, hemoglobinconcentration is 500 mg/dL). According to ourresults, we observed that CK-MB and directbilirubin were affected by hemolysis even inthe lowest I.H. values (I.H. 11-16). AlthoughCK-MB was affected by hemolysis even invery low hemoglobin concentrations, it wasamazing that CK results of samples with thehighest I.H. values (I.H. 181) were not affectedby hemolysis. Adenylate kinase which isreleased to extracellular area from intracellulararea due to erythrocyte membrane damagecauses a rise of CK and CK-MB levels throughanalytical interference. In order to minimizethis interaction, adenylate kinase inhibitorssuch as adenosine monophosphate anddiadenosine pentaphosphate are added intoreactive mixture. For this purpose, Roche firmadds adenosine monophosphate anddiadenosine pentaphosphate to their CK andCK-MB reactives. This implementation causes97% inhibition for adenylate kinase activity andresidual small amount of adenylate kinaseactivity does not affect total CK activity butvery small amount of adenylate kinase activitycan affect to CK-MB measurement. Thisinformation in prospectus of manufacturer wasquite compatible with our results (18). Weobserved that LDH measurements wereaffected by I.H. from 26, AST and UIBCmeasurements were affected by I.H. from 41and total bilirubin measurements were affectedby I.H from 52. In the literature, informationabout the effect of hemolysis on tests is similar;however, there are different assessments aboutthe interference degree of analysis byhemoglobin concentrations. Yi ğ itba şı et al.reported that the effect of interference causedby hemolysis increased parallel to the degree ofhemolysis and added that test results weregradually higher or lower. They reported thatparticularly, AST, ALT, direct bilirubin,sodium and potassium tests were affected evenby very low hemoglobin concentrations. Y ü celat al. reported that acid phosphatase, potassiumand LDH were significantly affected byhemolysis. Ji at al. also evaluated seruminterferences on Roche Cobas 6000 system.Intheir study, the lowest I.H. value was 40 andthe affected parameters were AST, LDH, direct
European Journal of Medical Sciences E ur J Med Sci. 2014 Jun ; 1( 2 ): 43 - 5251bilirubin and UIBC; their results werecompatible with our results (19-21).In our study, the number of samples affectedby lipemia was 4 and the number of samplesaffected by icterus was only 2. Only directbilirubin was affected from lipemia whilecholesterol, CK-MB, creatinine, GGT, totalprotein and triglyceride were affected fromicterus. Whereas total protein and creatininewere negatively affected, the others werepositively affected. The most common causesof lipemia are diet, alcohol intake, DM,hypertriglyceridemia, chronic renal failure,hypothyroidism, pancreatite, multiplemyeloma, primary biliary cirrosis, lupuserithomatasus, estrogen intake. Lipemiainterference occurs due to 3 differentmechanisms: light scattering, increasednonaqueous phase, partition effect betweenpolar and nonpolar phases. Increased bilirubinconcentration causes chemical and spectralinterferences (22, 23).As a result, in order to prevent reporting oferroneous results, each sample should beevaluated against interference probability sothat interference errors could be decreasedand thus quality and patient safety could beimproved. Hinckley et al. reported that visualevaluation was unsuccessful in erroneoussample detection (24). Glick et al. found thatvisual evaluation of hemolysis, lipemia,icterus were very little compatible with realconcentration of interferent (25). Simundic etal. compared visual evaluation withautomated spectrophotometric evaluation.They reported that visual evaluation was notreliable and suggested that automated systemswhich report serum indices should replacevisual evaluation (26).Use of serum indices should be expanded sothat hemolysis and the other interferents aredetected more reliably and faster, possibility oferror is reduced, quality of laboratory diagnosisis increased, economical advantage is providedand patient security is not endangered. Serumindices can be seen as a fast and cheap way tofacilitate and accelerate the laboratoryprocesses for detection of icteric, lipemic andhemolytic samples. Quality of reported resultsis increased by serum indices because 100% ofsamples are controlled. As a result, serumindices will provide a reliable basis fordetection of error due to interferent and thus forrejection of sample (27,28).CCCC onclusiononclusiononclusiononclusionThe samples received by the laboratory may besignificantly influenced by interferences. Thechance of identifying a possible visibleinterferent is greatly decreased when primarytubes are covered with several labels whichprevent the clear inspection of the sample. Aserum index result generated with the sampleresult ensures that all samples are correctlyidentified. Particularly, results of serum indiceson the basis of parameters are much useful formonitoring of degree of interference. Afteranalysis, while test results are obtained, at thesame time, quality of samples is alsoautomatically monitored. The improved clinicalusefulness of the results allows better clinicaldecisions and better patient care.RRRR eferenceseferenceseferenceseferences1. Fraser CG.

  abstract  = { Clinical laboratories frequently encounter samples showing significant haemolysis, icterus or lipaemia. Technical advances, utilizing spectrophotometric measurements on automated chemistry analysers, allow rapid and accurate identification of such samples. However, accurate quantification of haemolysis, icterus and lipaemia interference is of limited value if laboratories do not set rational alert limits, based on sound interference testing experiments. Furthermore, in the context of increasing consolidation of laboratories and the formation of laboratory networks, there is an increasing requirement for harmonization of the handling of haemolysis, icterus and lipaemia-affected samples across different analytical platforms. Harmonization may be best achieved by considering both the analytical aspects of index measurement and the possible variations in the effects of haemolysis, icterus and lipaemia interferences on assays from different manufacturers. Initial verification studies, followed up with ongoing quality control testing, can help a laboratory ensure the accuracy of haemolysis, icterus and lipaemia index results, as well as assist in managing any biases in index results from analysers from different manufacturers. Similarities, and variations, in the effect of haemolysis, icterus and lipaemia interference in assays from different manufacturers can often be predicted from the mechanism of interference. Nevertheless, interference testing is required to confirm expected similarities or to quantify differences. It is important that laboratories are familiar with a number of interference testing protocols and the particular strengths and weaknesses of each. A rigorous approach to all aspects of haemolysis, icterus and lipaemia interference testing allows the analytical progress in index measurement to be translated into improved patient care. },

  abstract  = { In this article, we accomplish two things. First, we show that despite empirical psychologists’ nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (≤ .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process. },

A tool for this is the participation in external quality assessment (EQA) for all laboratories performing the HbA1c-test. An additional possibility to detect changes in trueness is to monitor variations in patient cohort mean or median values that is not explained by changes in treatment or selection of patients.Methods:Results reported to an EQA scheme for HbA1c during 20 years have been extracted from Equalis database. The results are compared to current analytical performance specifications (APS) and to the mean HbA1c levels for the Swedish population of persons with type 2 diabetes.Results:The accuracy of the HbA1c test has improved during the period. The hospital lab methods used in Sweden now fulfil APS agreed by professional organizations in Sweden. The accuracy for point-of-care tests (POCT) methods vary over time and fulfil APS for some periods. The bias found for some of the methods might explain changes seen in patient mean values for HbA1c in Sweden during the period 2007-2017.Conclusions:The global standardization of HbA1c has resulted in an improved comparability for HbA1c-results worldwide. But even small variation in trueness for the methods in use might have important impact on mean HbA1c values for cohorts of patients. When a systematic error is observed for a specific method it is therefore essential that manufacturers correct the method without delay. },

  abstract  = {Effective management of clinical laboratories participating in external quality assessment schemes (EQAS) is of fundamental importance in ensuring reliable analytical results. The International Standard ISO 15189:2012 requires participation in interlaboratory comparison [e.g. external quality assessment (EQA)] for all tests provided by an individual laboratory. If EQAS is not commercially available, alternative approaches should be identified, although clinical laboratories may find it challenging to choose the EQAS that comply with the international standards and approved guidelines. Great competence is therefore required, as well as knowledge of the characteristics and key elements affecting the reliability of an EQAS, and the analytical quality specifications stated in approved documents. Another skill of fundamental importance is the ability to identify an alternative approach when the available EQAS are inadequate or missing. Yet the choice of the right EQA program alone does not guarantee its effectiveness. In fact, the fundamental steps of analysis of the information provided in EQA reports and the ability to identify improvement actions to be undertaken call for the involvement of all laboratory staff playing a role in the specific activity. The aim of this paper was to describe the critical aspects that EQA providers and laboratory professionals should control in order to guarantee effective EQAS management and compliance with ISO 15189 accreditation requirements.

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: Recurrent pregnancy loss, (RPL) affecting 1\%{\textendash}2\% of couples, is defined as >=3 consecutive pregnancy losses before 20-week{\textquoteright} gestation. Women with RPL are routinely screened for etiological factors, but routine screening of male partners is not currently recommended. Recently it has been suggested that sperm quality is reduced in male partners of women with RPL, but the reasons underlying this lower quality are unclear. We hypothesized that these men may have underlying impairments of reproductive endocrine and metabolic function that cause reductions in sperm quality.METHODS: After ethical approval, reproductive parameters were compared between healthy controls and male partners of women with RPL. Semen reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured with a validated inhouse chemiluminescent assay. DNA fragmentation was measured with the validated Halosperm method.RESULTS: Total sperm motility, progressive sperm motility, and normal morphology were all reduced in the RPL group vs controls. Mean {\textpm}SE morning serum testosterone (nmol/L) was 15\% lower in RPL than in controls (controls, 19.0 {\textpm} 1.0; RPL, 16.0 {\textpm} 0.8; P \&lt; 0.05). Mean {\textpm}SE serum estradiol (pmol/L) was 16\% lower in RPL than in controls (controls, 103.1 {\textpm} 5.7; RPL, 86.5 {\textpm} 3.4; P \&lt; 0.01). Serum luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone were similar between groups. Mean {\textpm}SE ROS (RLU/sec/106 sperm) were 4-fold higher in RPL than in controls (controls, 2.0 {\textpm} 0.6; RPL, 9.1 {\textpm} 4.1; P \&lt; 0.01). Mean {\textpm}SE sperm DNA fragmentation (\%) was 2-fold higher in RPL than in controls (controls, 7.3 {\textpm} 1.0; RPL, 16.4 {\textpm} 1.5; P \&lt; 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that male partners of women with RPL have impaired reproductive endocrine function, increased levels of semen ROS, and sperm DNA fragmentation. Routine reproductive assessment of the male partners may be beneficial in RPL.},

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of consump-tion of standard eggs and ω-3 enriched eggs on lipoproteins, glucose and inflammation markers. Nineteen healthy volunteers consumed one extra egg per day of either standard eggs or ω-3 enriched eggs in a double-blind, cross-over study. The duration of each period was 1 month. The effects of the different egg diets on apolipoprotein A1 and B (Apo A1 and B), lipoprotein (a), creatinine, cystatin C, C-reactive protein, serum amyloid protein A, interleukin 6, triglycerides, glucose, total-, high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipo-protein cholesterol concentrations were analyzed. Addition of one regular egg per day to the normal diet had no negative impact on blood lipids or inflammation markers. Con-sumption of ω-3 enriched eggs resulted in higher levels of ApoA1, lower ApoB/ApoA1 ratio and lower plasma glucose. These effects have been associated in previous studies with a reduced risk for cardiovascular mortality and diabetes. },

Self-reported diet data were harmonized using a standardized protocol.Dietary cholesterol (mg/day) or egg consumption (number/day).Hazard ratio (HR) and absolute risk difference (ARD) over the entire follow-up for incident CVD (composite of fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, and other CVD deaths) and all-cause mortality, adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral factors.This analysis included 29 615 participants (mean [SD] age, 51.6 [13.5] years at baseline) of whom 13 299 (44.9\\%) were men and 9204 (31.1\\%) were black. During a median follow-up of 17.5 years (interquartile range, 13.0-21.7; maximum, 31.3), there were 5400 incident CVD events and 6132 all-cause deaths. The associations of dietary cholesterol or egg consumption with incident CVD and all-cause mortality were monotonic (all P values for nonlinear terms, .19-.83). Each additional 300 mg of dietary cholesterol consumed per day was significantly associated with higher risk of incident CVD (adjusted HR, 1.17 [95\\% CI, 1.09-1.26]; adjusted ARD, 3.24\\% [95\\% CI, 1.39\\%-5.08\\%]) and all-cause mortality (adjusted HR, 1.18 [95\\% CI, 1.10-1.26]; adjusted ARD, 4.43\\% [95\\% CI, 2.51\\%-6.36\\%]).

  abstract  = {Background: Ingestion of ethylene glycol is a relatively rare event but one with potentially lethal consequences. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are essential. However, diagnosis of poisoning can only be confirmed definitively by the measurement of ethylene glycol and/or its metabolites, usually performed by gas chromatographic methods. These methods are complex, requiring specialized equipment and expertise, and are often not available on an emergency basis. Methods: A quick, simple, and inexpensive enzymatic assay has been developed to detect glycolic acid, the major metabolite of ethylene glycol and the main cause of the resulting metabolic acidosis. In this assay, glycolic acid is converted to glyoxylic acid by glycolate oxidase, with the production of hydrogen peroxide, which is converted to a quinoneimine dye for spectrophotometric detection. Results: The assay has a functional sensitivity of 26 mg/L and coefficients of variation less than 13% (interassay) and less than 10% (intra-assay). No significant interference was observed for a range of compounds, and a comparison with a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method gave clinical sensitivity of 86% and clinical specificity of 92%. Stability of enzyme solutions was increased by the use of an alternative buffer, in which greater than 90% of the original activity was retained after storage at −20°C. Conclusions: As ethylene glycol poisoning is a medical emergency, there is a need for a screening test to minimize delays in diagnosis. The assay we describe is a simple and effective way to detect ethylene glycol poisoning, enabling earlier initiation of appropriate therapy and improving patient outcomes.},

Final diagnoses were centrally adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists with all clinical information including cardiac imaging twice: first, using serial hs-cTnT (Elecsys, primary analysis), and second, using hs-cTnI (Architect, secondary analysis) measurements in addition to the clinically used hs-cTn. hs-cTnI Access was measured at presentation and at 1 h. The primary objective was a direct comparison of diagnostic accuracy as quantified by the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of hs-cTnI Access vs the hs-cTnT Elecsys and hs-cTnI Architect assays. Secondary objectives included the derivation and validation of an hs-cTnI Access-specific 0/1-h algorithm.Results: AMI was the adjudicated final diagnosis in 243 of 1579 (15.4\%) patients. The AUC at presentation for hs-cTnI Access was 0.95 (95\% CI, 0.94{\textendash}0.96), higher than hs-cTnI Architect [0.92 (95\% CI, 0.91{\textendash}0.94; P \&lt; 0.001)] and comparable to hs-cTnT Elecsys [0.94 (95\% CI, 0.93{\textendash}0.95; P = 0.12)]. Applying the derived hs-cTnI Access 0/1-h algorithm (derivation cohort n = 686) to the validation cohort (n = 680), 60\% of patients were ruled out [sensitivity, 98.9\% (95\% CI, 94.3{\textendash}99.8)], and 15\% of patients were ruled in [specificity, 95.9\% (95\% CI, 94.0{\textendash}97.2)]. Patients ruled out by the 0/1-h algorithm had a survival rate of 100\% at 30 days. Findings were confirmed in the secondary analyses by the adjudication including serial measurements of Architect hs-cTnI.Conclusions: Diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of the Beckman hs-cTnI Access assay are very high and at least comparable to Roche hs-cTnT and Abbott hs-cTnI assays.

  abstract  = { Cardiac troponin I and cardiac troponin T are nowadays the criterion biomarkers for the laboratory diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction due to their very high sensitivities and specificities for myocardial injury. However, still many aspects of their degradation, tissue release and elimination from the human circulation are incompletely understood. Myocardial injury may be caused by a variety of different mechanisms, for example, myocardial ischaemia, inflammatory and immunological processes, trauma, drugs and toxins, and myocardial necrosis is preceded by a substantial reversible prelethal phase. Recent experimental data in a pig model of myocardial ischaemia demonstrated cardiac troponin release into the circulation from apoptotic cardiomyocytes as an alternative explanation for clinical situations with increased cardiac troponin without any other evidence for myocardial necrosis. However, the comparably lower sensitivities of all currently available imaging modalities, including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging for the detection of particularly non-focal myocardial necrosis in patients, has to be considered for cardiac troponin test result interpretation in clinical settings without any other evidence for myocardial necrosis apart from increased cardiac troponin concentrations as well. },

This study reviews the available clinical and empirical data. A systematic search of the literature was conducted using the following databases: PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO and Scopus; utilizing different combinations of the following search terms: autism, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Asperger’s disorder (AD), co-morbidity, gender dysphoria (GD), gender identity disorder (GID), transgenderism and transsexualism. In total, 25 articles and reports were selected and discussed. Information was grouped by found co-occurrence rates, underlying hypotheses and implications for diagnosis and treatment. GD and ASD were found to co-occur frequently – sometimes characterized by atypical presentation of GD, which makes a correct diagnosis and determination of treatment options for GD difficult. Despite these challenges there are several case reports describing gender affirming treatment of co-occurring GD in adolescents and adults with ASD. Various underlying hypotheses for the link between GD and ASD were suggested, but almost all of them lack evidence. },

The clinical assessment and treatment of adolescents with this co-occurrence is often complex, related to the developmental aspects of ASD. There are no guidelines for clinical care when ASD and GD co-occur; however, there are clinicians and researchers experienced in this co-occurrence. This study develops initial clinical consensus guidelines for the assessment and care of adolescents with co-occurring ASD and GD, from the best clinical practices of current experts in the field. Expert participants were identified through a comprehensive international search process and invited to participate in a two-stage Delphi procedure to form clinical consensus statements. The Delphi Method is a well-studied research methodology for obtaining consensus among experts to define appropriate clinical care. Of 30 potential experts identified, 22 met criteria as expert in co-occurring ASD and GD youth and participated. Textual data divided into the following data nodes: guidelines for assessment; guidelines for treatment; six primary clinical/psychosocial challenges: social functioning, medical treatments and medical safety, risk of victimization/safety, school, and transition to adulthood issues (i.e., employment and romantic relationships). With a cutoff of 75\% consensus for inclusion, identified experts produced a set of initial guidelines for clinical care. Primary themes include the importance of assessment for GD in ASD, and vice versa, as well as an extended diagnostic period, often with overlap/blurring of treatment and assessment. },

One limitation of UDSs is the potential for false-positive results caused by cross-reactivity with other substances. Amphetamines have an extensive list of cross-reacting medications. The literature contains reports of false-positive amphetamine UDSs with multiple antidepressants and antipsychotics. We present 2 cases of presumed false-positive UDSs for amphetamines after ingestion of aripiprazole. Case 1 was a 16-month-old girl who accidently ingested 15 to 45 mg of aripiprazole. She was lethargic and ataxic at home with 1 episode of vomiting containing no identifiable tablets. She remained sluggish with periods of irritability and was admitted for observation. UDS on 2 consecutive days came back positive for amphetamines. Case 2 was of a 20-month-old girl who was brought into the hospital after accidental ingestion of an unknown quantity of her father{\textquoteright}s medications which included aripiprazole. UDS on the first day of admission came back positive only for amphetamines. Confirmatory testing with gas chromatography{\textendash}mass spectrometry (GC-MS) on the blood and urine samples were also performed for both patients on presentation to detect amphetamines and were subsequently negative. Both patients returned to baseline and were discharged from the hospital. To our knowledge, these cases represent the first reports of false-positive amphetamine urine drug tests with aripiprazole. In both cases, aripiprazole was the drug with the highest likelihood of causing the positive amphetamine screen. The implications of these false-positives include the possibility of unnecessary treatment and monitoring of patients.},

  abstract  = {The use of medicines to treat attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has increased worldwide, including the use of amphetamine-based medicines or prodrugs that metabolise to amphetamine in vivo. At the same time, drugs-of-abuse testing by non-specific, point-of-care immunoassay methods (`quick tests') has increased. This article discusses the risk of `false positive' results or post-analytical misinterpretations of results when immunoassays are used to analyse biological samples from ADHD patients. A rapid evidence review was conducted to identify studies that have focused on the risk of `false positive' test results in immunoassay testing of patients treated with atomoxetine, bupropion, clonidine, guanfacine, methylphenidate, and modafinil. There is only evidence to suggest that bupropion should cause `false positive' immunoassay results. However, there is a lack of systematic, updated evaluations and validations of cross-reactivity patterns for immunoassays in the literature. Advanced laboratory methods can distinguish the use of medicines from illicit amphetamine by stereospecific analysis of dextro- and levoamphetamine; however, these analytical services are not commonly available for routine drug testing. The present situation calls for more awareness, proper education and information on these critical ethical issues in drug testing, both for clinicians, other healthcare professionals involved in drug testing and for patients in medical treatment for ADHD. The pitfalls of immunoassays due to cross-reactivity and insufficient specificity/sensitivity can have serious negative consequences for patients safety with regard to incorrect laboratory drug-testing results. Consequently, confirmatory laboratory analysis should always be performed for `presumptive' positive immunoassay screening results.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: Maintaining consistency of results over time is a challenge in laboratory medicine. Lot-to-lot reagent changes are a major threat to consistency of results. METHODS: For the period October 2007 through July 2012, we reviewed lot validation data for each new lot of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) reagents (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics) at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, and the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA. Analyses of discarded patient samples were used for comparison of lots. For the same period, we determined the distributions of reported patient results for each lot of reagents at the 2 institutions. RESULTS: Lot-to-lot validation studies identified no reagent lot as significantly different from the preceding lot. By contrast, significant lot-to-lot changes were seen in the means and medians of 105 668 reported patient IGF-I results during the period. The frequency of increased results increased nearly 2-fold to a high of 17\%, without detectable changes in the underlying patient demographics. Retrospective statistical analysis indicated that lot-to-lot comparison protocols were underpowered and that validation studies for this assay required testing \&gt;100 samples to achieve 90\% power to detect reagent lots that would significantly alter the distributions of patient results. CONCLUSIONS: The number of test samples required for adequate lot-to-lot validation protocols is high and may be prohibitively large, especially for low-volume or complex assays. Monitoring of the distributions of patient results has the potential to detect lot-to-lot inconsistencies relatively quickly. We recommend that manufacturers implement remote monitoring of patient results from analyzers in multiple institutions to allow rapid identification of between-lot result inconsistency.},

Spurious haemolysis is common at the emergency department (ED) and causes clinically relevant bias to many analyses. Blood gas analysers inability to identify hemolysis can therefore lead to clinical misinterpretations. The objective of this study was to assess the proportion of haemolytic blood gas samples performed at the ED and calculate the predictive values of a novel point-of-care solution for haemolysis detection. Approximately 100 µl of blood from anonymized syringes including venous or arterial blood was, directly after performed blood gas analysis, tested with the POC-Method (Helge H10 s-system, Hemcheck, Karlstad, Sweden) at the ED and result recorded. Thereafter the blood was centrifuged (2000 g) for 10 minutes, 100 µl of plasma put into vials and run in batches of 40 daily on an AU680 analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, California, USA) used as reference method. The threshold for clinically relevant hemolysis was defined as ≥50 mg/dL free haemoglobin. Out of 1270 samples, haemolysis was detected in 7.9\% (n = 100). The POC-method identified haemolytic samples with a sensitivity of 80\%, specificity of 99\%, positive and negative predictive values was 89\% and 98\% respectively. Spurious hemolysis is frequently present in blood gas samples at the ED and should be taken into consideration when assessed in patients. Errors could be detected directly at the point-of-care with a novel technology for hemolysis detection. },

Dates of death were collected from the National Death Register 8 years after baseline. Levels of hemoglobin, red blood cells and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration were lower after 1-year, but higher for mean corpuscular volume and IL-1β, compared to baseline or 6 month follow-up. In the Cox regression model with a time-dependent covariate, raised levels of C-reactive protein and IL-8 were associated with reduced survival time. Elevated levels of C-reactive protein and IL-8 during 1-year follow-up were related to reduce lengths of survival in elderly NHRs. },

  abstract  = { AbstractPoint-of-care testing (POCT) is a key enabling technology for disruptive and transformative innovation in healthcare, allowing tests to be performed quickly and close to the patient. This results in faster clinical decision making and new, more efficient models of care, with clinical, process and economic benefits potentially accruing to all stakeholders. Recognised barriers to the adoption of new technology such as POCT include poor understanding of current practice and thus the unmet need, the challenges of process change, and reluctance to disinvest in redundant resources resulting from improved pathway efficiency. Major contributors to this problem include a background of funding, organisation and management of healthcare that fails to recognise the complexity of a multiple stakeholder health economy seeking to become more outcomes-based and value driven. We examine the concept of a structured value proposition as a generic tool to achieve better adoption of POCT using as an example, the evidence that is available for the rapid measurement of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in the management of diabetes. We highlight the key components of the value proposition, identifying the impact of the test result on all stakeholders and the metrics which are required to define current practice (e.g. a laboratory-based HbA1c testing service), in order to develop the business case and the implementation plan required to demonstrate effective adoption of a POCT-based service. We conclude that the value proposition helps to identify the potential benefits to be gained from using POCT, and the stakeholders to whom they accrue. },

  abstract  = { AbstractExtensive research has been devoted to developing methods for assessing core body temperature, and to determine which method is most accurate. A number of wireless dermal thermometers for home use are presently available, but their relation to core body temperature and suitability for use in clinical research has hitherto not been assessed. The current study aimed to evaluate such thermometers by comparing them to the results of a rectal thermometer. Four wireless dermal thermometers for home use (FeverSmart, iThermonitor, Quest Temp Sitter, and Thermochron iButton) were applied to 15 patients during 24 h, and rectal temperature was measured at four occasions. Pearson correlation revealed moderate correlation for the Feversmart (r = 0.75), iThermonitor (r = 0.79), and Thermochron iButton (r = 0.71) systems. The Quest Temp Sitter system malfunctioned repeatedly, and the correlation (r = 0.29) for this method should therefore be assessed with caution. All dermal thermometers rendered lower average temperatures than Terumo c405 (Feversmart −0.70 ± 0.65 °C; iThermonitor −0.77 ± 0.53 °C, Quest Temp Sitter −1.18 ± 0.66 °C, and Thermochron iButton −0.87 ± 0.65 °C). Sensitivity of the dermal thermometers for detecting core temperatures ≥38.0 °C was low, ranging from 0.33 to 0.6, but improved to 0.60 to 0.80 after adjusting temperatures by the methods’ average deviation from rectal temperature. The results from the dermal thermometers tested here showed an insufficient correlation to core temperature to be used for core temperature monitoring in clinical research and practice. Unfortunately, other options for non-invasive temperature measurements are few. The two thermometers with the least unsatisfactory performance profile in our evaluations were the Feversmart and iThermonitor systems. },

  abstract  = { AbstractLow-risk thresholds for alcohol use differ across various national guidelines. To assess the novel WHO risk drinking levels in light of alcohol-sensitive common laboratory tests, we analysed biomarkers of liver status, inflammation and lipid profiles from a population-based survey of individuals classified to abstainers and different WHO risk drinking levels defined in terms of mean alcohol consumption per day. The study included 22,327 participants aged 25–74 years from the National FINRISK Study. Data on alcohol use, health status, diet, body weight and lifestyle (smoking, coffee consumption and physical activity) were recorded from structured interviews. Alcohol data from self-reports covering the past 12 months were used to categorize the participants into subgroups of abstainers and WHO risk drinking categories representing low, moderate, high and very high risk drinkers. Serum liver enzymes (GGT, ALT), C-reactive protein (CRP) and lipid profiles were measured using standard laboratory techniques. Alcohol risk category was roughly linearly related with the occurrence of elevated values for GGT, ALT and CRP. Alcohol drinking also significantly influenced the incidence of abnormalities in serum lipids. Significantly higher odds for abnormal GGT, ALT and altered lipid profiles remained in alcohol drinkers even after adjustment for age, waist circumference, physical inactivity, smoking and coffee consumption. A more systematic use of laboratory tests during treatment of individuals classified to WHO risk drinking categories may improve the assessment of alcohol-related health risks. Follow-ups of biomarker responses may also prove to be useful in health interventions aimed at reducing alcohol consumption. },

We have validated a fully automated turbidimetric method and present health-related reference limits. Calprotectin was measured by Siemens Advia XPT with the Bühlmann fCAL® turbo test (Bühlmann Laboratories AG, Schönenbuch, Switzerland), a particle enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay for quantification of calprotectin in fecal extracts. Plasma and serum samples were analysed directly, while whole blood was first extracted with M-PER® Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (ThermoFisher) and diluted with B-CAL-EX (Bühlmann). We studied analytical imprecision, estimated health-related reference limits and examined the correlation between neutrophil-calprotectin (blood-calprotectin adjusted for plasma-calprotectin) and the neutrophil count. The intermediate (‘day-to-day’) coefficient of variation was 3.5 and 1.0\% for heparin-plasma-calprotectin at 0.52 mg/L and 3.53 mg/L, respectively, and 4.9\% for heparin-blood-calprotectin at 50.2 mg/L. Health-related reference limits were 0.470–3.02 mg/L for calprotectin in heparin-plasma, 50.8–182 mg/L for calprotectin in heparin-blood, 0.534–2.41\% for the ratio between them and 24.7–33.3 pg for the mean amount of calprotectin per neutrophil. Compared to heparin-plasma, calprotectin concentrations were significantly lower in EDTA-plasma and higher in serum (p < .05). Correlation between neutrophil-calprotectin and the neutrophil count was excellent. We have shown that the Bühlmann fCAL® turbo test can be used to measure calprotectin in plasma and blood. },

Since its introduction as a diabetes monitoring tool, and its more recent application as a diagnostic tool, the number of measurements of HbA1c have risen dramatically. However, HbA1c change is slow, so repeating measurements should not be done too often. We use a large, unfiltered dataset from 52,017 patients to determine the possible rate of change in HbA1c concentration. In our laboratory, the critical difference between HbA1c measurements is 8.5\%. Our data show that a 1-unit HbA1c rise takes 4 weeks to occur, hence, at a HbA1c concentration around 50 mmol/mol Hgb, a critically increased HbA1c concentration cannot be determined until after 16 weeks. Conversely a critically lower HbA1c can manifest itself after 2 weeks, but after 7 weeks the dropping tendency stops. The amount of measurements that can be cancelled because they were taken sooner than 16 weeks is 23 percent. },

We examined cause-specific mortality and morbidity associated with NSAIDs in a nationwide cohort of MI patients.   Methods and Results By individual-level linkage of nationwide registries of hospitalization and drug dispensing from pharmacies in Denmark, patients aged >30 years admitted with first-time MI during 1997–2009 and their subsequent NSAID use were identified. The risk of three cardiovascular specific endpoints: cardiovascular death, the composite of coronary death and nonfatal MI, and the composite of fatal and nonfatal stroke, associated with NSAID use was analyzed by Cox proportional hazard analyses. Of 97,698 patients included 44.0% received NSAIDs during follow-up. Overall use of NSAIDs was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death (hazard ratio [HR] 1.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.36–1.49). In particular use of the nonselective NSAID diclofenac and the selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor rofecoxib was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular death (HR 1.96 [1.79–2.15] and HR1.66 [1.44–1.91], respectively) with a dose dependent increase in risk. Use of ibuprofen was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular death (HR 1.34[1.26–1.44]), whereas naproxen was associated with the lowest risk of (e.g., HR 1.27[1.01–1.59].   Conclusion Use of individual NSAIDs is associated with different cause-specific cardiovascular risk and in particular rofecoxib and diclofenac were associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. These results support caution with use of all NSAIDs in patients with prior MI.},

A European Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine Task and Finish Group has addressed this issue. The aim of this report is to (a) describe the Biological Variation Data Critical Appraisal Checklist (BIVAC), which verifies whether publications have included all essential elements that may impact the veracity of associated BV estimates, (b) use the BIVAC to critically appraise existing BV publications on enzymes, lipids, kidney, and diabetes-related measurands, and (c) apply metaanalysis to deliver a global within-subject BV (CVI) estimate for alanine aminotransferase (ALT).METHODS: In the BIVAC, publications were rated as A, B, C, or D, indicating descending compliance for 14 BIVAC quality items, focusing on study design, methodology, and statistical handling. A D grade indicated that associated BV estimates should not be applied in clinical practice. Systematic searches were applied to identify BV studies for 28 different measurands.RESULTS: In total, 128 publications were identified, providing 935 different BV estimates. Nine percent achieved D scores. Outlier analysis and variance homogeneity testing were scored as C in \&gt;60\% of 847 cases. Metaanalysis delivered a CVI estimate for ALT of 15.4\%.CONCLUSIONS: Application of BIVAC to BV publications identified deficiencies in required study detail and delivery, especially for statistical analysis. Those deficiencies impact the veracity of BV estimates. BV data from BIVAC-compliant studies can be combined to deliver robust global estimates for safe clinical application.},

While other mammals have thickly myelinated afferents signaling pain (ultrafast nociceptors), these have not been demonstrated in humans. Here, we performed single-unit axonal recordings (microneurography) from cutaneous mechanoreceptive afferents in healthy participants. We identified A-fiber high-threshold mechanoreceptors (A-HTMRs) that were insensitive to gentle touch, encoded noxious skin indentations, and displayed conduction velocities similar to A-fiber low-threshold mechanoreceptors. Intraneural electrical stimulation of single ultrafast A-HTMRs evoked painful percepts. Testing in patients with selective deafferentation revealed impaired pain judgments to graded mechanical stimuli only when thickly myelinated fibers were absent. This function was preserved in patients with a loss-of-function mutation in mechanotransduction channel PIEZO2. These findings demonstrate that human mechanical pain does not require PIEZO2 and can be signaled by fast-conducting, thickly myelinated afferents.},

  abstract = {This space-time study of bacteriological response compared the presence of pathogens with indicators contained in surface and groundwater in mountainous regions. A systematic search for bacteria such as Listeria, Salmonella, Campylobacter and Yersinia carried out simultaneously with a search for indicators has shown that these waters can occasionally contain potentially pathogens, though these are generally to be found in small quantities. The most common pathogens found are Campylobacter and Listeria. Salmonella has never been isolated. The presence of pathogens is usually accompanied by the presence of classic indicators of contamination such as Escherichia coli, enterococci and other aerobic bacteria. Exceptions are only to be observed in cases of samples presenting very low numbers of pathogens. Such low pathogen levels have a minimal impact on human health; but we cannot exclude that, during periods affected by specific conditions, higher levels might temporarily occur. Our research has demonstrated that classic indicators can be considered as efficient detectors of pathogens in most cases. When these indicators are used systematically and regularly, the human health hazard can be qualified as low but not negligible. The presence of pathogens, together with their survival capacity, brings the protection measures currently applied to safeguard drinking waters sharply into question.},

similar to previously reported SSU rRNA gene sequences from the Arctic Ocean, suggesting the importance of
local aerial transport processes for marine microbiota. More than 47% of the cyanobacterial OTUs in the snow

derived from local sources. Viable cyanobacteria isolated from the snow indicated free exchange between the
snow and adjacent mat communities. Other sequences were most similar to those found outside the Canadian

Bacterial communities in alpine snow on a Mont Blanc glacier, associated with four depositions of Saharan dust during the period 2006–2009, were studied using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and flow cytometry. Also, sand from the Tunisian Sahara, Saharan dust collected in Grenoble and Mont Blanc snow containing no Saharan dust (one sample of each) were analyzed. The bacterial community composition varied significantly in snow containing four dust depositions over a 3-year period. Out of 61 phylotypes recovered from dusty snow, only three phylotypes were detected in more than one sample. Overall, 15 phylotypes were recognized as potential snow colonizers. For snow samples, these phylotypes belonged to Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria, while for Saharan sand/dust samples they belonged to Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Deinococcus-Thermus and Proteobacteria. Thus, regardless of the time-scale, Saharan dust events can bring different microbiota with no common species set to alpine glaciers. This seems to be defined more by event peculiarities and aeolian transport conditions than by the bacterial load from the original dust source.},

Here we combine data from the Anorexia Nervosa Genetics Initiative (ANGI)8,9 and the Eating Disorders Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC-ED) and conduct a genome-wide association study of 16,992 cases of anorexia nervosa and 55,525 controls, identifying eight significant loci. The genetic architecture of anorexia nervosa mirrors its clinical presentation, showing significant genetic correlations with psychiatric disorders, physical activity, and metabolic (including glycemic), lipid and anthropometric traits, independent of the effects of common variants associated with body-mass index. These results further encourage a reconceptualization of anorexia nervosa as a metabo-psychiatric disorder. Elucidating the metabolic component is a critical direction for future research, and paying attention to both psychiatric and metabolic components may be key to improving outcomes.},

The extent of this problem is unknown. Our study aimed to quantify the between-subject variation of the systematic PT-INR difference between CoaguChek and a hospital laboratory method. We used register data with PT-INR results from both CoaguChek and a hospital laboratory method (STA-SPA+) in samples taken simultaneously from 108 patients. After excluding five patients with outlying results, we used mixed-effects models to estimate individual slopes and intercepts to describe the systematic relationship between the two methods for each patient, and calculated the fraction of patients having a systematic difference greater than 0.3 INR units. The included 103 patients had from 3 to 16, median seven data pairs measured over a time span from 15 to 2319, median 234 days. The mean of individual slopes was 1.113, with a standard deviation of 0.137. Corresponding values for the intercept were –0.151 and 0.208, respectively. Adjusted for the average systematic difference, the proportion of patients with a systematic difference greater than 0.3 INR units increased from 15\% at a PT-INR level of 2.5 to 50\% at a PT-INR level of 4. The systematic difference between CoaguChek and STA-SPA + varies considerably between patients. This precludes using a single, common formula to make the CoaguChek results directly comparable to the results from the hospital laboratory. },

The information retrieved and evaluated from a comparison is often limited to a scatter plot, a regression analysis and a differential plot. However, many more features and performance criteria are available from the same data. Access to a comprehensive set of information can also be used to harmonize results by recalibration and estimate any risk in applying alternate methods or surrogates to reference methods. Common principles for comparison of results are explained. Well known and new relations between commonly used methods and their limitations are discussed. A new application of the empirical folded density functions is introduced, and the use of a simplified error grid in the evaluation of a comparison is explored. Parametric and nonparametric pairwise significance tests and a convenient option of partitioning and limiting the dataset, ordinary linear and Deming regression functions, including uncertainties of the constants are provided in an Excel spreadsheet that is submitted as a downloadable supplemental file. The information harboured in a split sample comparison of methods is explored in detail. Procedures cover the main content of CLSI recommendations EP9, EP21 and EP27. Several additional practical procedures are described in a submitted single spreadsheet program.

  abstract  = {Much of what we know about the evolution of altruism comes from animals. Here, we show that studying a microbe has yielded unique insights, particularly in understanding how social cheaters are controlled. The social stage of Dictylostelium discoideum occurs when the amoebae run out of their bacterial prey and aggregate into a multicellular, motile slug. This slug forms a fruiting body in which about a fifth of cells die to form a stalk that supports the remaining cells as they form hardy dispersal-ready spores. Because this social stage forms from aggregation, it is analogous to a social group, or a chimeric multicellular organism, and is vulnerable to internal conflict. Advances in cell labeling, microscopy, single-gene knockouts, and genomics, as well as the results of decades of study of D. discoideum as a model for development, allow us to explore the genetic basis of social contests and control of cheaters in unprecedented detail. Cheaters are limited from exploiting other clones by high relatedness, kin discrimination, pleiotropy, noble resistance, and lottery-like role assignment. The active nature of these limits is reflected in the elevated rates of change in social genes compared with nonsocial genes. Despite control of cheaters, some conflict is still expressed in chimeras, with slower movement of slugs, slightly decreased investment in stalk compared with spore cells, and differential contributions to stalk and spores. D. discoideum is rapidly becoming a model system of choice for molecular studies of social evolution.},

  abstract = { Little is known about respiratory muscle function in acute undernutrition, although an inadequate caloric intake is common in numerous disease states. Twelve young-adult, healthy female volunteers performed two familiarization experiments and were then studied after 7 days of consuming 40\% of normal daily caloric intake as well as after 1 wk of normal caloric intake. In each experiment subjects performed tests of resting pulmonary function, inspiratory muscle strength, and ventilatory endurance, the last of which involved two 60-s and two 6-min isocapnic maximum voluntary ventilation maneuvers. Subjects then walked to exhaustion in 8–20 min on a treadmill. The caloric restriction did not affect performance of any breathing test but did lower endurance time in severe treadmill exercise (P less than 0.05). Basal metabolic rate was lowered, resting blood levels of free fatty acids and beta-hydroxybutyrate elevated, and glucose lowered following the caloric restriction (P less than 0.05). Blood lactate levels were lower during and after exercise following caloric restriction (P less than 0.05). We conclude that ventilatory muscle strength and endurance are fully preserved in caloric restriction severe enough to cause mild ketoacidosis and hypoglycemia, lowered basal metabolic rate, and decreased endurance in severe treadmill exercise. },

The purpose of this study was to test the hypotheses that 21 days of CR in lean subjects would 1) result in significant losses of lean mass despite a suppression in leucine turnover and oxidation and 2) negatively impact exercise performance. Nine young, normal-weight men [23 ± 5 y, 78.6 ± 5.7 kg, peak oxygen consumption (V̇o2 peak) 45.2 ± 7.3 ml·kg−1·min−1, mean ± SD] were underfed by 40\% of the calories required to maintain body weight for 21 days and lost 3.8 ± 0.3 kg body wt and 2.0 ± 0.4 kg lean mass. Protein intake was kept at 1.2 g·kg−1·day−1. Leucine kinetics were measured using α-ketoisocaproic acid reciprocal pool model in the postabsorptive state during rest and 50 min of exercise (EX) at 50\% of V̇o2 peak. Body composition, basal metabolic rate (BMR), and exercise performance were measured throughout the intervention. At rest, leucine flux (≈131 μmol·kg−1·h−1) and oxidation (Rox; ≈19 μmol·kg−1·h−1) did not differ pre- and post-CR. During EX, leucine flux (129 ± 6 vs. 121 ± 6) and Rox (54 ± 6 vs. 46 ± 8) were lower after CR than they were pre-CR. Nitrogen balance was negative throughout the intervention (≈3.0g N/day), and BMR declined from 1,898 ± 262 to 1,670 ± 203 kcal/day. Aerobic performance (V̇o2 peak, endurance cycling) was not impacted by CR, but arm flexion endurance decreased by 20\%. In conclusion, 3 wk of caloric restriction reduced leucine flux and Rox during exercise in normal-weight young men. However, despite negative nitrogen balance and loss of lean mass, whole body exercise performance was well maintained in response to CR. },

(BMR) developed by Schofield (Schofield database), Henry (Oxford database) and
Cole (Oxford database) using mean values for age, weight, height and BMR of
published studies.
Design: Literature review of studies published from 1985 to March 2002.
Setting: All studies selected used appropriate methods and followed conditions that
met the criteria established for basal metabolism, were performed in healthy adults,
and were not part of the Schofield or Oxford database.
Subjects: A total of 261 groups of men and women from 175 studies were selected and
categorised in three age groups (18.5–29.9, 30.0–59.9, $60 years old) and three body
mass index (BMI) groups (normal weight, overweight and obese).
Results: Linear regression and concordance correlation analysis showed that the three
sets of equations had the same association and agreement with measured BMR, across
gender, age, and BMI groups. The agreement of all equations was moderate for men
and poor for women. The lowest mean squared prediction errors (MSPRs) were given
by Henry equations in men and Cole equations in women. Henry and Cole equations
gave lower values than Schofield equations, except for men over 60 years of age.
Henry equations were the most accurate in men. None of the three equations
performed consistently better in women.
Conclusion: These results support the use of Henry equations in men with a wide
range of age and BMI. None of the proposed predictive equations seem to be
appropriate to estimate BMR in women},

Later studies on humans have also found a detrimental effect of fasting on exercise endurance, with the exception of 1 study which found no difference. The discrepancy between humans and rats could not be explained by level of glycogen sparing, mode of exercise, duration of the fast, physiological differences or level of training. The intensity of exercise, and a potential placebo effect of fasting, are possible reasons for the conflicting results. Despite reduced endurance performance, fasted humans are able to exercise and maintain blood glucose homeostasis; the specific cause of an earlier onset of fatigue during a single bout of exercise in the fasted state remains unclear.},

Each subject completed two exercise tests at the same treadmill speed (set at 70\% maximal O2 uptake), one following a 27-h fast and one 3 h after a preexercise meal, in random order. Fasting caused a 44.7 +/- 5.8\% (SE) decrease in endurance performance (P less than 0.01). Blood, muscle, psychological, and ventilatory data were examined to determine the cause of the decreased performance. Fasting caused significant increases in O2 uptake (9.3 +/- 2.0\%), heart rate (8.4 +/- 2.4\%), and rating of perceived exertion, ventilation, and psychological fatigue, evident within the first 60 min of exercise. There were no differences in plasma glucose or epinephrine levels. Muscle glycogen degraded at the same rate (0.482 +/- 0.146 vs. 0.470 +/- 0.281 mumol.g-1.min-1 in the nonfasted and fasted tests, respectively) despite lower respiratory exchange ratio and elevated free fatty acid levels, which may partially explain the elevated O2 uptake. Lactate, insulin, and norepinephrine were all increased in the fasted test (P less than 0.05). The increase in norepinephrine (r = 0.79, P less than 0.01), the diameter of type I muscle fibers (r = 0.70, P less than 0.05), and ending insulin levels (r = -0.88, P less than 0.01) were correlated with endurance time in the fasted state. Fatigue in endurance running for 27-h fasted humans appears to be related to a combination of physiological, psychological, metabolic, and hormonal changes. },

Fasting produced significant elevations in the resting concentrations of blood free fatty acids (FFA; 1.16 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.56 +/- 0.06 mM, F vs. PA, respectively, a 107\% increase), beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OH, 2.06 +/- 0.66 vs. 0.15 +/- 0.06 mM, a 1,270\% increase), and glycerol (0.12 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.04 +/- 0.01 mM, a 200\% increase), with a significant decline in glucose (79.79 +/- 2.12 vs. 98.88 +/- 3.11 mg/dl, a 19\% decrease). Exercise in the F trial increased FFA, decreased glucose, and significantly elevated beta-OH and glycerol over the PA trial. There was no difference in blood glucose concentration between trials at exhaustion. However, F produced a significant decrement in exercise endurance time compared with the PA trial (88.9 +/- 18.3 vs. 144.4 +/- 22.6 min, F vs. PA, a 38\% decrease). Based on the respiratory exchange ratio, fasting led to a greater utilization of lipids during rest and exercise. It was concluded that 1) a 36-h fast significantly altered substrate utilization at rest and throughout exercise to exhaustion, 2) glucose levels do not appear to be the single determinant of time to exhaustion in submaximal exercise, and 3) despite the apparent sparing of carbohydrate utilization with the 36-h fast, endurance performance was significantly decreased. },

The major physiological adaptations that allow breath-hold divers to achieve such depths and duration are called the ``diving response'' that is comprised of peripheral vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure, bradycardia, decreased cardiac output, increased cerebral and myocardial blood flow, splenic contraction, and preserved O2 delivery to the brain and heart. This complex of physiological adaptations is not unique to humans, but can be found in all diving mammals. Despite these profound physiological adaptations, divers may frequently show hypoxic loss of consciousness. The breath-hold starts with an easy-going phase in which respiratory muscles are inactive, whereas during the second so-called ``struggle'' phase, involuntary breathing movements start. These contractions increase cerebral blood flow by facilitating left stroke volume, cardiac output, and arterial pressure. The analysis of the compensatory mechanisms involved in maximal breath-holds can improve brain survival during conditions involving profound brain hypoperfusion and deoxygenation.},

Data were analyzed from September 23, 2016 through February 4, 2018.Across 5 countries, models were fitted to estimate variance components describing the total variance in risk for ASD occurrence owing to additive genetics, maternal, and shared and nonshared environmental effects.The analytic sample included 2 001 631 individuals, of whom 1 027 546 (51.3%) were male. Among the entire sample, 22 156 were diagnosed with ASD. The median (95% CI) ASD heritability was 80.8% (73.2%-85.5%) for country-specific point estimates, ranging from 50.9% (25.1%-75.6%) (Finland) to 86.8% (69.8%-100.0%) (Israel). For the Nordic countries combined, heritability estimates ranged from 81.2% (73.9%-85.3%) to 82.7% (79.1%-86.0%). Maternal effect was estimated to range from 0.4% to 1.6%. Estimates of genetic, maternal, and environmental effects for autistic disorder were similar with ASD.Based on population data from 5 countries, the heritability of ASD was estimated to be approximately 80%, indicating that the variation in ASD occurrence in the population is mostly owing to inherited genetic influences, with no support for contribution from maternal effects. The results suggest possible modest differences in the sources of ASD risk between countries.},

We evaluated the analytical performance of HI on two different platforms. Further, the impact of implementing analytically and clinically derived sample rejection criteria was investigated. Precision profiles were established, and analytical error was assessed by comparison with the reference method for hemoglobin measurement on Architect c8000/c16000 (Abbott) and Cobas c702 (Roche Diagnostics) instruments. The impact of a more analyte-specific cut off based on analytical and biologival variation was examined for five hemolysis-sensitive plasma analyses according to European recommendations. Lastly, a reference interval was established for the HI on Cobas, using the CLSI C28A3c nonparametric method. Imprecision for HI of 0.6-3.0 \% for Architect and 1.5-4.5 \% for Cobas was considered acceptable, which also applied for trueness in the measuring tange > 2 g/L. If cutoffs based on analytical and biological variation were used to manage results from hemolyzed samples, more potassium, LDH, conjugated bilirubin and phosphate results would be suppressed. Considering RCV only LDS remained sensitive to hemolysis. The Cobas-based HI reference interval was established to 0.01–0.16 g/L. Thorough verification of the HI on two different clinical chemistry analyzers reveals acceptable analytical performance. HI cutoffs suggested by manufacturers may be optimized by clinical laboratories using analytical and/or biological variation. A reference interval for the HI analysis is relevant as the analysis has been suggested as a diagnostic tool in the assessment of in vivo hemolysis. },

As the likelihood of falling victim to a cyberattack has increased over time, so too has the need to understand exactly what is effective corporate communication after an attack, and how best to engage the concerns of customers, partners and other stakeholders. This research seeks to tackle this problem through a critical, multi-faceted investigation into the efficacy of crisis communication and public relations following a data breach. It does so by drawing on academic literature, obtained through a systematic literature review, and real-world case studies. Qualitative data analysis is used to interpret and structure the results, allowing for the development of a new, comprehensive framework for corporate communication to support companies in their preparation and response to such events. The validity of this framework is demonstrated by its evaluation through interviews with senior industry professionals, as well as a critical assessment against relevant practice and research. The framework is further refined based on these evaluations, and an updated version defined. This research represents the first grounded, comprehensive and evaluated proposal for characterising effective corporate communication after cyber security incidents.},

  abstract = { Bland and Altman's (1986, Lancet 327: 307–310) limits of agreement have been used in many clinical research settings to assess agreement between two methods of measuring a quantitative characteristic. However, when the variances of the measurement errors of the two methods differ, limits of agreement can be misleading. biasplot implements a new statistical methodology that Taffé (Forthcoming, Statistical Methods in Medical Research) recently developed to circumvent this issue and assess bias and precision of the two measurement methods (one is the reference standard, and the other is the new measurement method to be evaluated). biasplot produces three new plots introduced by Taffé: the “bias plot”, “precision plot”, and “comparison plot”. These help the investigator visually evaluate the performance of the new measurement method. In this article, we introduce the user-written command biasplot and present worked examples using simulated data included with the package. Note that the Taffé method assumes there are several measurements from the reference standard and possibly as few as one measurement from the new method for each individual. },

  abstract  = { AbstractThe aim of this study was to establish creatinine growth curves separately for males and females that can be used to adjust childhood levels of serum creatinine to corresponding adult levels. Linear regression with fractional polynomials of age as independent variable was used to construct creatinine growth curves for a reference cohort (n = 83,157 samples from Belgium and Sweden, age 2–40 years). Adjusted creatinine obtained from the growth curves was used to improve accuracy of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) based on the Lund–Malmö revised (LMR) equation in children. The LMR equation based on creatinine values adjusted to age 18 years was validated against measured GFR (mGFR) in a separate cohort of 4005 children from four different European countries. Validation metrics included median bias, precision, and accuracy expressed as percentage of estimates within ±30\% (P30) of mGFR. Remarkable improvements in bias and accuracy were observed; P30 increased from 56\% to 74\% after creatinine adjustments in children with mGFR <75 mL/min/1.73 m2 (n = 932), while P30 was relatively unchanged (89–90\%) at mGFR ≥75 mL/min/1.73 m2 (n = 3073). The suggested approach with adjusted creatinine makes LMR applicable in children irrespective of their renal function. },

A total of 147 895 singleton children delivered vaginally between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2015, in a single integrated health care system were included. Children were followed up from the age of 1 year until the first date of the following occurrences: clinical diagnosis of ASD, last date of health plan enrollment, death, or the study end date of December 31, 2018.Use and duration of LEA.The main outcome was clinical diagnosis of ASD. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of ASD associated with LEA exposure.Among the cohort of 147 895 singleton children (74 425 boys [50.3\\%]; mean [SD] gestational age at delivery, 38.9 [1.5] weeks), 109 719 (74.2\\%) were exposed to maternal LEA. Fever during labor was observed in 13 055 mothers (11.9\\%) in the LEA group and 510 of 38 176 mothers (1.3\\%) in the non-LEA group. Autism spectrum disorders were diagnosed in 2039 children (1.9\\%) in the LEA group and 485 children (1.3\\%) in the non-LEA group. After adjusting for potential confounders, including birth year, medical center, maternal age at delivery, parity, race/ethnicity, educational level, household income, history of comorbidity, diabetes during pregnancy, smoking during pregnancy, preeclampsia or eclampsia, prepregnancy body mass index, gestational weight gain, gestational age at delivery, and birth weight, the HR associated with LEA vs non-LEA exposure was 1.37 (95\\% CI, 1.23-1.53). Relative to the unexposed group, the adjusted HR associated with LEA exposure of less than 4 hours was 1.33 (95\\% CI, 1.17-1.53), with LEA exposure of 4 to 8 hours was 1.35 (95\\% CI, 1.20-1.53), and with LEA exposure of more than 8 hours was 1.46 (95\\% CI, 1.27-1.69). Within the LEA group, there was a significant trend of ASD risk associated with increasing duration of LEA exposure after adjusting for covariates (HR for linear trend, 1.05 [95\\% CI, 1.01-1.09] per 4 hours). Adding fever to the model did not change the HR estimate associated with LEA exposure (adjusted HR for LEA vs non-LEA, 1.37 [95\\% CI, 1.22-1.53]).This study suggests that maternal LEA may be associated with increased ASD risk in children. The risk appears to not be directly associated with epidural-related maternal fever.}},

  abstract = {Background
Many different equations have been previously described to estimate plasma osmolality. The aim of this study is to compare 14 of these equations, in order to determine which results agree best with measured osmolality.
Objectives
Our aim is to elucidate which is the most accurate equation for osmolality calculation among the fourteen that were previously described.
Methods
We measured osmolality by the freezing point depression method, and glucose, urea, sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium concentrations with Unicell DXC 800 analyzer. Goodness-of-fit rates were calculated using the Passing–Bablok regression model and the t-paired sample test. In addition, we used survival curves in order to find the percentage of cases in which the difference between measured and calculated osmolality was under 10mOsm/kg. Data were plotted using the Bland–Altman graphical approach.
Results
The equation that provides the best fit between measured and calculated osmolality is 1.86(Na+K)+1.15(Glu/18)+(Urea/6)+14, followed by 2Na+1.15(Glu/18)+(Urea/6).
Conclusions
According to our results, the Dorwart–Chalmer's equation should not be used for osmolality calculations. The equation 1.86(Na+K)+1.15(Glu/18)+(Urea/6)+14 is the most accurate. The widespread use of the equation 2(Na+K)+(Glu/18)+(Urea/6) is also acceptable.},

The rise of the current digital culture coincides with longstanding scientific questions about why humans sometimes remember and sometimes forget, and why some individuals remember better than others2-6. Here we examine whether spontaneous attention lapses--in the moment7-12, across individuals13-15 and as a function of everyday media multitasking16-19--negatively correlate with remembering. Electroencephalography and pupillometry measures of attention20,21 were recorded as eighty young adults (mean age, 21.7 years) performed a goal-directed episodic encoding and retrieval task22. Trait-level sustained attention was further quantified using task-based23 and questionnaire measures24,25. Using trial-to-trial retrieval data, we show that tonic lapses in attention in the moment before remembering, assayed by posterior alpha power and pupil diameter, were correlated with reductions in neural signals of goal coding and memory, along with behavioural forgetting. Independent measures of trait-level attention lapsing mediated the relationship between neural assays of lapsing and memory performance, and between media multitasking and memory. Attention lapses partially account for why we remember or forget in the moment, and why some individuals remember better than others. Heavier media multitasking is associated with a propensity to have attention lapses and forget.},

The correct statistical approach to assess this degree of agreement is not obvious. Correlation and regression studies are frequently proposed. However, correlation studies the relationship between one variable and another, not the differences, and it is not recommended as a method for assessing the comparability between methods.  In 1983 Altman and Bland (B&A) proposed an alternative analysis, based on the quantification of the agreement between two quantitative measurements by studying the mean difference and constructing limits of agreement.  The B&A plot analysis is a simple way to evaluate a bias between the mean differences, and to estimate an agreement interval, within which 95% of the differences of the second method, compared to the first one, fall. Data can be analyzed both as unit differences plot and as percentage differences plot.  The B&A plot method only defines the intervals of agreements, it does not say whether those limits are acceptable or not. Acceptable limits must be defined a priori, based on clinical necessity, biological considerations or other goals.  The aim of this article is to provide guidance on the use and interpretation of Bland Altman analysis in method comparison studies.},

  abstract  = {The analysis of clinical samples, population samples, and controlled trials is typically subjected to rigorous statistical review. This fact is understandable, given that the results of clinical investigation will often be used to inform patient care or clinical decision making. One would not want to predicate patient advice on research findings that are not correctly interpreted or valid. For this reason, most major journals publishing clinical research include statistical reviews as a standard component of manuscript evaluation for publication. Clinical data, regardless of publication venue, are often subject to rather uniform principles of review.
In contrast, basic science studies are often handled less uniformly, perhaps because of the unique challenges inherent in this type of investigation. A single basic science manuscript, for example, can span several scientific disciplines and involve biochemistry, cell culture, model animal systems, and even selected clinical samples. Such a manuscript structure is a challenge for analysis and statistical review. Not all journals publishing basic science articles use statistical consultation, although it is becoming increasingly common.1 In addition, most statistical reviewers are more comfortable with clinical study design than with basic science research. Consequently, there are multiple reasons why the statistical analysis of basic science research might be suboptimal. In this review, we focused on common sources of confusion and errors in the analysis and interpretation of basic science studies. The issues addressed are seen repeatedly in the authors' editorial experience, and we hope this article will serve as a guide for those who may submit their basic science studies to journals that publish both clinical and basic science research. We have discussed issues related to sample size and power, study design, data analysis, and presentation of results (more details are provided by Katz2 and Rosner3). We then illustrated these issues using a set of examples from basic science research studies.},

Additional objectives include describing the epidemiology of tick-transmitted viruses, identifying the most common tick vectors of viral pathogens in the United States, identifying the most common tick-transmitted viruses worldwide, and recommending effective strategies for the prevention and treatment of tickborne viral infections. Flaviviruses transmitted by ixodid ticks cause most tickborne viral infections that present clinically as either encephalitis or hemorrhagic fever. Recently, several new tickborne viruses have emerged in the United States, including Bourbon virus, Heartland virus, Powassan virus, and the severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus transmitted by a tick recently introduced from China, the Asian long-horned tick (Haemaphysalis longicornis). In most cases, there are no specific drug therapies for tickborne viral infections, and treatment is supportive. Vaccination, personal protection, landscape management, and wildlife management are all effective strategies for the primary prevention and control of tickborne viral infectious diseases.

To understand the JAMA article featured here, it must be placed in the context of the evolving HT research at the time. Long recognized as the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms in early menopause, a larger role for systemic HT in the prevention of osteoporosis, coronary heart disease (CHD), dementia, and other chronic diseases of aging began to emerge by the 1980s and 1990s, based predominantly on observational research (1–3). In numerous observational studies, women using estrogen or estrogen-progestogen therapy experienced lower rates of CHD and other chronic diseases than nonusers. Estrogen therapy became one of the widely prescribed medications in the world. Also, due to presumed cardioprotection, HT came to be perceived as potentially of greatest benefit to women at highest risk of CHD. In 1992, the American College of Physicians recommended that HT be considered for CHD risk reduction in high-risk women, based on the premise that these women would have the most to gain from such treatment (4).}},

This  study  compares  the  performance  of  the  Modification  of  Diet  in  Renal  Disease  (MDRD)  study  and  Chronic  Kidney  Disease  Epidemiology  Collaboration  (CKD-EPI)  equations  with  the  revised  Lund-Malmö  equa-tion  (LM  Revised),  a  new  equation  that  can  be  expected  to  handle  changes  in  GFR  across  the  life  span  more  accurately.

Methods:  The  study  included  3495  examinations  in  2847  adult   Swedish   patients   referred   for   measurement   of   GFR  (mGFR)  2008–2010  by  plasma  clearance  of  iohexol  (median 52 mL/min/1.73 m2). Bias, precision [interquartile range (IQR)] and accuracy [percentage of estimates  ± 10% (P10) and  ± 30% (P30) of mGFR] were compared.Results:   The   overall   results   of   LM   Revised/MDRD/CKD-EPI  were:  median  bias  2%/8%/11%,  IQR  12/14/14  mL/min/1.73 m2, P10 40%/35%/35% and P30 84%/75%/76%. LM  Revised  was  the  most  stable  equation  in  terms  of  bias,  precision  and  accuracy  across  mGFR,  age  and  BMI  intervals   irrespective   of   gender.   MDRD   and   CKD-EPI   overestimated  mGFR  in  patients  with  decreased  kidney  function,  young  adults  and  elderly.  All  three  equations  overestimated  mGFR  and  had  low  accuracy  in  patients  with BMI  < 20 kg/m2, most pronounced among men.

Conclusions: In settings similar to the investigated cohort LM  Revised  should  be  preferred  to  MDRD  and  CKD-EPI  due  to  its  higher  accuracy  and  more  stable  performance  across GFR, age and BMI intervals.

inherited trait. Although some people find PROP to be extremely
bitter, others cannot distinguish PROP solutions from plain water.
In a series of studies, greater PROP sensitivity was linked with
lower acceptability of other bitter compounds and with lower reported liking for some bitter foods. Women, identified as “supertasters” of PROP, had lower acceptance scores for grapefruit
juice, green tea, Brussels sprouts, and some soy products. Many of
these foods contain bitter phytochemicals with reputed cancerprotective activity. These include flavonoids in citrus fruit, polyphenols in green tea and red wine, glucosinolates in cruciferous vegetables, and isoflavones in soy products. Consumer acceptance of
these plant-based foods may depend critically on inherited taste
factors. This review examines the role of genetic taste markers in

Injury due to psychological overload was the most salient type of healthcare worker hazard. Patient and healthcare worker safety went hand in hand. Good patient safety was present when caregivers had good access to their psychological and social capacities. These functions were jeopardized by stress. Our results indicated that quantitative overload, excessive cognitive and emotional complexity, lack of social support and good teamwork, organizational instability, and distrust for and frustration with the way healthcare organizations were managed, caused stress related function impairment in staff, which lead to mistakes and near misses. These aspects also in themselves contributed to risks. Good safety was associated with adequate resources and routines, workplace learning, and supportive unit level managers and colleagues. Features of professional cultures related to ethical norms to offer best possible care for the patient, in spite of insufficient resources, contributed to acceptance of working conditions that could lead to stress and overload.},

By establishing sex-specific creatinine growth curves for children and young adults, creatinine levels of children and young adults below age 40 years were adjusted with 40 as assigned age and applied in the CKD-EPI equation. Validation was performed in 4005 children (2–17 years) and 3309 young adults (18–39 years) using metrics based on bias, precision, and accuracy including percentage of estimates within 30% (P30) of measured GFR (mGFR). Comparisons were made with the CKiD and Schwartz-Lyon equations in children. CKD-EPI with age-adjusted creatinine instead of actual age and creatinine led to extensive improvements in bias, precision, and accuracy at all ages, in both sexes and at all levels of mGFR. At mGFR below and above 75 mL/min/1.73m2, the P30 increased from 12% to 75% and 33% to 88% in children, respectively, and from 56% to 73% and 83% to 92% in young adults, respectively. In children adjusted CKD-EPI was more accurate than CKiD, especially above mGFR 75 mL/min/1.73m2 (P30 88% vs. 82%), while Schwartz-Lyon was more accurate than adjusted CKD-EPI at mGFR below 75 mL/min/1.73m2 (P30 81% vs. 75%). Thus, the proposed strategy based on age-adjusted creatinine in children and young adults makes the CKD-EPI equation applicable across the full spectrum of age and kidney function.},

Background
Measuring 24 h-urine calcium concentration is essential to evaluate calcium metabolism and excretion. Manufacturers recommend acidifying the urine before a measurement to ensure calcium solubility, but the literature offers controversial information on this pre-analytical treatment. The objectives of the study were (1) to compare pre-acidification (during urine collection) versus post-acidification (in the laboratory), and (2) to evaluate the impact of acidification on urinary calcium measurements in a large cohort.

Methods
We evaluated the effects of pre- and post-acidification on 24-h urine samples collected from 10 healthy volunteers. We further studied the impact of acidification on the calcium results for 567 urine samples from routine laboratory practice, including 46 hypercalciuria (≥7.5 mmol/24 h) samples.

Results
Calciuria values in healthy volunteers ranged from 0.6 to 12.5 mmol/24 h, and no statistical significance was found between non-acidified, pre-acidified and post-acidified conditions. A comparison of the values (ranging from 0.21 to 29.32 mmol/L) for 567 urine samples before and after acidification indicated 25 samples (4.4%) with analytical differences outside limits of acceptance. The bias observed for these deviant values ranged from −3.07 to 1.32 mmol/L; no patient was re-classified as hypercalciuric after acidification, and three patients with hypercalciuria were classified as normocalciuric after acidification. These three deviant patients represent 6.5% of hypercalciuric patients.

Conclusions
Our results indicate that pre- and post-acidification of urine is not necessary prior to routine calcium analysis.

  abstract      = {Altered sleep/wake patterns involve, by definition, displaced sleep. The present review concludes that mental performance is strongly influenced by many forms of displaced sleep. Being exposed to the circadian low (during work/activity), extended time awake or reduced duration of sleep will impair performance. The effect is most pronounced in the laboratory setting, however, even if a number of studies have shown effects of for example night work on neuropsychological tests, and simulated work. In real shift work situations performance changes have been less pronounced. No studies have evaluated the effects on production, but accidents and serious mistakes have been clearly established in road transport and there seems to be clear effects also in health care. The effects are similar in connection with flights across several time zones (jet lag) but less data are available. It is suggested that there is a need for establishing the significance of impaired performance due to work hours in white collar and service work. Also the notion of individual differences in performance impairment is an important issue. },

While measures of sleep latency, continuous encephalographical/electro-oculographical (EEG/EOG) recording and performance tests are useful indicators of sleepiness in the laboratory and clinic, they are not easily implemented in large, real-life field studies. Subjective ratings of sleepiness, which are easily applied and unobtrusive, are an alternative, but whether they measure sleepiness sensitively, reliably and validly remains uncertain. This review brings together research relevant to these issues. It is focused on the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), which is a nine-point Likert-type scale. The diurnal pattern of sleepiness is U-shaped, with high KSS values in the morning and late evening, and with great stability across years. KSS values increase sensitively during acute total and repeated partial sleep deprivation and night work, including night driving. The effect sizes range between 1.5 and 3. The relation to driving performance or EEG/EOG indicators of sleepiness is highly significant, strongly curvilinear and consistent across individuals. High (>6) KSS values are associated particularly with impaired driving performance and sleep intrusions in the EEG. KSS values are also increased in many clinical conditions such as sleep apnea, depression and burnout. The context has a strong influence on KSS ratings. Thus, physical activity, social interaction and light exposure will reduce KSS values by 1â2 units. In contrast, time-on-task in a monotonous context will increase KSS values by 1â2 units. In summary, subjective ratings of sleepiness as described here is as sensitive and valid an indicator of sleepiness as objective measures, and particularly suitable for field studies.},

An informal meta-analysis was designed to investigate the basis of this diversity across different primate societies. Species were included only if a substantial amount of published information was available regarding both social behavior and rank-related differences in stress physiology. Four Old World and three New World species met these criteria, including societies varying from small-group, singular cooperative breeders (common marmoset and cotton top tamarin) to large-troop, multi-male, multi-female polygynous mating systems (rhesus, cynomolgus, talapoin, squirrel monkeys, and olive baboon). A questionnaire was formulated to obtain information necessary to characterize the stress milieu for individuals in particular primate societies. We standardized cortisol values within each species by calculating the ratio of basal cortisol concentrations of subordinates to those of dominants in stable dominance hierarchies and expressing the ratio as a percentage (relative cortisol levels). The meta-analysis identified two variables that significantly predicted relative cortisol levels: subordinates exhibited higher relative cortisol levels when they (1) were subjected to higher rates of stressors, and (2) experienced decreased opportunities for social (including close kin) support. These findings have important implications for understanding the different physiological consequences of dominant and subordinate social status across primate societies and how social rank may differ in its behavioral and physiological manifestations among primate societies. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

I examine whether mammals with larger levels of RE are more or less likely to be at risk of endangerment than less-encephalized species. I find that extant species with large levels of encephalization are at greater risk of endangerment, with this effect being strongest in species with small body sizes. These results suggest that RE could be a valuable asset in estimating extinction vulnerability. Additionally, these findings suggest that the cost{\textendash}benefit trade-off of RE is different in large-bodied species when compared with small-bodied species.},

However, their use in ion sieving and desalination technologies is limited by a permeation cutoff of ∼9 {\r{A}} (ref. 4), which is larger than the diameters of hydrated ions of common salts4, 6. The cutoff is determined by the interlayer spacing (d) of ∼13.5 {\r{A}}, typical for graphene oxide laminates that swell in water2, 4. Achieving smaller d for the laminates immersed in water has proved to be a challenge. Here, we describe how to control d by physical confinement and achieve accurate and tunable ion sieving. Membranes with d from ∼9.8 {\r{A}} to 6.4 {\r{A}} are demonstrated, providing a sieve size smaller than the diameters of hydrated ions. In this regime, ion permeation is found to be thermally activated with energy barriers of ∼10–100 kJ mol–1 depending on d. Importantly, permeation rates decrease exponentially with decreasing sieve size but water transport is weakly affected (by a factor of <2). The latter is attributed to a low barrier for the entry of water molecules and large slip lengths inside graphene capillaries. Building on these findings, we demonstrate a simple scalable method to obtain graphene-based membranes with limited swelling, which exhibit 97% rejection for NaCl.},

  abstract      = {BACKGROUND: All animals thus far studied sleep, but little is known about the ecological factors that generate differences in sleep characteristics across species, such as total sleep duration or division of sleep into multiple bouts across the 24-hour period (i.e., monophasic or polyphasic sleep activity). Here we address these questions using an evolutionary agent-based model. The model is spatially explicit, with food and sleep sites distributed in two clusters on the landscape. Agents acquire food and sleep energy based on an internal circadian clock coded by 24 traits (one for each hour of the day) that correspond to "genes" that evolve by means of a genetic algorithm. These traits can assume three different values that specify the agents' behavior: sleep (or search for a sleep site), eat (or search for a food site), or flexibly decide action based on relative levels of sleep energy and food energy. Individuals with higher fitness scores leave more offspring in the next generation of the simulation, and the model can therefore be used to identify evolutionarily adaptive circadian clock parameters under different ecological conditions.RESULTS:We systematically varied input parameters related to the number of food and sleep sites, the degree to which food and sleep sites overlap, and the rate at which food patches were depleted. Our results reveal that: (1) the increased costs of traveling between more spatially separated food and sleep clusters select for monophasic sleep, (2) more rapid food patch depletion reduces sleep times, and (3) agents spend more time attempting to acquire the "rarer" resource, that is, the average time spent sleeping is positively correlated with the number of food patches and negatively correlated with the number of sleep patches. "Flexible" genes, in general, do not appear to be advantageous, though their arrangements in the agents' genome show characteristic patterns that suggest that selection acts on their distribution.CONCLUSION:Collectively, the output suggests that ecological factors can have striking effects on sleep patterns. Moreover, our results demonstrate that a simple model can produce clear and sensible patterns, thus allowing it to be used to investigate a wide range of questions concerning the ecology of sleep. Quantitative data presently are unavailable to test the model predictions directly, but patterns are consistent with comparative evidence from different species, and the model can be used to target ecological factors to investigate in future research.},

  abstract      = {Abstract Metabolic pathways involved in lactate metabolism are important to understand the physiological response to exercise and the pathogenesis of prevalent diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Monocarboxylate transporters are being investigated as potential targets for diagnosis and therapy of these and other disorders. Glucose and alanine produce pyruvate which is reduced to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase in the cytoplasm without oxygen consumption. Lactate removal takes place via its oxidation to pyruvate by lactate dehydrogenase. Pyruvate may be either oxidized to carbon dioxide producing energy or transformed into glucose. Pyruvate oxidation requires oxygen supply and the cooperation of pyruvate dehydrogenase, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Enzymes of the gluconeogenesis pathway sequentially convert pyruvate into glucose. Congenital or acquired deficiency on gluconeogenesis or pyruvate oxidation, including tissue hypoxia, may induce lactate accumulation. Both obese individuals and patients with diabetes show elevated plasma lactate concentration compared to healthy subjects, but there is no conclusive evidence of hyperlactatemia causing insulin resistance. Available evidence suggests an association between defective mitochondrial oxidative capacity in the pancreatic Î²-cells and diminished insulin secretion that may trigger the development of diabetes in patients already affected with insulin resistance. Several mutations in the mitochondrial \{DNA\} are associated with diabetes mellitus, although the pathogenesis remains unsettled. Mitochondrial \{DNA\} mutations have been detected in a number of human cancers. d-lactate is a lactate enantiomer normally formed during glycolysis. Excess d-lactate is generated in diabetes, particularly during diabetic ketoacidosis. d-lactic acidosis is typically associated with small bowel resection. },

  abstract      = {Two experiments examined the testing effect with open-book tests, in which students view notes and textbooks while taking the test, and closed-book tests, in which students take the test without viewing notes or textbooks. Subjects studied prose passages and then restudied or took an open- or closed-book test. Taking either kind of test, with feedback, enhanced long-term retention relative to conditions in which subjects restudied material or took a test without feedback. Open-book testing led to better initial performance than closed-book testing, but this benefit did not persist and both types of testing produced equivalent retention on a delayed test. Subjects predicted they would recall more after repeated studying, even though testing enhanced long-term retention more than restudying. These experiments demonstrate that the testing effect occurs with both open- and closed-book tests, and that subjects fail to predict the effectiveness of testing relative to studying in enhancing later recall.

  abstract      = {A TOTAL deficiency in or resistance to the protein leptin causes severe obesity1–4. As leptin levels rise with increasing adiposity in rodents5 and man6,7, it is proposed to act as a negative feedback 'adipostatic signal' to brain centres controlling energy homeostasis, limiting obesity in times of nutritional abundance1,3. Starvation is also a threat to homeostasis that triggers adaptive responses8–12, but whether leptin plays a role in the physiology of starvation is unknown. Leptin concentration falls during starvation13 and totally leptin-deficient ob/ob mice have neuroendocrine abnormalities similar to those of starvation14, suggesting that this may be the case. Here we show that preventing the starvation-induced fall in leptin with exogenous leptin substantially blunts the changes in gonadal, adrenal and thyroid axes in male mice, and prevents the starvation-induced delay in ovulation in female mice. In contrast, leptin repletion during this period of starvation has little or no effect on body weight, blood glucose or ketones. We propose that regulation of the neuroendocrine system during starvation could be the main physiological role of leptin.},

In a balanced design, 16 men completed a strenuous self-paced mountainous hill walk over 21 km, under either a low-energy (2.6 MJ; 616 kcal) intake (LEI) or high-energy (12.7 MJ; 3,019 kcal) intake (HEI) condition. During the hill walk, rectal temperatures were measured continuously, and blood samples for the analysis of metabolites and hormones were drawn before breakfast and immediately after the walk. Subjects also completed a battery of performance tests that included muscular strength, reaction times, flexibility, balance, and kinesthetic differentiation tests. During the LEI, mean blood glucose concentrations leveled off at the low-middle range of normoglycemia, whereas, on the HEI, they were significantly elevated compared with the LEI. The maintained blood glucose concentrations, during the LEI, were probably mediated via the marked fat mobilization, reflected by a two- to fivefold increase in nonesterified fatty acids, 3-hydroxybutyrate, and glycerol concentrations. The LEI group showed significantly slower one- and two-finger reaction time, had an impaired ability to balance, and were compromised in their ability to maintain body temperature, when compared with the HEI group. The modestly impaired performance (particularly with respect to balance) and thermoregulation during the LEI condition may increase susceptibly to both fatigue and injury during the pursuit of recreational activity outdoors. },

Data incorporated: Almost all published studies testing for genetic benefits from 1980 onwards (121 papers, 55 species). Analysis methods: Collected key features and findings of each study in a database. Determined overall level of support for both good genes and compatible genes hypotheses. Conducted a formal meta-analysis on a subset of studies asking the following questions: (1) Do extra-pair mates of females have different phenotypes than their within-pair mates? (2) Do extra-pair offspring differ in viability from within-pair offspring? (3) Is there a correlation between the genetic similarity of a social pair and the incidence of extra-pair paternity? Results: Both the good genes and compatible genes hypotheses failed to be supported in more than half of the species studied. The meta-analysis shows that extra-pair males are on average larger and older than within-pair males, but not different in terms of secondary sexual traits, condition or relatedness to the female. No difference was found between extra-pair and within- pair young in survival to the next breeding season. We found no significant correlation between pair genetic similarity and extra-pair paternity. Conclusions: Genetic benefits are not strongly supported by available empirical data. New hypotheses are needed. Keywords: compatible genes, direct benefits, extra-pair paternity, good genes, meta-analysis.},

Increased locomotor speed in head-fixed mice drove earlier onset of learning and trial-by-trial enhancement of learned responses that were dissociable from changes in arousal and independent of sensory modality. Eyelid responses evoked by optogenetic stimulation of mossy fiber inputs to the cerebellum, but not at sites downstream, were positively modulated by ongoing locomotion. Substituting prolonged, low-intensity optogenetic mossy fiber stimulation for locomotion was sufficient to enhance conditioned responses. Our results suggest that locomotor activity modulates delay eyeblink conditioning through increased activation of the mossy fiber pathway within the cerebellum. Taken together, these results provide evidence for a novel role for behavioral state modulation in associative learning and suggest a potential mechanism through which engaging in movement can improve an individualâs ability to learn.},

Sammanfattat

Maratonsporter ut{\"{o}}vas av allt fler, inte bara elitidrottare utan ocks{\r{a}} normaltränade.

Det finns en utbredd uppfattning om att det är hälsosamt att dricka rikligt i samband med ut{\"{o}}vande av fysisk aktivitet. Detta kan leda till vätskebalansrubbningar i form av vatten{\"{o}}verskott och hyponatremi.

Här beskrivs tv{\r{a}} fall av hyponatremi med grav CNS-p{\r{a}}verkan i samband med ett maratonspinningpass. Bägge fallen v{\r{a}}rdades p{\r{a}} intensivv{\r{a}}rdsavdelning.

Etiologin bakom akut p{\r{a}}kommen ansträngningsutl{\"{o}}st hyponatremi diskuteras samt hur man kan behandla och undvika tillst{\r{a}}ndet.

Den enklaste strategin är att begränsa v{\"{a}}tskeintaget under fysisk ut{\"{o}}vning i enlighet med kroppens egna signaler (t{\"{o}}rst).

o Hyponatremi till f{\"{o}}ljd av {\"{o}}kat v{\"{a}}tskeintag i samband med fysisk anstr{\"{a}}ngning beskrevs i b{\"{o}}rjan av 1980-talet [1-3]. Fram till slutet av 1960-talet uppmanades extremsportut{\"{o}}vare att undvika dryck i samband med fysisk anstr{\"{a}}ngning, delvis p{\r{a}} grund av gastrointestinala st{\"{o}}rningar [1]. Maratonl{\"{o}}pare avslutade ofta sina lopp med viss viktnedg{\r{a}}ng, men utan n{\r{a}}gra st{\"{o}}rre allvarliga medicinska komplikationer. Avvikelser i natrium- och v{\"{a}}tskebalansen var, i de fall den kontrollerades, f{\"{o}}rh{\"{o}}jda natriumniv{\r{a}}er med varierande grad av s{\"{a}}nkt plasmavolym [2]. P{\r{a}} 1970-talet uppmanades maratonl{\"{o}}pare att ers{\"{a}}tta v{\"{a}}tskef{\"{o}}rluster, d{\r{a}} man trodde att dehydrering ledde till v{\"{a}}rmeslag och potentiell kollaps. Man fokuserade p{\r{a}} kroppstemperaturen och graden av dehydrering och s{\r{a}}g ett samband d{\"{a}}remellan [4, 5].
Sedan 1985 har ett flertal rapporter publicerats om tr{\"{a}}ningsutl{\"{o}}st hyponatremi i samband med maratonsporter, sk exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) [2,4]. Med den {\"{o}}kade ut{\"{o}}vningen av maratonsporter tillsammans med den allm{\"{a}}nna uppfattningen om vikten av att ers{\"{a}}tta v{\"{a}}tskef{\"{o}}rluster, ofta med natriumfattiga v{\"{a}}tskor, {\"{a}}r hyponatremi den vanligaste f{\"{o}}rekommande elektrolytrubbningen vid extremsporter [3, 4, 6, 7]. Hyponatremi f{\"{o}}rekommer i en frekvens av 10–30 procent i samband med uth{\r{a}}llighetssporter i olika unders{\"{o}}kningar [3, 5, 6, 7].


Fallen

Fall 1 var en 18-{\r{a}}rig gymnasiestuderande kvinna som deltog i ett organiserat maratonspinningpass p{\r{a}} ett gym. Kvinnan var tidigare v{\"{a}}sentligen frisk, vegetarian och hade ett BMI p{\r{a}} 27. Spinningpasset p{\r{a}}gick i 4,5 timmar. Under passet hade deltagarna tillg{\r{a}}ng till vatten, bl{\r{a}}b{\"{a}}rssoppa, hasseln{\"{o}}tter, s{\"{o}}tmandlar, m{\"{o}}rk blockchoklad, bananer och russin. Enligt egen uppgift drack kvinnan 8–10 liter vatten under passet. Kv{\"{a}}llen innan hade hon {\"{a}}tit pasta och p{\r{a}} morgonen gr{\"{o}}tfrukost.

I samband med stretchning efter spinningpasset svimmade kvinnan, hon vaknade d{\"{a}}refter till och fick skjuts hem. Efter hemkomsten blev hon illam{\r{a}}ende och kr{\"{a}}ktes ett flertal g{\r{a}}nger. Hon svimmade ytterligare en g{\r{a}}ng hemma och s{\"{o}}kte d{\"{a}}refter akut. Vid ankomsten till akutmottagningen var hon blek och kallsvettig och svarade tr{\"{o}}gt p{\r{a}} tilltal.

I status noterades liksidig pupillreaktion och positiv Babinski bilateralt. Patienten var tidvis somnolent alternativt agiterad. EKG visade sinusrytm med en hj{\"{a}}rtfrekvens p{\r{a}} 60/min. Blodtrycket var 130/80 mm Hg. Auskultation av hj{\"{a}}rta och lungor var utan anm{\"{a}}rkning. Laboratorieproven visade kalium 3,2 mmol/l, natrium 122 mmol/l, albumin 34 g/l och totalkalcium 1,88 mmol/l. F{\"{o}}rutom l{\"{a}}tt leukocytos var {\"{o}}vriga prov v{\"{a}}sentligen utan anm{\"{a}}rkning. DT-unders{\"{o}}kning av hj{\"{a}}rnan visade tecken p{\r{a}} hj{\"{a}}rn{\"{o}}dem.

Behandling inleddes p{\r{a}} akutmottagningen med betametason (Betapred) och ett natriumkloriddropp med tillsats av 160 mmol natrium, som gick in p{\r{a}} sammanlagt {\r{a}}tta timmar. Patienten lades in p{\r{a}} intensivv{\r{a}}rdsavdelning (IVA) f{\"{o}}r fortsatt korrigering av hyponatremin, d{\"{a}}r hon erh{\"{o}}ll ytterligare en liter natriumklorid och v{\"{a}}tskedrivande (furosemid). P{\r{a}} grund av agitation erh{\"{o}}ll hon propofolinfusion under natten. Tillst{\r{a}}ndet f{\"{o}}rb{\"{a}}ttrades, och hon skrevs ut fr{\r{a}}n IVA dagen efter och skrevs ut hem ytterligare en dag senare. Utskrivningsdagen var serumnatrium 137 mmol/l. Hon hade under sjukhusvistelsen erh{\r{a}}llit sammanlagt 468 mmol natrium under ett dygn.

Fall 2 var en tidigare v{\"{a}}sentligen frisk kvinna i 50-{\r{a}}rs{\r{a}}ldern som regelbundet tr{\"{a}}nar spinning och som deltog i samma maratonspinningpass som kvinnan i Fall 1. Kvinnan {\r{a}}t inga mediciner, f{\"{o}}rutom Levaxin 150 mikrogram x 1. Under passet fick hon huvudv{\"{a}}rk, blev illam{\r{a}}ende och upplevde svimningsk{\"{a}}nsla men fortsatte tr{\"{a}}ningen. P{\r{a}} grund av yrsel fick hon l{\"{a}}gga sig. Ambulans tillkallades. Hon skakade, hade huvudv{\"{a}}rk och kr{\"{a}}ktes under transporten till sjukhuset, d{\"{a}}r hon uppgav att hon druckit sportdryck under tr{\"{a}}ningspasset.

Vid ankomsten till akutmottagningen (p{\r{a}} ett annat sjukhus {\"{a}}n i Fall 1) k{\"{a}}nde hon sig lite b{\"{a}}ttre. I status vid ankomsten noterades inget anm{\"{a}}rkningsv{\"{a}}rt med avseende p{\r{a}} hj{\"{a}}rta, buk och lungor. Hon hade sinusrytm med en hj{\"{a}}rtfrekvens p{\r{a}} 75/min och ett blodtryck p{\r{a}} 120/70 mm Hg. Hon var vaken men l{\"{a}}tt motoriskt orolig. P{\r{a}} grund av misstanke om hyponatremi gavs efter provtagning en liter natriumklorid i snabb takt. Patienten blev initialt piggare men b{\"{o}}rjade efter ett tag krampa med fecesavg{\r{a}}ng p{\r{a}} akutmottagningen. I samband med detta kr{\"{a}}ktes hon igen. N{\"{a}}r provsvaren kom visade dessa ett serumnatrium p{\r{a}} 118 mmol/l och ett serumkalium 3,4 mmol/l. {\"{O}}vriga prov var v{\"{a}}sentligen utan anm{\"{a}}rkning.

Behandling inleddes med infusion av natriumklorid med tillsats av 120 mmol natrium, och patienten {\"{o}}verf{\"{o}}rdes till IVA. D{\"{a}}r blev patienten okontaktbar och kastade sig av och an i s{\"{a}}ngen. P{\r{a}} grund av detta s{\"{o}}vdes patienten och intuberades. Misstanke om aspiration i samband med krampanfallet och kr{\"{a}}kningen bekr{\"{a}}ftades med lungr{\"{o}}ntgen. DT-skalle gjordes akut och var utan anm{\"{a}}rkning. Lumbalpunktion visade klar v{\"{a}}tska och ett likvortryck p{\r{a}} 17 mm Hg (normalt {\"{a}}r 20 mm Hg). Patienten erh{\"{o}}ll hydrokortison (Solu-Cortef), furosemid, cefuroxim och sederades med propofol {\"{o}}ver natten.

Vid intagningen till IVA hade patienten sm{\r{a}} pupiller som reagerade f{\"{o}}r ljus, bilateralt tveksam Babinski och nedsatta reflexer. Det noterades ocks{\r{a}} att kvinnan var {\"{o}}demat{\"{o}}s i armar och h{\"{a}}nder. P{\r{a}}f{\"{o}}ljande dag kunde patienten extuberas. Hon var d{\r{a}} fortfarande l{\"{a}}tt f{\"{o}}rvirrad och motoriskt orolig. Hon f{\"{o}}rb{\"{a}}ttrades och kunde {\"{o}}verf{\"{o}}ras till v{\r{a}}rdavdelning efter tv{\r{a}} dygns IVA-v{\r{a}}rd. Efter ytterligare ett dygn p{\r{a}} v{\r{a}}rdavdelning skrevs patienten ut i gott skick. Vid utskrivningen hade serumnatrium stigit till 138 mmol/l. Hon hade under sitt f{\"{o}}rsta IVA-dygn erh{\r{a}}llit sammanlagt 428 mmol natrium.


Diskussion

Hyponatremi definieras som serumnatrium under 135 mmol/l [2]. Natriumniv{\r{a}}er p{\r{a}} 130–134 mmol/l uppvisar s{\"{a}}llan symtom [2, 3]. Symtom p{\r{a}} EAH uppkommer f{\"{o}}rst vid l{\"{a}}gre natriumniv{\r{a}}er. Tidiga symtom {\"{a}}r illam{\r{a}}ende, tr{\"{o}}tthet, ospecifik sjukdomsk{\"{a}}nsla, {\"{o}}dem och muskelsvaghet. Vid plasmaniv{\r{a}}er under 125 mmol/l ser man i st{\"{o}}rre omfattning symtom p{\r{a}} cerebral p{\r{a}}verkan i form av desorientering, f{\"{o}}rvirring, okoordinerade r{\"{o}}relser, kr{\"{a}}kningar, afasi och sl{\"{o}}het [4, 6]. Detta betecknas i en del litteratur exercise-associated hyponatremic encephalopathy (EAHE) [8]. De mentala symtomen beror p{\r{a}} hj{\"{a}}rn{\"{o}}dem, som utvecklas vid sv{\r{a}}r hyponatremi.

Symtomen vid grav hyponatremi {\"{a}}r kramper, koma och lung{\"{o}}dem, men {\"{a}}ven hj{\"{a}}rtstillest{\r{a}}nd och total hj{\"{a}}rninfarkt kan f{\"{o}}rekomma vid de allvarligaste formerna [4, 6]. Mellan 1997 och 2005 rapporterades det minst ett d{\"{o}}dsfall {\r{a}}rligen till f{\"{o}}ljd av EAHE i USA [8].


Etiologi

Etiologin till EAH f{\"{o}}rklaras till st{\"{o}}rsta delen av den {\"{o}}verv{\"{a}}tskning som {\"{a}}ger rum vid maraton och andra uth{\r{a}}llighetssporter d{\r{a}} deltagare dricker mer v{\"{a}}tska {\"{a}}n vad kroppen g{\"{o}}r sig av med via svettning och diures [9]. Det har gjorts f{\"{o}}rs{\"{o}}k att f{\"{o}}rklara EAH med f{\"{o}}rh{\"{o}}jda saltf{\"{o}}rluster via svettning, men inga bevis har lagts fram f{\"{o}}r att de som utvecklar EAH vid maratonidrotter skulle ha mer saltinneh{\r{a}}llande svett {\"{a}}n de som inte utvecklar EAH [7]. M{\"{o}}jligtvis kan saltf{\"{o}}rluster f{\"{o}}rv{\"{a}}rra en redan etablerad hyponatremi.

Man har dock sett att individer som {\"{a}}r acklimatiserade till varma klimat har mindre saltm{\"{a}}ngder i sin svett {\"{a}}n icke-acklimatiserade [6]. Hyponatremin kan ocks{\r{a}} f{\"{o}}rv{\"{a}}rras genom vasopressinp{\r{a}}slag vid fysisk aktivitet [4]. Minskad diures ger {\"{o}}kad v{\"{a}}tskeretention och d{\"{a}}rigenom {\"{o}}dem och vikt{\"{o}}kning. Svettning kan ocks{\r{a}} f{\"{o}}rst{\"{a}}rka vasopressinp{\r{a}}slaget och f{\"{o}}rv{\"{a}}rra graden av hyponatremi [2], vilket ytterligare p{\r{a}}verkar {\"{o}}verv{\"{a}}tskningen.

Redistribution av plasmavolymen till muskler f{\"{o}}rst{\"{a}}rker vasopressinp{\r{a}}slaget, och n{\"{a}}r plasmavolymerna {\r{a}}terg{\r{a}}r till det centrala rummet {\"{o}}kar uts{\"{o}}ndringen av natriuretisk f{\"{o}}rmakspeptid (ANP), som tillsammans med vasopressinet i sin tur ger en natriures. Detta kan f{\"{o}}rst{\"{a}}rka hyponatremin ytterligare efter avslutad fysisk aktivitet [4]. Efter avslutad fysisk aktivitet {\"{o}}kar {\"{a}}ven blodfl{\"{o}}det gastrointestinalt, vilket ger ett {\"{o}}kat upptag av v{\"{a}}tska fr{\r{a}}n gastrointestinalkanalen. Det i sin tur s{\"{a}}nker ytterligare natriumniv{\r{a}}n i plasma [9].

Symtomatisk EAH {\"{a}}r starkt f{\"{o}}rknippad med viktuppg{\r{a}}ng [7]. En viktuppg{\r{a}}ng p{\r{a}} 0 procent eller mer betraktas som {\"{o}}verv{\"{a}}tskning. En viktf{\"{o}}r{\"{a}}ndring p{\r{a}} –0,01 till –3,0 procent r{\"{a}}knas som euvolemi, och en viktnedg{\r{a}}ng p{\r{a}} mer {\"{a}}n 3 procent r{\"{a}}knas som dehydrering. Den st{\"{o}}rsta korrelationen mellan vikt{\"{o}}kning och hyponatremi finns hos individer med natriumniv{\r{a}}er under 129 mmol/l. Bland de som {\"{o}}kar sin vikt med 4,5 procent riskerar n{\"{a}}stan varannan att utveckla EAHE [6, 8].


Riskfaktorer

Riskfaktorer f{\"{o}}r att utveckla EAH {\"{a}}r som tidigare n{\"{a}}mnts intag av stora m{\"{a}}ngder v{\"{a}}tska.

Intag av NSAID {\"{o}}kar ocks{\r{a}} risken f{\"{o}}r EAH [3], och EAH tycks vara vanligare bland kvinnor {\"{a}}n bland m{\"{a}}n, m{\"{o}}jligtvis beroende p{\r{a}} l{\"{a}}gre kroppsvolym i f{\"{o}}rh{\r{a}}llande till det stora v{\"{a}}tskeintaget [11].

Behandling

EAH behandlas endast vid symtom. I Sydafrika h{\"{o}}lls {\r{a}}r 2005 det f{\"{o}}rsta internationella konsensusm{\"{o}}tet om EAH, och man enades om att sv{\r{a}}r EAH, dvs EAHE, ska behandlas s{\r{a}} tidigt som m{\"{o}}jligt med 100 ml 3-procentig NaCl (513 mmol/l) eller med 1 ml/kg p{\r{a}} 10 min. Detta ber{\"{a}}knas h{\"{o}}ja natriumhalten med 2–4 mmol/l och minskar risken f{\"{o}}r hj{\"{a}}rn{\"{o}}dem [10].

Fortsatt behandling sker genom att iterera ovanst{\r{a}}ende v{\"{a}}tskeregim varje timme eller starta infusion av 3-procentig NaCl med 1–2 ml/kg/h tills patienten {\r{a}}terf{\r{a}}r medvetande [2]. Akut p{\r{a}}kommen hyponatremi till f{\"{o}}ljd av akut {\"{o}}verv{\"{a}}tskning kan h{\"{o}}jas med 1–2 mmol/h [12, 13].

Summary

Hyponatremia due to increased fluid intake was first described in the early 1980s. This article describes two females who participated in a marathon spinning event. The first case describes an 18-year-old healthy woman. During the spinning event she drank close to 8 litres of water. Afterwards she fainted twice and came to the emergency room (ER). In the ER she was disorientated, drowsy and on and off agitated. On admission she showed no abnormalities regarding her physiological status besides a blood analysis that revealed a hyponatremia of 122 mmol/l. A CT-scan showed cerebral oedema. She was treated with an intravenous infusion of isotonic saline 0.9 % with additional sodium and stayed overnight in the ICU. Her condition improved and she could leave the ICU after 24 hours. Her sodium had increased to137 mmol/l when she left the hospital two days after being admitted. The second case describes a woman in her early 50s who also participated in the same marathon spinning event. She was healthy and exercised regularly. She reported drinking sports drinks during the marathon spinning. During the event she became nauseous and felt faint. An ambulance transported her to the ER where she vomited and had seizures. She was agitated and mentally confused. Neither did she show any other physiological abnormalities except a sodium level of 118mmol/l. She was treated with saline 0.9 % with additional sodium and spent two days in the ICU. As she left the hospital a day later her sodium levels had risen to 138 mmol/l.

Exercise Associated Hyponatremia is a serious medical condition which has increased during the last twenty years as prolonged endurance activities are becoming more and more common. There is also an overall incorrect assumption that athletes should drink as much as possible to replace the fluids that are lost during exercise. Several studies show that this is not the case - on the contrary - after completing a marathon or other prolonged endurance activities a slight weight loss is considered a sign of euhydration. More information and updated recommendations to organizers and participants of endurance sports is needed to avoid future cases as the ones described above.

  abstract      = {Ring species provide particularly clear demonstrations of how one species can gradually evolve into two, but are rare in nature1, 2, 3. In the greenish warbler (Phylloscopus trochiloides) species complex, a ring of populations wraps around Tibet. Two reproductively isolated forms co-exist in central Siberia, with a gradient of genetic and phenotypic characteristics through the southern chain of populations connecting them4, 5, 6. Previous genetic evidence has proven inconclusive, however, regarding whether species divergence took place in the face of continuous gene flow and whether hybridization between the terminal forms of the ring ever occurred7, 8, 9. Here we use genome-wide analyses to show that, although spatial patterns of genetic variation are currently mostly as expected of a ring species, historical breaks in gene flow have existed at more than one location around the ring, and the two Siberian forms have occasionally interbred. Substantial periods of geographical isolation occurred not only in the north but also in the western Himalayas, where there is now an extensive hybrid zone between genetically divergent forms. Limited asymmetric introgression has occurred directly between the Siberian forms, although it has not caused a blending of those forms, suggesting selection against introgressed genes in the novel genetic background. Levels of reproductive isolation and genetic introgression are consistent with levels of phenotypic divergence around the ring, with phenotypic similarity and extensive interbreeding across the southwestern contact zone and strong phenotypic divergence and nearly complete reproductive isolation across the northern contact zone. These results cast doubt on the hypothesis that the greenish warbler should be viewed as a rare example of speciation by distance6, but demonstrate that the greenish warbler displays a continuum from slightly divergent neighbouring populations to almost fully reproductively isolated species.},

  abstract      = {To achieve the required generality, models designed to predict scaling relationships for diverse groups of animals generally need to be simple. An argument based on considerations of dynamic similarity predicts correctly that the mechanical cost of transport for running [power/(body mass x speed)] will be independent of body mass; but measurements of oxygen consumption for running birds and mammals show that the metabolic cost of transport is proportional to (body mass)-0.32. Thus the leg muscles seem to work more efficiently in larger animals. A model that treats birds as fixed wing aircraft predicts that the mechanical power required for flight at the maximum range speed will be proportional to (body mass)1.02, but the metabolic power is found to be proportional to (body mass)0.83; again, larger animals seem to have more efficient muscles. A model that treats hovering hummingbirds and insects as helicopters predicts mechanical power to be approximately proportional to body mass, but measurements of oxygen consumption once again show efficiency increasing with body mass. A model of swimming fish as rigid submarines predicts power to be proportional to (body mass)0.5x(speed)2.5 or to (body mass)0.6x(speed)2.8, depending on whether flow in the boundary layer is laminar or turbulent. Unfortunately, this prediction cannot easily be compared with available compilations of metabolic data. The finding that efficiency seems to increase with body mass, at least in running and flight, is discussed in relation to the metabolic energy costs of muscular work and force.},

  abstract      = {Author Summary The global burden of cholera is largely unknown because the majority of cases are not reported. The low reporting can be attributed to limited capacity of epidemiological surveillance and laboratories, as well as social, political, and economic disincentives for reporting. We previously estimated 2.8 million cases and 91,000 deaths annually due to cholera in 51 endemic countries. A major limitation in our previous estimate was that the endemic and non-endemic countries were defined based on the countriesâ reported cholera cases. If a country did not report cases even though the country had cholera, the country was classified as cholera free. This time we addressed this limitation by using a spatial modelling technique, which helped us define the cholera-endemic countries based on access to improved water and sanitation in the country as well as cholera incidence in neighboring countries. Our new estimate illustrates 2.9 million of cases and 95,000 deaths in 69 endemic countries, with the majority of the burden in Sub-Saharan Africa. The sustained high burden of cholera points to the necessity for integrated and improved control efforts, and these findings may help programmatic decision-making for controlling the disease in endemic countries.},

In part, this refects both the processes used to produce the finished product and the currently accepted standards for the technical quality of raw materials. Nevertheless there are a number of potential hazards, which, if incorrectly managed, pose a significant threat to consumer health. These hazards can be either chemical or microbiological in origin and arise at specific points in the production and supply of grain as well as in the eventual manufacture of the food eaten by the consumer. Once identified, these hazards can be managed and the threat to the consumer minimised. This is achieved through application of quality assurance principles using Good Manufacturing/Agricultural Practice and Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) techniques based on a sound knowledge on the origins and occurrence of the hazards concerned. },

Hunger strike is described as voluntary refusal of food and/or fluids. Prolonged starvation may produce many adverse events including even death in rare circumstances. Here, we present three fatal cases (all males, 25–38 years) died from hunger strike. In all corpses, obvious muscle wasting with reduced subcutaneous and internal fat deposits, and atrophy in some organs were demonstrated at autopsy. The extraordinary long starvation period before death could presumably be linked to the thiamine uptake in this period, which had been discontinued by all subjects before the death occurred. Prolonged caloric deficiency with subsequent complications such as multiple organ failure, severe sepsis and ventricular fibrillation could account as major causes of death in these subjects. The competence of the physicians working with hunger strikers about the processes and potential problems is of great importance since they have to acknowledge about them to their patients.},

The diverse assortment of codon reassignments present in subcellular organelles and organisms of distinct lineages has 'thawed' the concept of a universal immutable code; it may not be accidental that out of more than 140 amino acids found in natural proteins, only two (selenocysteine and pyrrolysine) are known to have been added to the standard 20-member amino acid alphabet.

  abstract      = {The “Weak Garden of Eden” model for the origin and dispersal of modern humans (Harpendinget al., 1993) posits that modern humans spread into separate regions from a restricted source, around 100 ka (thousand years ago), then passed through population bottlenecks. Around 50 ka, dramatic growth occurred within dispersed populations that were genetically isolated from each other. Population growth began earliest in Africa and later in Eurasia and is hypothesized to have been caused by the invention and spread of a more efficient Later Stone Age/Upper Paleolithic technology, which developed in equatorial Africa.
Climatic and geological evidence suggest an alternative hypothesis for Late Pleistocene population bottlenecks and releases. The last glacial period was preceded by one thousand years of the coldest temperatures of the Later Pleistocene (∼71–70 ka), apparently caused by the eruption of Toba, Sumatra. Toba was the largest known explosive eruption of the Quaternary. Toba's volcanic winter could have decimated most modern human populations, especially outside of isolated tropical refugia. Release from the bottleneck could have occurred either at the end of this hypercold phase, or 10,000 years later, at the transition from cold oxygen isotope stage 4 to warmer stage 3. The largest populations surviving through the bottleneck should have been found in the largest tropical refugia, and thus in equatorial Africa. High genetic diversity in modern Africans may thus reflect a less severe bottleneck rather than earlier population growth.
Volcanic winter may have reduced populations to levels low enough for founder effects, genetic drift and local adaptations to produce rapid population differentiation. If Toba caused the bottlenecks, then modern human races may have differentiated abruptly, only 70 thousand years ago.

evaluated the effect of a sleep high–train low regimen on the finger cold-induced vasodilation (CIVD) response.
Seventeen healthy males were assigned to either a control (CON; n = 9) or experimental (EXP; n = 8) group. Each
group participated in a 28-day aerobic training program of daily 1-h exercise (50% of peak power output).
During the training period, the EXP group slept at a simulated altitude of 2800 meters (week 1) to 3400 m (week
4) above sea level. Normoxic (CIVD NOR ; CON and EXP groups) and hypoxic (CIVD HYPO ; F I O 2 = 0.12; EXP group
only) CIVD characteristics were assessed before and after the training period during a 30-min immersion of the
hand in 8!C water. After the intervention, the EXP group had increased average finger skin temperature
(CIVD NOR : + 0.5!C; CIVD HYPO : + 0.5!C), number of waves (CIVD NOR : + 0.5; CIVD HYPO : + 0.6), and CIVD
amplitude (CIVD NOR : + 1.5!C; CIVD HYPO : + 3!C) in both CIVD tests ( p < 0.05). In contrast, the CON group had
an increase in only the CIVD amplitude ( + 0.5!C; p < 0.05). Thus, the enhancement of aerobic performance

  abstract      = {Curcumin, a polyphenolic compound derived from dietary spice turmeric, possesses diverse pharmacologic effects including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiproliferative and antiangiogenic activities. Phase I clinical trials have shown that curcumin is safe even at high doses (12 g/day) in humans but exhibit poor bioavailability. Major reasons contributing to the low plasma and tissue levels of curcumin appear to be due to poor absorption, rapid metabolism, and rapid systemic elimination. To improve the bioavailability of curcumin, numerous approaches have been undertaken. These approaches involve, first, the use of adjuvant like piperine that interferes with glucuronidation; second, the use of liposomal curcumin; third, curcumin nanoparticles; fourth, the use of curcumin phospholipid complex; and fifth, the use of structural analogues of curcumin (e.g., EF-24). The latter has been reported to have a rapid absorption with a peak plasma half-life. Despite the lower bioavailability, therapeutic efficacy of curcumin against various human diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, arthritis, neurological diseases and Crohnʼs disease, has been documented. Enhanced bioavailability of curcumin in the near future is likely to bring this promising natural product to the forefront of therapeutic agents for treatment of human disease.},

  abstract      = {In this paper, we review research on how studentsâ interest in science changes through the primary to secondary school transition. In the literature, the findings generally show that primary students enjoy science but come to lose interest during secondary school. As this claim is based mainly on interview and questionnaire data, that is on secondary reports from students about their interest in science, these results are reexamined through our own extensive material from primary and secondary school on how interest is constituted through classroom discourse. Our results suggest the possibility that primary students do not lose their interest in science, but rather that an interest in science is never constituted. The overview indicates that studies relying on interviews and questionnaires make it difficult to ascertain what the actual object of interest is when students act in the science classroom. The possibility suggested should, if valid, have consequences for science education and be worthy of further examination.},

As compared with unacclimatized white men they showed a greater ability to endure the cold night. In general the Lapps slept well without visible shivering, whereas the controls were prevented from sleeping by the sensations of cold and vigorous shivering. The metabolic rates of the Lapps were close to their basal level, in contrast to the raised metabolism of the unacclimatized control subjects. Some of the Lapps maintained slightly higher peripheral skin temperatures than the control subjects, but had a much greater fall in their rectal temperatures, indicating a greater loss of stored body heat.},

Fasting for 48 hr produced an abnormal GTT that progressed in severity as fasts were prolonged to 72 and 96 hr. During fasting, a significant diurnal variation was observed for plasma free fatty acids and phosphate but not for plasma glucose, sodium, potassium, calcium, or chloride.

During refeeding over a 6-day period, the GTT was significantly abnormal on day 1 but not on day 2 or 3. On days 4 to 6, a significant deterioration in the GTT was observed for each of the subjects studied. During the 5th day of refeeding a significant natriuresis developed, which was accompanied by a significant increase in urine volume and reduction in water intake. Thus, the deterioration of the GTT during refeeding occurred concomitantly with a marked alteration in body fluid and electrolyte balance.

Our studies demonstrate that a 500-kcal diet containing 85 g sucrose/day maintains a normal GTT in normal subjects over a 10-day period of study. Other studies indicate, however, that a low carbohydrate diet may lead to deterioration of the GTT in patients with alterations of carbohydrate homeostasis.},

Because of the lack of a controlled double-blind trial we started our own investigations to confirm this hypothesis in L-5-HTP. In 1972 we performed two open dose finding trials with L-5-HTP in combination with Benzerazide. These open studies were followed by a double-blind trial comparing L-5-HTP in combination with Benzerazide to Imipramine in 30 patients. Assessments were carried out on day 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20. For data collection we used the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, the AMP-system, a Global Rating Scale of Severity of Depression and a Brief Rating Scale for the Behaviour on the ward. In this article we report only a part of the results, mainly on the findings with the AMP-system and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. During our double-blind trial we could not find any significant difference in efficacy of L-5-HTP and Imipramine. The same was found in an open trial. Furthermore the L-5-HTP results showed no difference compared with the results of an Imipramine treatment in 40 patients in earlier double-blind studies. L-5-HTP and Imipramine caused different patterns of side effects. L-5- HTP caused mainly gastrointestinal side effects and Imipramine caused mainly dryness of the mouth and tremor. The gastrointestinal side effects caused by L-5-HTP seemed to be dose dependent.},

  abstract      = {Intermittent energy restriction (IER) has become the subject of considerable scientific interest as a potential dietary approach for weight-loss and improving cardiometabolic health. This approach involves intermittent periods of total or partial energy restriction (ER) alternated with non-restricted intake, and has been studied in rodent and human populations. This review aims to provide an overview of the IER literature to date, with a specific focus on its effects on cardiometabolic health indices in rodents and humans. Current evidence from studies in rodents and humans suggests that IER is capable of promoting weight-loss and/or favourably influencing an array of cardiometabolic health indices, with equal or greater efficacy than conventional continuous ER approaches. Putative mechanisms include the effects of IER on adipose tissue physiology, stress resistance and fat distribution within visceral and intra-hepatic sites. However, a large proportion of this mechanistic evidence is limited to indirect observations and/or has come from rodent studies requiring translation into humans. Furthermore, whilst there is some indication that total IER and the array of partial IER protocols which have been developed may elicit distinct biological effects, our knowledge around this is limited as only a small number of rodent studies have directly addressed this. Ultimately, whilst much remains to be learned about IER, including its mechanisms of action and long-term efficacy, the positive findings to date serve to highlight promising avenues for future research.},

Acute, subchronic, and chronic dermal exposures were examined. No-observed-effect-levels (NOELs) of 200, 300, and 100mg/kg body weight (BW) were used as endpoints for DEET for acute, subchronic, and chronic exposures, respectively. For picaridin, a NOEL of 2000mg/kg BW/day for acute exposure and a NOEL of 200mg/kg BW/day for subchronic and chronic exposures were used. Daily exposures to several population subgroups were estimated. Risks were characterized using the Margin of Exposure (MOE) method (NOEL divided by the estimated exposure), whereby estimated MOEs were compared to an MOE of 100. Estimates of daily exposures ranged from 2 to 59mg/kg BW/day for DEET and 2 to 22mg/kg BW/day for picaridin. Children had the lowest MOEs. However, none of the estimated exposures exceeded NOELs for either repellent. At 40% DEET for acute exposure, children â©½12 years had MOEs below 100. For subchronic and chronic exposures children at â©¾25% DEET and at 15% picaridin had MOEs below 100. Therefore, we found no significant toxicological risks from typical usage of these topical insect repellents.},

Quebrada Camarones, in the Atacama Desert, has the highest arsenic levels in the Americas (>1,000 Âµg/L). However, the Camarones people have subsisted in this adverse environment during the last 7,000 years and have not presented any epidemiological emergencies. Therefore, to solve this conundrum we compared the frequencies of four protective genetic variants of the AS3MT gene associated with efficient arsenic metabolization, between the living populations of Camarones and two other populations historically exposed to lower levels of arsenic.

Materials and Methods
The Chilean selected population samples come from Quebrada Camarones (n = 50) and the Azapa Valley (n = 47) in the north and San Juan de la Costa (n = 45) in southern Chile. The genotyping was conducted using PCR-RFLP. We compared the genotypic and allelic frequencies, and estimated the haplotype frequencies in the AS3MT gene.

Results
We found higher frequencies of the protective variants in those people from Camarones than in the other two populations. The haplotype estimation showed that the combination of protective variants of CTTA is very frequent in Camarones (68%) and Azapa (48%), but extremely low in San Juan de la Costa (8%). Also, the C variant associated with toxicity risks in the SNP Met287Thr had a lower frequency in Camarones (1%) and is higher in the other populations.

Discussion
The higher frequency of protective variants in both northern Chilean populations indicates a long exposure to naturally arsenic-contaminated water sources. Our data suggest that a high arsenic metabolization capacity has been selected as an adaptive mechanism in these populations in order to survive in an arsenic-laden environment.},

The ratio between the length of the second and the length of the fourth digit (2D:4D) is sexually dimorphic such that males of many species possess a lower ratio than females, particularly in the right hand. Still, men and women often exhibit overlapping 2D:4D ranges and the ratio is highly variable between populations. In order to further explore populational variability, we chose to analyze 2D:4D in the Hadza, a population of hunter-gatherers living in Tanzania.

Materials and Methods
Data were collected separately by two researchers over the course of three years (1998, 2001, 2006) from 152 adult participants (male: nâ=â76, female: nâ=â76). Independent samples t-tests were used to explore sex differences, paired samples t-tests were used to explore directional effects within each sex, and linear regression and one-way ANOVA were used to test possible age effects.

Results
In none of the years, or pooled (nâ=â152), did we find evidence that adult men have a lower 2D:4D than adult women. If anything, the data suggest that women in this population have a significantly lower right hand 2D:4D than men (P < 0.001, dâ=â0.57). In contrast, left hand 2D:4D did not exhibit a sex difference (P = 0.862, dâ=â0.03).

Discussion
These findings challenge the current view that lower 2D:4D in men is a uniform characteristic of our species. Cross-populational variance in 2D:4D may be related to known patterns of hormonal variation resulting from both genetic and environmental mechanisms, though this relationship merits further investigation.

Extremely positive experiences, and positive appraisals thereof, produce intense positive emotions that often generate
both positive expressions (e.g., smiles) and expressions normatively reserved for negative emotions (e.g., tears). We
developed a definition of these dimorphous expressions and tested the proposal that their function is to regulate
emotions. We showed that individuals who express emotions in this dimorphous manner do so as a general response
across a variety of emotionally provoking situations, which suggests that these expressions are responses to intense
positive emotion rather than unique to one particular situation. We used cute stimuli (an elicitor of positive emotion) to
demonstrate both the existence of these dimorphous expressions and to provide preliminary evidence of their function
as regulators of emotion.

Ucol, Uosm, and Usg were not significantly correlated with plasma osmolality, plasma sodium, or hemato-crit. This suggested that these hematologic measurements are not as sensitive to mild hypohydration (between days) as the selected urinary indices are.

It was concluded that (a) Ucol may be used in athletic/industrial settings or field studies, where close estimates of Usg or Uosm are acceptable, but should not be utilized in laboratories where greater precision and accuracy are required, and (b) Uosm and Usg may be used interchangeably to determine hydration status. },

NYHET: 2015-12-11

Dagens medie- och policydebatter tenderar att homogenisera k{\"{o}}nen n{\"{a}}r skillnader i studieresultat mellan flickor och pojkar ska f{\"{o}}rklaras. Det menade Elisabet {\"{O}}hrn, professor vid institutionen f{\"{o}}r pedagogik och specialpedagogik, vid en f{\"{o}}rel{\"{a}}sning i serien ”En timme p{\r{a}} Pedagogen” i b{\"{o}}rjan av december.

N{\"{a}}r Elisabet {\"{O}}hrn avslutade h{\"{o}}stens popul{\"{a}}rvetenskapliga serie p{\r{a}} Pedagogen med f{\"{o}}rel{\"{a}}sningen ”Pluggisar och beg{\r{a}}vningar. Om k{\"{o}}nsskillnader i betyg och skolframg{\r{a}}ng”, handlade det just om k{\"{o}}nsskillnaderna i betyg. 
Statistiken talar ett tydligt spr{\r{a}}k d{\"{a}}r flickors betyg i {\r{a}}rskurs nio i snitt ligger omkring tio procent h{\"{o}}gre {\"{a}}n pojkars, och det i alla socialgrupper.
Elisabet {\"{O}}hrn har l{\"{a}}nge forskat om k{\"{o}}nsm{\"{o}}nster i utbildning. Bland annat var hon den som under {\r{a}}ren 2011-2013 ledde forskningsprojektet Skolprestationer och k{\"{o}}n. Om undervisning, ungdomsgrupper och lokala villkor, med st{\"{o}}d fr{\r{a}}n Vetenskapsr{\r{a}}det.

Social bakgrund viktigare
– N{\"{a}}r det i slutet av 90-talet blev medial uppst{\r{a}}ndelse {\"{o}}ver flickornas h{\"{o}}gre betyg som grupp var det dock inget nytt. S{\r{a}} var fallet redan p{\r{a}} 60-talet. Det nya {\"{a}}r att flickorna i snitt nu har h{\"{o}}gre betyg i fler {\"{a}}mnen, {\"{a}}ven i teknik, matematik och naturorienterande {\"{a}}mnen. Bara i idrotten har pojkarna som grupp fortfarande h{\"{o}}gre betyg.
Elisabet {\"{O}}hrn understryker samtidigt att betygsskillnaden p{\r{a}} gruppniv{\r{a}} mellan k{\"{o}}nen {\"{a}}r mindre {\"{a}}n betygsskillnaden mellan dem som har f{\"{o}}r{\"{a}}ldrar med h{\"{o}}gskoleutbildning j{\"{a}}mf{\"{o}}rt med dem som inte har det. Social bakgrund och skillnad mellan skolor {\"{a}}r viktigare faktorer n{\"{a}}r betygsskillnader ska f{\"{o}}rklaras.
Men betygsskillnaderna mellan k{\"{o}}nen finns d{\"{a}}r likv{\"{a}}l, n{\r{a}}got som forskningen unders{\"{o}}kt orsakerna till.
Att flickorna skulle ha f{\"{o}}rdel av att m{\r{a}}nga l{\"{a}}rare {\"{a}}r kvinnor, liksom att undervisningen skulle vara mer i samklang med flickors intressen hittar forskningen inga bel{\"{a}}gg f{\"{o}}r, enligt Elisabet {\"{O}}hrn.
Det finns dock visst st{\"{o}}d inom forskningen f{\"{o}}r att det st{\"{a}}lls olika krav p{\r{a}} flickor och pojkar i skolan, liksom att det {\"{a}}r sv{\r{a}}rare f{\"{o}}r pojkar att hantera den individualiserade skolundervisningen som tar en allt st{\"{o}}rre plats.
Likas{\r{a}} visar forskningen att det {\"{a}}r mer accepterat med skolengagemang och plugg bland flickor {\"{a}}n bland pojkar - d{\"{a}}r finns klara skillnader i normer och ideal mellan k{\"{o}}nen.
– Pojkar avst{\r{a}}r ofta plugg av r{\"{a}}dsla f{\"{o}}r att misslyckas. N{\r{a}}gra pojkar pratade till och med om plugg som fusk. Idealet bland unga {\"{a}}r att vara beg{\r{a}}vad och smart d{\"{a}}r man n{\r{a}}r goda resultat utan anstr{\"{a}}ngning.

Olycklig antagonism
Elisabet {\"{O}}hrn menar att diskussionen om k{\"{o}}nen som antagonistiska {\"{a}}r olycklig.
– Metaforen om vinnare och f{\"{o}}rlorare i skolan, d{\"{a}}r den enes framg{\r{a}}ng framst{\r{a}}r som den andres f{\"{o}}rlust, {\"{a}}r olycklig. Den metaforen g{\r{a}}r igen i m{\r{a}}nga l{\"{a}}nder. Men forskning visar hur undervisning kan f{\"{o}}rb{\"{a}}ttra f{\"{o}}r en grupp utan att f{\"{o}}rs{\"{a}}mra f{\"{o}}r en annan. 
Elisabet {\"{O}}hrns f{\"{o}}rklaringar till metaforens starka genomslag och den offentliga oron f{\"{o}}r pojkars prestationer i slutet av 90-talet {\"{a}}r flera. En {\"{a}}r v{\"{a}}sterlandets de-industrialisering d{\"{a}}r jobben som inte kr{\"{a}}ver l{\"{a}}ngre utbildning alltmer f{\"{o}}rsvinner, vilket inneb{\"{a}}r att fler pojkgrupper nu {\"{a}}r i behov av b{\r{a}}de h{\"{o}}gre betyg och l{\"{a}}ngre utbildning. En annan {\"{a}}r just de f{\"{o}}rst{\"{a}}rkta k{\"{o}}nsskillnaderna d{\"{a}}r flickor som grupp presterar b{\"{a}}ttre i fler {\"{a}}mnen, {\"{a}}ven om den f{\"{o}}rst{\"{a}}rkningen {\"{a}}r m{\r{a}}ttlig fr{\r{a}}n 80-talet till idag. En tredje {\"{a}}r den {\"{o}}kade oron f{\"{o}}r arbetsl{\"{o}}shet och utanf{\"{o}}rskap.
I det n{\"{a}}mnda forskningsprojektet observerades bland annat nio niondeklasser, p{\r{a}} skolor i olika slags milj{\"{o}}er med varierande social struktur, under 475 lektioner plus raster med fokus p{\r{a}} prestation, betyg och k{\"{o}}n, ut{\"{o}}ver intervjuer med elever och skolpersonal.
– Det {\"{a}}r sv{\r{a}}rare f{\"{o}}r pojkarna att balansera kraven fr{\r{a}}n skolan med kraven fr{\r{a}}n kamraterna. Det finns ingen mots{\"{a}}ttning mellan att prestera v{\"{a}}l och ha status i kamratgruppen. Det som st{\r{a}}r fram som paradoxalt {\"{a}}r att det inte f{\r{a}}r synas att man har pluggat f{\"{o}}r att n{\r{a}} de goda resultaten.

Problematiska sj{\"{a}}lvstudier
Det finns dock inget st{\"{o}}d f{\"{o}}r h{\r{a}}llningen att utbildning inte skulle ses som viktigt av pojkar, samtidigt som det i vissa grupper finns v{\"{a}}ldigt lite av framtidshopp om att lyckas med vare sig utbildning eller yrkesdr{\"{o}}mmar.
I forskningsprojektet s{\r{a}}g man exempel p{\r{a}} hur skolor medvetet arbetade f{\"{o}}r att blanda olika elevgrupper.
– Det gav goda resultat, d{\"{a}}r eleverna drog nytta av varandra i blandade grupper med olika bakgrund. S{\"{a}}rskilt sj{\"{a}}lvstudierna {\"{a}}r problematiska f{\"{o}}r de grupper som saknar eller har begr{\"{a}}nsad hj{\"{a}}lp utanf{\"{o}}r skolan. Skolan kan organisera f{\"{o}}r {\"{o}}kad tillg{\r{a}}ng till sociala n{\"{a}}tverk och kamratst{\"{o}}d.
Den olyckliga homogeniseringen av k{\"{o}}nsgrupperna, som {\"{a}}r en av debattens konsekvenser, menar Elisabet {\"{O}}hrn bland annat g{\"{o}}r att den grupp av pojkar som {\"{a}}r h{\"{o}}gpresterande f{\r{a}}r {\"{a}}nnu mer uppm{\"{a}}rksamhet vilket mest f{\"{o}}rst{\"{a}}rker inb{\"{o}}rdes skillnader i pojkgruppen.

We use the SOVA hydrocode and model ejected materials for a sufficient time after impact to quantify the volume of gases that reach high enough altitudes (>Â 25Â km) to have global consequences. We vary impact angle, sediment thickness and porosity, water depth, and shock pressure for devolatilization and present the results in a dimensionless form so that the released gases can be estimated for any impact into a sedimentary target. Using new constraints on the Chicxulub impact angle and target composition, we estimate that 325Â Â±Â 130Â Gt of sulfur and 425Â Â±Â 160 Gt CO2 were ejected and produced severe changes to the global climate.},

Gastrointestinal disease outcomes are also more severe, due to under-nutrition and lack of intervention strategies in these regions. Poor water quality, sanitation and hygiene account for some 1.7 million deaths a year world-wide (3.1% of all deaths and 3.7% of all DALYâs), mainly through infectious diarrhoea. Nine out of 10 such deaths are in children and virtually all of the deaths are in developing countries. Major enteric pathogens in these children include: rotavirus, Campylobacter jejuni, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Shigella spp. and Vibrio cholerae O1, and possibly enteropathogenic E. coli, Aeromonas spp. V. cholerae O139, enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium difficile and Cryptosporidium parvum. All except the latter are easily control by chlorination of water, but recontamination of treated water is a huge problem. Emerging environmental pathogens, such as Helicobacter pylori and Burkholderia pseudomallei, may well be of significance in some regions. In adults, much less is understood of various sequellae such as myocarditis, diabetes, reactive arthritis and cancers some monthsâyears after initial infections. So in addition to the traditional pathogens (helminths, Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia hepatitis A and E) various enteroviruses, C. jejuni and H. pylori are emerging issues in adults.},

All the subjects were allowed light exertion and were given vitamins and liberal amounts of water; in addition, 2 of them received electrolytes. The studies were continued on 2 of the subjects who were given diets which provided 500 kcal and contained protein. 
The subjects experienced little or no hunger; halitosis became evident after 2 or 3 days, coinciding with the appearance of ketones in the urine, and undue sensitivity to cold appeared in the later stages of starvation. Losses of bodyweight amounted to 9.3, 14.1 and 9.5 kg, respectively; on the average, 810 g daily were lost during the first week, 330 g in the second week and about 250 g in the third and fourth weeks. The average daily losses of protein in the successive weeks were calculated to be 55, 36, 28 and 18 g; protein accounted for 7.6 to 9.1% of the weight lost and provided 5.0 to 6.9% of the energy expenditure. Protein lost during the whole period ranged from 704 to 1156 g, which represents 2.8 to 4.6 kg muscle and other cellular tissues. Creatinine excretion gradually decreased during starvation; it accounted for about 5% of the N loss initially and 15% in the later stages. Carbohydrate losses were estimated at 495 to 1050 g, accounting for 3.5 to 11.0% of the weight and providing 3.0 to 6.4% of the energy expenditure. Fat losses amounted to 4.1 to 6.5 kg, accounting for 44 to 68% of the weight loss and providing 87 to 90% of the energy expenditure. The average daily loss of fat was 215 g. Oxygen consumption and respiratory quotient decreased; the changes were proportionately greater than the changes in bodyweight and surface area. 
At the end of starvation cumulative net losses of water for the 3 subjects were 3.8, 6.0 and 1.2 litres, but when corrected for metabolic water produced the values were -1.6, -1.1 and +0.5 litre. Only minor changes in serum K. Na and Cl were found.-G. P. Garton.},

A comprehensive study was therefore undertaken to determine the contributions of product and preparation variables on the total soluble solids, caffeine, and polyphenol contents of tea extracts. The results of this study show that the variety, growing environment, manufacturing conditions, and grade (particle size) of the tea leaves each influence the tea leaf and final infusion compositions. In addition, the composition of the tea infusion was shown to be influenced by whether the tea was contained in a teabag and, if so, the size and material of construction of the bag. Finally, the preparation method, including the amounts of tea and water used, infusion time, and amount of agitation, was shown to be a major determinant of the component concentrations of tea beverages as consumed. An illustration of the variation introduced by these product and preparation factors is provided by comparing solids, caffeine, and polyphenol contents of green and black tea infusions when commercial products are prepared according to the instructions given on their packaging.

but recent findings question the role of SFAs. This expert panel reviewed
the evidence and reached the following conclusions: the evidence from
epidemiologic, clinical, and mechanistic studies is consistent in finding
that the risk of CHD is reduced when SFAs are replaced with polyun-
saturated fatty acids (PUFAs). In populations who consume a Western
diet, the replacement of 1% of energy from SFAs with PUFAs lowers
LDL cholesterol and is likely to produce a reduction in CHD incidence
of 2–3%. No clear benefit of substituting carbohydrates for SFAs has
been shown, although there might be a benefit if the carbohydrate is
unrefined and has a low glycemic index. Insufficient evidence exists to
judge the effect on CHD risk of replacing SFAs with MUFAs. No clear
association between SFA intake relative to refined carbohydrates and
the risk of insulin resistance and diabetes has been shown. The effect of
diet on a single biomarker is insufficient evidence to assess CHD risk.
The combination of multiple biomarkers and the use of clinical end-
points could help substantiate the effects on CHD. Furthermore, the
effect of particular foods on CHD cannot be predicted solely by their
content of total SFAs because individual SFAs may have different
cardiovascular effects and major SFA food sources contain other con-
stituents that could influence CHD risk. Research is needed to clarify
the role of SFAs compared with specific forms of carbohydrates in
CHD risk and to compare specific foods with appropriate alterna-
tives.

METHODS: During this study, slides from the four centres were subject ed to a centralized assessment of sperm morphology. The percentages of sperm def ects were recorded using a multiple-entry classification enabling the calculation of the multiple anomalies index (MAI), which is the mean number of anomalies p er abnormal sperm. The relationships between various sperm abnormalities and sel f-reported data on medical history, lifestyle and occupational factors were exam ined. RESULTS: Significant differences in the MAI and most of the sperm defects were found between the four cities, and more abnormalities were found in spring than in winter. An increase in some sperm abnormalities was related to medical t reatment of the mother during pregnancy, higher birthweight and previous treatme nt for cryptorchidism. Significant variations of several sperm defects were rela ted to stress, weekly working time, occupational posture and metal welding, sugg esting directions for further exposure studies. CONCLUSION: The present study in dicated that the detailed assessment of sperm abnormalities is a useful biomarke r of the effect of various external factors which may qualitatively affect human spermatogenesis.},

  abstract      = {During the last two decades, much research has focused on the mechanisms used by nonhuman primates for conflict resolution. Reconciliation, i.e., a friendly reunion between former opponents, has been reported in several primate species. Reconciliation seems to serve at least two functions. According to the Valuable Relationship Hypothesis, reconciliation restores the disturbed relationship between former opponents and, consequently, occurs more often between individuals with more valuable relationships. The Uncertainty-Reduction Hypothesis emphasizes the function of reconciliation to reduce anxiety and uncertainty in the recipient of aggression following a conflict. The study of post-conflict emotionality facilitates the integration of these two hypotheses. The present study focuses on the factors affecting post-conflict anxiety of the two former opponents. Post-conflict data of captive Barbary (Macaca sylvanus) and long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) are used here to examine patterns of anxiety-related behavior, such as self-scratching. The fact that in the first minutes following a conflict not only recipients of aggression but aggressors too increased the rate of scratching above baseline levels suggests that the risk of renewed attacks is unlikely to be the only reason for post-conflict anxiety. The quality of the relationship between former opponents was a good predictor of post-conflict scratching rates by the recipient of aggression: Rates were higher after conflicts between individuals with stronger affiliative relationships. This result was not due to differential risk of resuming hostilities or arousal resulting from the intensity of the previous conflict. This finding suggests that the disturbance of a valuable relationship due to the previous conflict (e.g., the potential loss of benefits provided by such relationships) is a major cause of post-conflict anxiety. In line with the Uncertainty-Reduction Hypothesis, the best way to cope with post-conflict anxiety is to reconcile and therefore restore the relationship. Higher levels of post-conflict anxiety should lead therefore to higher conciliatory tendency. This interpretation is supported by the fact that individuals with strong affiliative relationships reconcile more frequently than others, as predicted by the Valuable Relationship Hypothesis. The mediating role of emotions, such as post-conflict anxiety, is probably not limited to reconciliation. Other post-conflict interactions, such as consolation, triadic reconciliation, and mediation, are also likely to be better understood if future studies focus on the post-conflict emotions of the opponents and bystanders.

  abstract      = {Synthetic polymers are ubiquitous in the modern world but pose a global environmental problem. While plastics such as poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) are highly versatile, their resistance to natural degradation presents a serious, growing risk to fauna and flora, particularly in marine environments. Here, we have characterized the 3D structure of a newly discovered enzyme that can digest highly crystalline PET, the primary material used in the manufacture of single-use plastic beverage bottles, in some clothing, and in carpets. We engineer this enzyme for improved PET degradation capacity and further demonstrate that it can also degrade an important PET replacement, polyethylene-2,5-furandicarboxylate, providing new opportunities for biobased plastics recycling.Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is one of the most abundantly produced synthetic polymers and is accumulating in the environment at a staggering rate as discarded packaging and textiles. The properties that make PET so useful also endow it with an alarming resistance to biodegradation, likely lasting centuries in the environment. Our collective reliance on PET and other plastics means that this buildup will continue unless solutions are found. Recently, a newly discovered bacterium, Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6, was shown to exhibit the rare ability to grow on PET as a major carbon and energy source. Central to its PET biodegradation capability is a secreted PETase (PET-digesting enzyme). Here, we present a 0.92 {\r A} resolution X-ray crystal structure of PETase, which reveals features common to both cutinases and lipases. PETase retains the ancestral Î±/Î²-hydrolase fold but exhibits a more open active-site cleft than homologous cutinases. By narrowing the binding cleft via mutation of two active-site residues to conserved amino acids in cutinases, we surprisingly observe improved PET degradation, suggesting that PETase is not fully optimized for crystalline PET degradation, despite presumably evolving in a PET-rich environment. Additionally, we show that PETase degrades another semiaromatic polyester, polyethylene-2,5-furandicarboxylate (PEF), which is an emerging, bioderived PET replacement with improved barrier properties. In contrast, PETase does not degrade aliphatic polyesters, suggesting that it is generally an aromatic polyesterase. These findings suggest that additional protein engineering to increase PETase performance is realistic and highlight the need for further developments of structure/activity relationships for biodegradation of synthetic polyesters.},

  abstract      = {It has now been 50 years since Dolman [1] reviewed type E botulism in Arctic and subarctic regions. As Dolman reported, records of foodborne illness among North American aboriginal peoples date back to Stefansson's descriptions of “white whale poisoning” in his expedition to the Mackenzie River delta [2]. Upon returning to the Mackenzie delta, Stefansson found that a group of 8 of his acquaintances “had been poisoned by eating the meat of a freshly killed white whale.” Botulism after consumption of traditionally prepared foods has been reported in coastal areas of the North including Alaska, the Pacific coast of British Columbia, northern Canada (Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Nunavik, and Labrador), and Greenland [3–12].

The majority of botulism outbreaks in Alaska, northern Canada, and Greenland have been caused by consumption of the flesh of marine mammals and fish. Traditionally-aged meats called igunaq have been frequently implicated in botulism cases among the Canadian Inuit population. The traditional preparation involves placing meat and fat tissues into skin bags (puurtaq), which are sewn shut and aged for weeks or months under rocks or buried under gravel [13]. However, it has become common practice in the Nunavik region and elsewhere to use either plastic bags or buckets, metal barrels, or glass containers in place of the skin pouch. Among Pacific coast First Nations people and Alaska Natives in southeast Alaska, foodborne botulism is caused by salmon eggs (“stink eggs”) aged in airtight jars [4, 7, 12, 14, 15].

While traditionally prepared northern foods are often incorrectly referred to as being “fermented,” they are not actually fermented. Fermentation requires a carbohydrate substrate and results in organic acid production with a subsequent reduction in pH. Fermentation has been used as a safe method of food preparation for millennia. Since the meat, fat, and skin of marine mammals contain very little fermentable carbohydrates, fermentation does not occur and the pH remains neutral. This aging process is rather a putrefaction or advanced decomposition of proteins and fat that allows growth of Clostridium botulinum (type E strains are inhibited at a pH of ≤5) and production of botulinum neurotoxin.

As Fagan et al [16] note, contamination of seal meat could occur during butchering, particularly when tissues are cut and placed in contact with the shoreline soil or rocks. In Alaska, spores of C. botulinum type E are widely distributed along the coast and have been isolated near locations where botulism outbreaks have previously occurred [17]. C. botulinum type E has been found in high incidences in other northern areas where botulism is endemic, including 86% of samples from the marine environment of Greenland [18] and 88% of samples of shoreline soils from the Ungava Bay region of Quebec [19]. Marine mammals may also be a possible source of C. botulinum spores [20].

The mean annual number of cases per population among Alaska Natives appeared to increase during the 1970s and 1980s, reaching a peak in 1990–1994. Could this be an apparent increase resulting from more thorough identification and reporting of incidents since 1970, or has it resulted from changes in food preparation practice? Decreasing incidence of botulism cases since the late 1990s might be attributed to decreasing consumption of traditional foods by younger Alaska Natives. Fagan et al [16] report that the incidence of botulism was greatest among Alaska Natives aged ≥60 years. This agrees with studies indicating that traditional foods are eaten more frequently by older Alaska Natives [21, 22].

Dolman [1] recognized in 1960 that control of botulism in the Arctic and sub-Arctic is “mainly a problem of education in public health.” The summary presented by Fagan et al [16] in this issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases is important work that should aid in the development of educational materials to reduce the incidence of botulism in Alaska. The limited population affected by botulism in the North could allow targeted education to make a large impact on the incidence of botulism. Hauschild and Gauvreau [7] reported a decrease in cases among the First Nations population of coastal British Columbia that was attributed to efforts of public health agencies to discourage the consumption of traditionally prepared salmon eggs. Fagan et al [16] have recommended that educational materials should be disseminated to women and elders because they are more exposed to the disease. Local producers of aquatic-game foods should also be informed on how to minimize contamination during the butchering process and prevent growth and toxin production of C. botulinum type E during aging. In northern Canada, some of these traditionally prepared foods may be sold in a food store by local producers, but generally they are shared locally among family members and friends or with persons from other neighboring villages (intercommunity trade).

Traditional foods contribute both nutritional and cultural benefits to the Canadian Inuit who consume them. Key nutrients provided to the diet by “country foods” include iron, zinc, vitamins A and E, and sometimes vitamin C. Marine mammal blubber, a traditional food eaten by Canadian Inuit, is an important source of omega-3 fatty acids. Rather than discourage consumption of traditional foods, it would be preferable to identify high-risk meat-handling practices to reduce the incidence and extent of contamination of marine mammal meat, yet allow the continuation of traditional customs and practices. Boiling aged aquatic-game foods is not an acceptable option for consumers who prefer the traditional taste of this delicacy, and hence efforts should be directed at controlling growth of C. botulinum type E to prevent development of toxigenesis. Culturally appropriate educational materials focusing on safer traditional fermentation processes have been prepared by the Alaska State Department of Health, in partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [23]. While it has been suggested that use of plastic and glass containers, rather than traditional skin containers, may provide an environment more conducive to growth of C. botulinum [21, 24], this has not been experimentally shown. Storing food preparations at temperatures of <3°C, below the minimum growth temperature of C. botulinum type E, during the aging process should reduce the risk associated with traditional foods.

  abstract      = {Abstract The presence of microplastics in the marine environment poses a great threat to the entire ecosystem and has received much attention lately as the presence has greatly impacted oceans, lakes, seas, rivers, coastal areas and even the Polar Regions. Microplastics are found in most commonly utilized products (primary microplastics), or may originate from the fragmentation of larger plastic debris (secondary microplastics). The material enters the marine environment through terrestrial and land-based activities, especially via runoffs and is known to have great impact on marine organisms as studies have shown that large numbers of marine organisms have been affected by microplastics. Microplastic particles have been found distributed in large numbers in Africa, Asia, Southeast Asia, India, South Africa, North America, and in Europe. This review describes the sources and global distribution of microplastics in the environment, the fate and impact on marine biota, especially the food chain. Furthermore, the control measures discussed are those mapped out by both national and international environmental organizations for combating the impact from microplastics. Identifying the main sources of microplastic pollution in the environment and creating awareness through education at the public, private, and government sectors will go a long way in reducing the entry of microplastics into the environment. Also, knowing the associated behavioral mechanisms will enable better understanding of the impacts for the marine environment. However, a more promising and environmentally safe approach could be provided by exploiting the potentials of microorganisms, especially those of marine origin that can degrade microplastics. Capsule The concentration, distribution sources and fate of microplastics in the global marine environment were discussed, so also was the impact of microplastics on a wide range of marine biota. },

conduction study parameters were not found in the patient group, but the amplitude
of compound muscle action potential of the median and fibular nerves and sensory
nerve action potential amplitude of the sural nerve were lower than the control group,
and distal motor latency of the posterior tibial nerve was significantly prolonged as
compared with the control group. The latency of visual evoked potential was pro-

more prominent on the central nervous system than on the neuromuscular system,

To account for the reduced lecture, didactic content was recorded and posted online for viewing outside of the classroom. A second experimental section, also in a blended and flipped format, was examined the following semester as a replication. To measure student subject-matter learning, we used a standardized multiple-choice exam, and to measure student perceptions of the classroom, we used a validated survey instrument. Our findings demonstrated that in an active learning classroom, student faculty contact could be reduced by two-thirds and students achieved learning outcomes that were at least as good, and in one comparison significantly better than, those in a traditional classroom. Concurrently, student perceptions of the learning environment were improved. This suggests that pedagogically speaking, active learning classrooms, though they seat fewer students per square foot, are actually a more efficient use of physical space. },

A combined analysis of more than 200 studies assessing the link between alcohol and various types of cancer (i.e., a meta-analysis) sought to investigate this association in more detail. This meta-analysis found that alcohol most strongly increased the risks for cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, esophagus, and larynx. Statistically significant increases in risk also existed for cancers of the stomach, colon, rectum, liver, female breast, and ovaries. Several mechanisms have been postulated through which alcohol may contribute to an increased risk of cancer. Concurrent tobacco use, which is common among drinkers, enhances alcohol's effects on the risk for cancers of the upper digestive and respiratory tract. The analysis did not identify a threshold level of alcohol consumption below which no increased risk for cancer was evident.},

  abstract      = {Declining sperm count reports have caused enormous concern to both the scientific community and to society. We reproduced the linear regression analysis and the quadratic model analysis using the 50 year sperm count data published in Carlsen's report and found that neither model adequately described the data. The reported decline in sperm count could be due to observational bias and overinterpretation of linear regression. In fact only 36% of the total variability in sperm count was explained by the linear model and 42% by the quadratic model. The linear model was no longer valid when three new European reports on sperm counts were included in the analysis. The quadratic model, however, suggested an upward trend of sperm count after 1975 (R 2 = 0.48, P <0.0001). Factors other than the 'passage of time' may have contributed to the initial decline of sperm count An immediate candidate was demography. Our analysis showed that sperm counts in USA were significantly higher in 1938-1956 compared with those in 1957-1974 and 1975-1988, but not in the European or Asian/African/South American countries. The variability of the USA sperm count (1938-1988) explained by the linear and quadratic models was found to be 71 and 70% respectively. The quadratic model importantly indicated that the sperm count in USA decreases asymptot- ically towards a limiting value and global sperm counts could be increasing since 1970. The non-uniform nature of the global sperm count change suggested that local vari- ations in pollution, diet but not global warming were important determinants of reproductive health.

Up to 50\% of this viscous blood is actively expelled into the systemic circulation during strenuous exercise or simulated apnoea (breathâhold) diving. The contribution of splenic contraction to changes in the circulating volume of red blood cells (RBCV), as well as the venous concentration of white blood cells (WBC) and platelets (PLT), was investigated following repeated breathâhold apnoeas. 2.âEighteen trained apnoea divers and 18 intact and six splenectomized subjects without diving experience repeated five maximal apnoeas with face immersion in cold water, with 2Â min intervals between successive attempts. Venous blood samples were taken before and between consecutive apnoeas, as well as at 0, 10 and 20Â min after the last breath hold. Arterial pressure, heart rate and transcutaneous partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide were monitored continuously. 3.âPlasma protein concentration decreased by 5.8, 2.2 and 9\% in apnoea divers, untrained and splenectomized subjects, respectively, indicating an expansion of plasma volume. The RBCV and venous concentration of WBC, corrected for changes in plasma volume, increased in both trained apnoea divers (4.9Â Â±Â 1.0 and 14.9Â Â±Â 3.1\%, respectively) and intact subjects (1.7Â Â±Â 0.8 and 7.2Â Â±Â 1.8\%, respectively), whereas in splenectomized subjects there was no change in RBCV and a delayed increase in WBC concentration. Furthermore, an initial lymphocytosis detected during repeated breath holds in divers and intact subjects was completely absent in splenectomized subjects. None of the groups showed significant changes in PLT concentrations. The wellârecognized diving response to apnoea (bradycardia and increased blood pressure) was seen during all breathâhold attempts in all subjects. 4.âRepeated breathâholds (apnoeas) contribute to increased RBCV and venous blood concentrations of WBC through splenic contraction.},

The program deals with bullying and violence. It consists of three videos and a booklet that help students to develop the social cognitive competence skills to understand the negative consequences of aggressive behavior. The intervention was evaluated using an experimental design with pre-test and post-test analyses. Students were randomly allocated to experimental or control classes. Students completed a self-report questionnaire in which they were asked to indicate on a 5-point scale how often they were victimized or bullied others. Victimization and bullying were assessed by using questions about specific types of actions, a composite measure of victimization and bullying, and a single question about victimization and bullying in general. Results showed that the program worked best for older students, but not for younger ones who in some cases reported an increased level of victimization after the intervention. For older students there was a decrease in victimization according to the sum of types of behavior for the experimental group, but an increase for the control group. The same result was found for direct victimization, having belongings stolen, and being called nasty names. Therefore, the program seemed to be beneficial for older students but possibly damaging for younger students. It is suggested that the program could have worked better with older students because of the cognitive skills it required. Younger students could have reported higher levels of bullying after the intervention because they became more sensitized to the topic of bullying. Aggr.

Early conceptions of trauma-related disorders focused on physical signs of distress while current ones emphasize mental symptoms, but traumatizing experiences evoke psychobiological reactions. An evolutionary perspective presumes that psychophysical reactions to traumatizing events evolved to ensure survival. This theoretical review examines several primitive mechanisms (e.g., sensitization and dissolution) associated with responses to diverse stressors, from danger to life-threat. Some rapidly acquired symptoms form without conscious awareness because severe stresses can dysregulate mental and physical components within systems ensuring survival. Varied defensive options engage specialized and enduring psychophysical reactions; this allows for more adaptive responses to diverse threats. Thus, parasympathetically mediated defense states such as freeze or collapse increase trauma-related symptom variability. Comorbidity and symptom variability confuse those expecting mental rather than psychophysical responses to trauma, and active (sympathetically mediated flight and fight) rather than immobility defenses. Healthcare implications for stress research, clinical practice and diagnostic nosology stem from the broader evolutionary view.},

  abstract      = {Alcoholic fatty liver and hyperlipemia result from the interaction of ethanol and its oxidation products with hepatic lipid metabolism. An early target of ethanol toxicity is mito-chondrial fatty acid oxidation. Acetaldehyde and reactive oxygen species have been incriminated in the pathogenesis of the mitochondrial injury. Microsomal changes offset deleterious accumulation of fatty acids, leading to enhanced formation of triacylglycerols, which are partly secreted into the plasma and partly accumulate in the liver. However, this compensatory mechanism fades with progression of the liver injury, whereas the production of toxic metabolites increases, exacerbating the lesions and promoting fibrogenesis. The early presence of these changes confers to the fatty liver a worse prognosis than previously thought. Alcoholic hyperlipemia results primarily from increased hepatic secretion of very-low-density lipoprotein and secondarily from impairment in the removal of triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins from the plasma . Hyperlipemia tends to disappear because of enhanced lipolytic activity and aggravation of the liver injury. With moderate alcohol consumption, the increase in high-density lipoprotein becomes the predominant feature. Its mechanism is multifactorial (increased hepatic secretion and increased extra-hepatic formation as well as decreased removal) and explains part of the enhanced cholesterol transport from tissues to bile. These changes contribute to, but do not fully account for, the effects on atherosclerosis and/or coronary heart disease attributed to moderate drinking.},

  abstract      = {Alcohol promotes accumulation of fat in the liver mainly by substitution of ethanol for fatty acids as the major hepatic fuel. The degree of lipid accumulation depends on the supply of dietary fat. Progressive alteration of the mitochondria, which occurs during chronic alcohol consumption, decreases fatty acid oxidation by interfering with citric acid cycle activity. This block is partially compensated for by increased ketone body production, which results in ketonemia. Thus, mitochondrial damage perpetuates fatty acid accumulation even in the absence of ethanol oxidation. Alcohol facilitates esterification of the accumulated fatty acids to triglycerides, phospholipids, and cholesterol esters, all of which accumulate in the liver. The accumulated lipids are disposed of in part as serum lipoprotein, resulting in moderate hyperlipemia. In some individuals with pre-existing alterations of lipid metabolism, small ethanol dose may provoke marked hyperlipemia which responds to alcohol withdrawal. Inhibition of the catabolism of cholesterol to bile salt may contribute to the hepatic accumulation and hypercholesterolemia. The capacity of lipoprotein production and hyperlipemia development increases during chronic alcohol consumption, probably as a result of the concomitant hypertrophy of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. However, this compensation is relatively inefficient in ridding the liver of fat. This inefficiency may be linked to alterations of hepatic microtubules induced by ethanol or its metabolites, which interfere with the export of protein from liver to serum, promoting hepatic accumulation of proteins as well as fat. As liver injury aggravates, hyperlipemia wanes and liver steatosis is exaggerated. Derangements of serum lipids similar to those found in other types of liver disease also become apparent. The changes in serum lipids may be a sensitive indicator of the progression of liver damage in the alcoholic.},

However, very few genetic loci have been identified, and the underlying mechanisms of AFB and NEB are poorly understood. We report a large genome-wide association study of both sexes including 251,151 individuals for AFB and 343,072 individuals for NEB. We identified 12 independent loci that are significantly associated with AFB and/or NEB in a SNP-based genome-wide association study and 4 additional loci associated in a gene-based effort. These loci harbor genes that are likely to have a role, either directly or by affecting non-local gene expression, in human reproduction and infertility, thereby increasing understanding of these complex traits.},

  abstract      = {The year 2006 should not be allowed to pass without at least a quiet celebration that this is the first year in human history when—across almost all the world—women can expect to enjoy a longer life expectancy than men. That the trend is moving in this direction will probably be confirmed this week in the 2006 world health report.

In its world health report of 2002, the World Health Organization, using data for 2001, reported that male life expectancy exceeded female life expectancy in only six countries: Nepal, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Bangladesh, and Swaziland.1 A year later, the situation seemed to have reversed in all six countries, with two other countries (Qatar and the Maldives) reporting that men were living slightly longer than women.2 In its 2004 report the WHO continued to report the same 2002 data and in only those two tiny territories (the Maldives and Qatar) did women die younger than men.3 In the 2005 report, life expectancy data for 2003 were reported, but only to the nearest year of age, making comparison difficult.4

In January this year the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) updated its World Factbook and reported its estimates for life expectancy in 2005.5 According to the CIA, in Qatar and the Maldives women now lived longer than men. Elsewhere, however, women's fate had slipped back, by the CIA estimates which do not tally with the WHO data for earlier years. According to the CIA, in Niger women could expect to live a dozen days less than men and in Botswana three dozen days less by 2005, but nearer to two years less in Zimbabwe and Kenya by 2005. The underlying source of the CIA data is vague, as befits a somewhat secretive organisation. We will never know with certainty the exact year in which women everywhere can expect to live on average longer than men, but this year—2006—is as likely as any.

Almost 30 years ago, amid much fanfare, the eradication of smallpox was announced.6 But when it becomes certain that women everywhere can expect to live longer than men, also a remarkable achievement, a similar announcement is unlikely. We tend to forget that in many countries of the world women could expect, until recently, to live fewer years than men and that maternal mortality in particular remains a big killer.

The most reliable historical mortality records are in Europe, where states were sufficiently affluent and interested to keep accurate records. In Europe men last outlived women in the Netherlands in 1860 and in Italy in 1889. Elsewhere females' life expectancy has long exceeded males': in Sweden since 1751, Denmark since 1835, England and Wales since 1841.7

But in all western European countries the life expectancy gap between women and men is now narrowing. Except in one aberrant year, 1789, the gap reached its maximum in Sweden in 1978 (6.2 years); in Denmark in 1979 (6.2 years); and in England and Wales in 1969 (6.3 years).

Greater emancipation has freed women to demand better health care and to behave more like men, and most importantly to smoke. A century ago it would have been hard to imagine such changes, or the fact that women now expect to live longer than men almost everywhere. As this transition is so recent, the processes driving it cannot be purely biological: they relate primarily to social change. In a way, women's life expectancy is an indicator of how well everyone can do, akin to the healthy districts identified in the 1850s by William Farr, the British epidemiologist who first reported on health inequalities.8 In 1990 Amartya Sen, Indian economist and Nobel laureate, concluded from an analysis of unequal rights between men and women and mortality in the developing world that, worldwide, more than 100 million women were missing.9 The women who were born when Sen wrote this are coming of age in a very different world. We must remember, though, that life expectancy data apply from birth onwards. The picture would be different in some countries if life expectancy from conception was considered: the first doctor to be imprisoned for carrying out sex selective abortion in India was sentenced on 28 March 2006, which may be another landmark.10 Even the life expectancy from birth may not be a permanent achievement, given that the largest remaining untapped market for cigarettes in the world is made up of women living in poorer countries.},

  abstract      = {BACKGROUND: Vaginal anatomy has been poorly studied. This study aimed to measure baseline dimensions of the undistended vagina of women of reproductive age. 

METHODS: We combined baseline information collected from five clinical trials using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to quantify distribution of a vaginal gel. Seventy-seven MRI scans were performed on 28 women before gel application to establish baseline vaginal measurements. Average dimensions were calculated for each woman and for the population. The influence of potential covariates (age, height, weight and parity) on these dimensions was assessed. 

RESULTS: MRI measurements are reproducible. The SD surrounding the mean at each anatomical site, and with summary measurements, was significantly smaller with each subject compared with the population. Mean vaginal length from cervix to introitus was 62.7 mm. Vaginal width was largest in the proximal vagina (32.5 mm), decreased as it passed through the pelvic diaphragm (27.8 mm) and smallest at the introitus (26.2 mm). Significant positive associations were parity with vaginal fornix length, age with pelvic flexure width and the height with width at the pelvic flexure. 

CONCLUSION: No one description characterized the shape of the human vagina. Although there is variation among women, variables such as parity, age and height are positively associated with differences in baseline dimensions.

However, a global, quantitative view of how the biomass of different taxa compare with one another is still lacking. Here, we assemble the overall biomass composition of the biosphere, establishing a census of the â550 gigatons of carbon (Gt C) of biomass distributed among all of the kingdoms of life. We find that the kingdoms of life concentrate at different locations on the planet; plants (â450 Gt C, the dominant kingdom) are primarily terrestrial, whereas animals (â2 Gt C) are mainly marine, and bacteria (â70 Gt C) and archaea (â7 Gt C) are predominantly located in deep subsurface environments. We show that terrestrial biomass is about two orders of magnitude higher than marine biomass and estimate a total of â6 Gt C of marine biota, doubling the previous estimated quantity. Our analysis reveals that the global marine biomass pyramid contains more consumers than producers, thus increasing the scope of previous observations on inverse food pyramids. Finally, we highlight that the mass of humans is an order of magnitude higher than that of all wild mammals combined and report the historical impact of humanity on the global biomass of prominent taxa, including mammals, fish, and plants.},

  abstract      = {A relationship between alcohol intake and aggressive behavior has been demonstrated in both associational and laboratory studies. Among the factors that contribute to aggression during intoxication are a history of violence and the level of alcohol-induced stimulation. In humans, excessive alcohol intake and alcoholism are predicted by decreased sensitivity, or a low level of response (LOR), to alcohol. In addition, aggressive behavior, LOR, and alcoholism have been attributed to CNS serotonergic dysfunction. Given that they are both related to diminished CNS serotonin, in this study we wanted to determine whether a low LOR to alcohol would be associated with aggression during intoxication in rhesus macaques. Adolescent rhesus macaques (N=115) received an intravenous dose of ethanol (2.2g/kg) and were scored for their levels of response for 30 minutes. Following provocation by an investigator, animals were then scored for aggressive behaviors (lunges, open-mouth threats, stares, head-bobs, and barks) for five minutes. At the approximate age of five years, animals were entered into a free-access alcohol consumption study, during which they were allowed voluntary access for one hour/day, four days/week to aspartame-sweetened alcohol or vehicle. Alcohol intake for each subject was determined using a computerized collar, which was detected by a station system that measured individual subject consumption rates. Data were analyzed using regression analyses and t-tests. Decreased sensitivity to alcohol, alcohol-induced increases in CSF MHPG, and pre-alcohol CSF levels of 5-HIAA were associated independently with aggression during intoxication (r= -0.32, P= 0.0006 , r = - 0.29, P=0.01, and r= -0.21, P=0.02, respectively). High rates of alcohol-related aggression predicted future alcohol consumption (r=0.27, p=0.004), even after controlling for rearing condition and monoamine metabolite concentrations, previously shown in these animals to predict alcohol consumption. By investigating the relationships between LOR, central catecholamine reactivity and function, and alcohol-induced aggression in alcohol-naïve nonhuman primates, this report provides evidence that alcohol-induced stimulation and neurotransmitter-linked predisposition to impulsive aggression independently contribute to aggression during intoxication. This paper further emphasizes the importance of the nonhuman primate model for studying susceptibility to alcohol-related aggression and alcoholism, because variables such as prior exposure to alcohol are difficult to control in human subjects.

Is the number of common skin color genes closer to five, 50, or 500? Do gain- and loss-of-function alleles for a small set of genes give rise to phenotypes at opposite ends of the pigmentary spectrum? Has the effect of natural selection on similar pigmentation phenotypes proceeded independently via similar pathways?

Data sources: All original research articles published in Lancet and BMJ during 1999 and 2000. Main outcome measures: Inclusion of articles in Lancet or BMJ press releases, and reporting of articles in Times or Sun newspapers. Results: Of 1193 original research articles, 517 (43\%) were highlighted in a press release and 81 (7\%) were reported in one or both newspapers. All articles covered in newspapers had been press released. The probability of inclusion in press releases was similar for observational studies and randomised controlled trials, but trials were less likely to be covered in the newspapers (odds ratio 0.15 (95\% confidence interval 0.06 to 0.37)). Good news and bad news were equally likely to be press released, but bad news was more likely to be reported in newspapers (1.74 (1.07 to 2.83)). Studies of women{\textquoteright}s health, reproduction, and cancer were more likely to be press released and covered in newspapers. Studies from industrialised countries other than Britain were less likely to be reported in newspapers (0.51 (0.31 to 0.82)), and no studies from developing countries were covered. Conclusions: Characteristics of articles were more strongly associated with selection for reporting in newspapers than with selection for inclusion in press releases, although each stage influenced the reporting process. Newspapers underreported randomised trials, emphasised bad news from observational studies, and ignored research from developing countries.

that herpesvirus latency also confers a surprising benefit to the
host. Mice latently infected with either murine gammaherpesvirus
68 or murine cytomegalovirus, which are genetically highly
similar to the human pathogens Epstein–Barr virus and human
cytomegalovirus, respectively, are resistant to infection with the
bacterial pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Yersinia pestis.
Latency-induced protection is not antigen specific but involves
prolonged production of the antiviral cytokine interferon-c and
systemic activation of macrophages. Latency thereby upregulates
the basal activation state of innate immunity against subsequent
infections. We speculate that herpesvirus latency may also sculpt
the immune response to self and environmental antigens through
establishment of a polarized cytokine environment. Thus, whereas
the immune evasion capabilities and lifelong persistence of herpesviruses
are commonly viewed as solely pathogenic, our data suggest that latency is a 
symbiotic relationship with immune benefits
for the host.},

  abstract      = {Misrepresentation of terminology is a major impediment for attempts at enhancing public conservation literacy. Despite being critically important for improving conservation practice, there have been few systematic analyses of the popular use of conservation terminology. This paper draws from science communication studies and metaphor analysis, to examine how keystone, flagship and umbrella species concepts are used and represented in non-academic contexts. 557 news articles containing these terms were systematically analyzed. Mammals featured in 60{\%} of articles on keystones, 55{\%} on flagships and 63{\%} on umbrella species. Number of articles explaining the terms keystone (35{\%}) and flagship (31{\%}) was low, and keystones were the most misrepresented term. Keystones were metaphorically linked with balance, flagships with representation and umbrella species with protection. These metaphors influenced public interpretation of scientific terminology, oriented actions towards select species, and led to a valuation of such actions. Together, the findings highlight three important aspects of popular use of conservation terminology: (1) communication is largely biased towards mammals, (2) everyday language plays a vital role in the interpretation of concepts, and (3) metaphors influence peoples' actions and understanding. Conservation biologists need to engage with issues of language if public conservation literacy is to be improved. Further evaluations of concepts with high public and policy relevance, systematic identification of communication shortfalls, and linguistic assessments prior to promoting new terms are potential ways of achieving this.},

This chapter considers the relationship between the size of three digestive organs (stomach, intestine, and liver) and food intake, diet type (e.g. degree of softness/hardness in the case of carnivores and fiber-content in the case of herbivores), and seasonal factors. Our arguments are based on comparisons of diet-organ size associations within ecologically and phylogenetically uniform groups and on analyses of organ size changes within species and individuals. The phenotypic flexibility of the digestive organs is considerable; changes of 10–100% in organ size in response to changing conditions are found in a wide range of bird groups. Experimental work has shown changes in gizzard size of 50–100% in just 5–7 days. Ease of breakdown of food (a function of the strength of protective hard parts or the amount of fibrous ingredients) and total food intake determine the size of the stomach (and more specifically, its muscular part, the gizzard). Food intake also influences the size of the small intestine and the liver. Among waders (Suborder Charadrii), taxa consuming and crushing hard-shelled mollusks also have a heavier intestine (but not liver) than taxa eating softer foods. Much work remains to be done investigating the fine-tuning of capacities among the different digestive organs, the precise trade-offs involved in organ size changes, and the genetic basis of organ size and flexibility.},

can provide an invaluable glimpse into potential future ocean changes, but only if the story they tell is accurately interpreted.
Chlorophyll is not simply a measure of phytoplankton biomass, but also registers changes in intracellular pigmentation arising
from light-driven (photoacclimation) and nutrient-driven physiological responses. Here, we show that the photoacclimation
response is an important component of temporal chlorophyll variability across the global ocean. This attribution implies that
contemporary relationships between chlorophyll changes and ocean warming are not indicative of proportional changes in
productivity, as light-driven decreases in chlorophyll can be associated with constant or even increased photosynthesis.
Extension of these results to future change, however, requires further evaluation of how the multifaceted stressors of a warmer,
higher-CO 2 world will impact plankton communities.},

Using information from genetic and behavioural studies, the article identifies those who conceive younger, live in deprivation, are in long term relationships (rather than marriages), or in certain cultural groups are at higher risk. Public health consequences of PD being exposed include family break up and violence. However, leaving PD undiagnosed means cases having incorrect information on their genetics and fathers continuing to suspect that children may not be theirs. Increasing paternity testing and use of DNA techniques in clinical and judicial procedures means more cases of PD will be identified. Given developing roles for individual's genetics in decisions made by health services, private services (for example, insurance), and even in personal lifestyle decisions, the dearth of intelligence on how and when PD should be exposed urgently needs addressing. },

However, malformations in fossilized gymnosperm pollen from the extinction interval suggest biological stress coinciding with pulsed forest decline. These grains are hypothesized to have been caused by enhanced ultraviolet-B (UV-B) irradiation from volcanism-induced ozone shield deterioration. We tested this proposed mechanism by observing the effects of inferred end-Permian UV-B regimes on pollen development and reproductive success in living conifers. We find that pollen malformation frequencies increase fivefold under high UV-B intensities. Surprisingly, all trees survived but were sterilized under enhanced UV-B. These results support the hypothesis that heightened UV-B stress could have contributed not only to pollen malformation production but also to deforestation during Permian-Triassic crisis intervals. By reducing the fertility of several widespread gymnosperm lineages, pulsed ozone shield weakening could have induced repeated terrestrial biosphere destabilization and food web collapse without exerting a direct {\textquotedblleft}kill{\textquotedblright} mechanism on land plants or animals. These findings challenge the paradigm that mass extinctions require kill mechanisms and suggest that modern conifer forests may be considerably more vulnerable to anthropogenic ozone layer depletion than expected.},

A systematic review was conducted to assess the evidence linking beer consumption to abdominal and general obesity. Following a systematic search strategy, 35 eligible observational studies and 12 experimental studies were identified. Regarding abdominal obesity, most observational data pointed towards a positive association or no association between beer intake and waist circumference or waist-to-hip ratio in men, whereas results for women were inconsistent. Data from a subset of studies indicated that beer intake > 500 mL/day may be positively associated with abdominal obesity. Regarding general obesity, most observational studies pointed towards an inverse association or no association between beer intake and body weight in women and a positive association or no association in men. Data from six experimental studies in men, in which alcoholic beer was compared with low-alcoholic beer, suggested that consumption of alcoholic beer (for 21-126 days) results in weight gain (0.73 kg; P < 0.0001), but data from four studies comparing intake of alcoholic beer with intake of no alcohol did not support this finding. Generally, experimental studies had low-quality data. In conclusion, the available data provide inadequate scientific evidence to assess whether beer intake at moderate levels (<500 mL/day) is associated with general or abdominal obesity. Higher intake, however, may be positively associated with abdominal obesity.},

  abstract      = {Modern medicine has progressed in parallel with the advancement of biochemistry, anatomy, and physiology. By using the tools of modern medicine, the physician today can treat and prevent a number of diseases through pharmacology, genetics, and physical interventions. Besides this materia medica, the patient's mind, cognitions, and emotions play a central part as well in any therapeutic outcome, as investigated by disciplines such as psychoneuroendocrinoimmunology. This review describes recent findings that give scientific evidence to the old tenet that patients must be both cured and cared for. In fact, we are today in a good position to investigate complex psychological factors, like placebo effects and the doctor-patient relationship, by using a physiological and neuroscientific approach. These intricate psychological factors can be approached through biochemistry, anatomy, and physiology, thus eliminating the old dichotomy between biology and psychology. This is both a biomedical and a philosophical enterprise that is changing the way we approach and interpret medicine and human biology. In the first case, curing the disease only is not sufficient, and care of the patient is of tantamount importance. In the second case, the philosophical debate about the mind-body interaction can find some important answers in the study of placebo effects. Therefore, maybe paradoxically, the placebo effect and the doctor-patient relationship can be approached by using the same biochemical, cellular and physiological tools of the materia medica, which represents an epochal transition from general concepts such as suggestibility and power of mind to a true physiology of the doctor-patient interaction.},

We examine a selection of papers rejecting AGW. An analytical tool has been developed to replicate and test the results and methods used in these studies; our replication reveals a number of methodological flaws, and a pattern of common mistakes emerges that is not visible when looking at single isolated cases. Thus, real-life scientific disputes in some cases can be resolved, and we can learn from mistakes. A common denominator seems to be missing contextual information or ignoring information that does not fit the conclusions, be it other relevant work or related geophysical data. In many cases, shortcomings are due to insufficient model evaluation, leading to results that are not universally valid but rather are an artifact of a particular experimental setup. Other typical weaknesses include false dichotomies, inappropriate statistical methods, or basing conclusions on misconceived or incomplete physics. We also argue that science is never settled and that both mainstream and contrarian papers must be subject to sustained scrutiny. The merit of replication is highlighted and we discuss how the quality of the scientific literature may benefit from replication.},

  abstract      = {Abstract The advantages provided to memory by the distribution of multiple practice or study opportunities are among the most powerful effects in memory research. In this paper, we critically review the class of theories that presume contextual or encoding variability as the sole basis for the advantages of distributed practice, and recommend an alternative approach based on the idea that some study events remind learners of other study events. Encoding variability theory encounters serious challenges in two important phenomena that we review here: superadditivity and nonmonotonicity. The bottleneck in such theories lies in the assumption that mnemonic benefits arise from the increasing independence, rather than interdependence, of study opportunities. The reminding model accounts for many basic results in the literature on distributed practice, readily handles data that are problematic for encoding variability theories, including superadditivity and nonmonotonicity, and provides a unified theoretical framework for understanding the effects of repetition and the effects of associative relationships on memory.},

Here, we highlight the most relevant recent data, reporting either beneficial or adverse effects.
Recent findings: Phytoestrogens are natural molecules from edible plants exhibiting estrogenic activities. Post-USA-NTP studies investigated both human and animal reproductive and other physiological issues. These studies showed that estrogens can be either deleterious for reproduction and estrogen-dependent diseases, or beneficial for those with steroid deficiencies, that is more than 50. The specific outcome depends on exposure level and on the estrogenic status of the patients exposed. Recently, it was reported that, with the industrialization of soybean process, phytoestrogen exposure dramatically increased in both humans and cattle, whereas traditional Asian soy-food-processing empirically removed isoflavones. Phytoestrogen exposure has also become more widespread with the progressive internationalization of soybean use in human and cattle food.
Summary: Phytoestrogens should be considered as modern endocrine disruptors and studied as such.},

  abstract      = {Exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) is defined by a serum or plasma sodium concentration below the normal reference range of 135 mmol/L that occurs during or up to 24 hours after prolonged physical activity. It is reported to occur in individual physical activities or during organized endurance events conducted in austere environments in which medical care is limited and often not available, and patient evacuation to definitive care is often greatly delayed. Rapid recognition and appropriate treatment are essential in the severe form to ensure a positive outcome. Failure in this regard is a recognized cause of event-related fatality. In an effort to produce best practice guidelines for EAH in the austere environment, the Wilderness Medical Society convened an expert panel. The panel was charged with the development of evidence-based guidelines for management of EAH. Recommendations are made regarding the situations when sodium concentration can be assessed in the field and when these values are not known. These recommendations are graded on the basis of the quality of supporting evidence and balance between the benefits and risks/burdens for each parameter according to the methodology stipulated by the American College of Chest Physicians.

  abstract      = {Purpose Cell phone use has become more widespread over the past decade. Young adults are frequently early adopters of new technologies, including cell phones. Most previous research examining sexting, the act of sending sexually explicit or suggestive images via text message, has focused on the legal or social consequences of this behavior. The current study focused on the public health implications of sexting by examining associations between sexting, substance use, and sexual risk behavior in youth. Methods Young adults (N = 763) completed online questionnaires assessing demographics, cell phone use (e.g., texting, sexting), substance use, and sexual risk behaviors. Results Sexting was reported by a substantial minority of participants (44%). Compared with their nonsexting counterparts, participants who engaged in sexting were more likely to report recent substance use and high-risk sexual behaviors, including unprotected sex and sex with multiple partners. Of those who engaged in sexting, a considerable percentage (31.8%) reported having sex with a new partner for the first time after sexting with that person. In multivariate analyses, sexting was associated with high-risk sexual behavior, after accounting for demographic factors, total texting behaviors, and substance use. Conclusions Results suggest that sexting is robustly associated with high-risk sexual behavior. Many individuals exchange explicit or provocative photos with long-term sexual partners, but at least some participants in this study were incurring new sexual risks after sexting. Additional research is needed to understand the contexts in which sexting occurs, motivations for sexting, and relationship of sexting to risk behavior. },

When the intermediate variables involved are examined through the employment of a reproductive equation, it becomes clear that low fecundity is a major issue. Arguments offered previously to explain the low fertility of !Kung women, depending on factors such as nutrition, health status, and lactational practices are insufficient. Drawing upon recent data from sports medicine and endocrinology, I suggest that the pattern of San female energetics in their gathering and subsistence routine has a direct effect upon their fecundity. Such a correlation between activity patterns, endocrine function, and reproductive capacity may also be important for understanding the fertility of other mobile hunter-gatherer groups.},

  abstract      = {The recent extinction of grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) and wolves (Canis lupus) by humans from 95 to 99\% of the contiguous USA and Mexico in less than 100 years has resulted in dramatically altered and expanded prey communities. Such rampant ecological change and putative ecological instability has not occurred in North American northern boreal zones. This geographical variation in the loss of large carnivores as a consequence of anthropogenic disturbance offers opportunities for examining the potential consequences of extinction on subtle but important ecological patterns involving behaviour and interspecific ecological interactions. In Alaska, where scavengers and large carnivores are associated with carcasses, field experiments involving sound playback simulations have demonstrated that at least one prey species, moose (Alces alces), is sensitive to the vocalizations of ravens (Corvus corax) and may rely on their cues to avoid predation. However, a similar relationship is absent on a predator-free island in Alaska's Cook Inlet and at two sites in the Jackson Hole region of the Rocky Mountains (USA) where grizzly bears and wolves have been extinct for 50 to 70 years. While prior study of birds and mammals has demonstrated that prey may retain predator recognition capabilities for thousands of years even after predation as a selective force has been relaxed, the results presented here establish that a desensitization in interspecific responsiveness can also occur in less than ten generations. These results affirm (i) a rapid decoupling in behaviour involving prey and scavengers as a consequence of anthropogenic-caused predator¿prey disequilibriums, and (ii) subtle, community-level modifications in terrestrial ecosystems where large carnivores no longer exist. If knowledge about ecological and behavioural processes in extant systems is to be enhanced, the potential effects of recently extinct carnivores must be incorporated into current programmes.},

  abstract      = {The muscle glycogen content of the quadriceps femoris muscle was determined in 9 healthy subjects with the aid of the needle biopsy technique. The glycogen content could be varied in the individual subjects by instituting different diets after exhaustion of the glycogen store by hard exercise. Thus, the glycogen content after a fat ± protein (P) and a carbohydrate-rich (C) diet varied maximally from 0.6 g/100g muscle to 4.7 g. In all subjects, the glycogen content after the C diet was higher than the normal range for muscle glycogen, determined after the mixed (M) diet. After each diet period, the subjects worked on a bicycle ergometer at a work load corresponding to 75 per cent of their maximal O2 uptake, to complete exhaustion. The average work time was 59, 126 and 189 min after diets P, M and C, and a good correlation was noted between work time and the initial muscle glycogen content. The total carbohydrate utilization during the work periods (54–798 g) was well correlated to the decrease in glycogen content. It is therefore concluded that the glycogen content of the working muscle is a determinant for the capacity to perform long-term heavy exercise. Moreover, it has been shown that the glycogen content and, consequently, the long-term work capacity can be appreciably varied by instituting different diets after glycogen depletion.},

  abstract      = {Background: Lipid-lowering medications (LLMs) and especially statin drugs can delay cognitive decline and dementia onset in individuals with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at baseline. Methods: A longitudinal, observational study was con- ducted of 3069 cognitively healthy elderly patients ($75 years of age) who were en- rolled in the Ginkgo Evaluation of Memory Study. The primary outcome measure was the time to adjudicated all-cause dementia and Alzheimer dementia (AD). The secondary outcome measure was the change in global cognitive function over time measured by scores from the Modified Mini-Mental State Exam (3MSE) and the cog- nitive subscale of the AD Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog). Results: Among participants without MCI at baseline, the current use of statins was consistently associated with a re- duced risk of all-cause dementia (hazard ratio [HR], 0.79; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.65-0.96; P 5 .021) and AD (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.39-0.85; P 5 .005). In participants who initiated statin therapy, lipophilic statins tended to reduce dementia risk more than nonlipophilic agents. In contrast, there was no significant association between LLM use (including statins), dementia onset, or cognitive decline in individuals with baseline MCI. However, in individuals without MCI at baseline, there was a trend for a neuroprotective effect of statins on cognitive decline. Conclusions: Statins may slow the rate of cognitive decline and delay the onset of AD and all-cause dementia in cognitively healthy elderly individuals, whereas individuals with MCI may not have comparable cognitive protection from these agents. However, the results from this observational study need to be interpreted with caution and will require confirma- tion by randomized clinical trials stratifying treatment groups based on MCI status at baseline.

without malnutrition increases life span and delays the onset of a
variety of diseases in a wide range of animal species. However, the
mechanisms responsible for the retardation of aging with CR are
poorly understood. We proposed that CR may act, in part, by inducing
a hypometabolic state characterized by decreased reactive oxygen
species (ROS) production and mitochondrial proton leak. Here, we
examine the effects of long-term CR on whole animal energetics as
well as muscle mitochondrial energetics, ROS production, and ROS
damage. CR was initiated in male FBNF 1 rats at 6 mo of age and
continued for 12 or 18 mo. Mean whole body V̇ O 2 was 34.6 (P ⬍
0.01) and 35.6% (P ⬍ 0.001) lower in CR rats than in controls after
12 and 18 mo of CR, respectively. Body mass-adjusted V̇ O 2 was 11.1
and 29.5% lower (both P ⬍ 0.05) in CR rats than in controls after 12
and 18 mo of CR. Muscle mitochondrial leak-dependent (State 4)
respiration was decreased after 12 mo compared with controls; how-
ever, after 18 mo of CR, there were slight but not statistically
significant differences. Proton leak kinetics were affected by 12 mo of
CR such that leak-dependent respiration was lower in CR mitochon-
dria only at protonmotive force values exceeding 170 mV. Mitochon-
drial H 2 O 2 production and oxidative damage were decreased by CR at
both time points and increased with age. Muscle UCP3 protein content
increased with long-term CR, consistent with a role in protection from
ROS but inconsistent with the observed decrease or no change in
proton leak.},

ajpendo.00367.2003.—Reductions in cellular oxygen consumption
(V̇ O 2 ) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production have been
proposed as mechanisms underlying the anti-aging effects of calorie
restriction (CR). Mitochondria are a cell’s greatest “sink” for oxygen
and also its primary source of ROS. The mitochondrial proton leak
pathway is responsible for 20 –30% of V̇ O 2 in resting cells. We
hypothesized that CR leads to decreased proton leak with consequen-
tial decreases in V̇ O 2 , ROS production, and cellular damage. Here, we
report the effects of short-term (2-wk, 2-mo) and medium-term (6-mo)
CR (40%) on rat muscle mitochondrial proton leak, ROS production,
and whole animal V̇ O 2 . Whole body V̇ O 2 decreased with CR at all time
points, whereas mass-adjusted V̇ O 2 was normal until the 6-mo time
point, when it was 40% lower in CR compared with control rats. At all
time points, maximal leak-dependent V̇ O 2 was lower in CR rats compared
with controls. Proton leak kinetics indicated that mechanisms of
adaptation to CR were different between short- and medium-term
treatments, with the former leading to decreases in protonmotive force
(⌬p) and state 4 V̇ O 2 and the latter to increases in ⌬p and decreases in
state 4 V̇ O 2 . Results from metabolic control analyses of oxidative
phosphorylation are consistent with the idea that short- and medium-
term responses are distinct. Mitochondrial H 2 O 2 production was lower
in all three CR groups compared with controls. Overall, this study
details the rapid effects of short- and medium-term CR on proton leak,
ROS production, and metabolic control of oxidative phosphorylation.
Results indicate that a reduction in mitochondrial V̇ O 2 and ROS
production may be a mechanism for the actions of CR},

Recent and ancient evolutionary histories of unisexual Ambystoma were proposed by a few separate studies that constructed phylogenies using mitochondrial DNA markers (cytochrome b gene vs. non-coding region). In contrast to other studies showing that unisexual Ambystoma represent the most ancient unisexual vertebrates, a recent study by Robertson et al. suggests that this lineage has a very recent origin of less than 25,000 years ago.RESULTS:We re-examined the phylogenetic relationship of the unisexuals to A. barbouri from various populations using both mitochondrial markers as well as the complete mitochondrial genomes of A. barbouri and a unisexual individual from Kentucky. Lineage dating was conducted using BEAST and MultiDivTime on a complete mitochondrial genome phylogeny. Our results support a monophyletic lineage for unisexual Ambystoma that shares its most recent common ancestor with an A. barbouri lineage from western Kentucky. In contrast to the Robertson et al.'s study, no A. barbouri individual shared an identical or almost identical cytochrome b haplotype with any unisexual. Molecular dating supports an early Pliocene origin for the unisexual linage (~5 million years ago). We propose that a unisexual-like cytochrome b numt (or pseudogene) exists in the controversial A. barbouri individuals from Kentucky, which was likely the cause of an erroneous phylogeny and time estimate in Robertson et al.'s study.CONCLUSION:We reject a recent origin of unisexual Ambystoma and provide strong evidence that unisexual Ambystoma are the most ancient unisexual vertebrates known to exist. The likely presence of an ancient cytochrome b numt in some Kentucky A. barbouri represents a molecular "fossil" reinforcing the hypothesis that these individuals are some of the closest extant relatives to unisexual Ambystoma.},

While the total cell number of lower organisms is often known, it has not yet been defined in higher organisms. In particular, the reported total cell number of a human being ranges between 1012 and 1016 and it is widely mentioned without a proper reference.Aim: To study and discuss the theoretical issue of the total number of cells that compose the standard human adult organism.Subjects and methods: A systematic calculation of the total cell number of the whole human body and of the single organs was carried out using bibliographical and/or mathematical approaches.Results: A current estimation of human total cell number calculated for a variety of organs and cell types is presented. These partial data correspond to a total number of 3.72âÃâ1013.Conclusions: Knowing the total cell number of the human body as well as of individual organs is important from a cultural, biological, medical and comparative modelling point of view. The presented cell count could be a starting point for a common effort to complete the total calculation. },

Similar storage proteins exist as secalin in rye, hordein in barley, and avenins in oats and are collectively referred to as âgluten.â The objective was to discuss the biochemical and functional properties of the gluten proteins, including structure, sources, and dietary intakes. Literature was reviewed from food science and nutrition journals. The gluten protein networks vary because of different components and sizes, and variability caused by genotype, growing conditions, and technological processes. The structures and interactions of this matrix contribute to the unique properties of gluten. The resulting functions are essential to determining the dough quality of bread and other baked products. Gluten is heat stable and has the capacity to act as a binding and extending agent and is commonly used as an additive in processed foods for improved texture, moisture retention, and flavor. Gliadin contains peptide sequences that are highly resistant to gastric, pancreatic, and intestinal proteolytic digestion in the gastrointestinal tract. The average daily gluten intake in a Western diet is thought to be 5â20Â g/day and has been implicated in several disorders. Gluten containing grains (wheat, rye, barley, and oats) are important staple foods. Gluten is among the most complex protein networks and plays a key role in determining the rheological dough properties.},

  abstract      = {To function over a lifetime of use, materials and structures must be designed to have sufficient factors of safety to avoid failure. Vertebrates are generally built from materials having similar properties. Safety factors are most commonly calculated based on the ratio of a structure's failure stress to its peak operating stress. However, yield stress is a more likely limit, and work of fracture relative to energy absorption is likely the most relevant measure of a structure's safety factor, particularly under impact loading conditions characteristic of locomotion. Yet, it is also the most difficult to obtain. For repeated loading, fatigue damage and eventual failure may be critical to the design of biological structures and will result in lower safety factors. Although area:volume scaling predicts that stresses will increase with size, interspecific comparisons of mammals and birds show that skeletal allometry is modest, with most groups scaling (l{propto}d0.89) closer to geometric similarity (isometry: l {propto}d1.0) than to elastic similarity (l {propto}d0.67) or stress similarity (l {propto}d0.5). To maintain similar peak bone and muscle stresses, terrestrial mammals change posture when running, with larger mammals becoming more erect. More erect limbs increases their limb muscle mechanical advantage (EMA) or ratio of ground impulse to muscle impulse (r/R={int}G/{int}Fm). The increase in limb EMA with body weight ({propto}W0.25) allows larger mammals to match changes in bone and muscle area ({propto}W0.72-0.80) to changes in muscle force generating requirements ({propto}W0.75), keeping bone and muscle stresses fairly constant across a size range 0.04-300 kg. Above this size, extremely large mammals exhibit more pronounced skeletal allometry and reduced locomotor ability. Patterns of ontogenetic scaling during skeletal growth need not follow broader interspecific scaling patterns. Instead, negative allometric growth (becoming more slender) is often observed and may relate to maturation of the skeleton's properties or the need for younger animals to move at faster speeds compared with adults. In contrast to bone and muscle stress patterns, selection for uniform safety factors in tendons does not appear to occur. In addition to providing elastic energy savings, tendons transmit force for control of motion of more distal limb segments. Their role in elastic savings requires that some tendons operate at high stresses (and strains), which compromises their safety factor. Other `low stress' tendons have larger safety factors, indicating that their primary design is for stiffness to reduce the amount of stretch that their muscles must overcome when contracting to control movement.

  abstract      = {Muscular forces generated during locomotion depend on an animal's speed, gait, and size and underlie the energy demand to power locomotion. Changes in limb posture affect muscle forces by altering the mechanical advantage of the ground reaction force (R) and therefore the effective mechanical advantage (EMA = r/R, where r is the muscle mechanical advantage) for muscle force production. We used inverse dynamics based on force plate and kinematic recordings of humans as they walked and ran at steady speeds to examine how changes in muscle EMA affect muscle force-generating requirements at these gaits. We found a 68% decrease in knee extensor EMA when humans changed gait from a walk to a run compared with an 18% increase in hip extensor EMA and a 23% increase in ankle extensor EMA. Whereas the knee joint was extended (154-176{degrees}) during much of the support phase of walking, its flexed position (134-164{degrees}) during running resulted in a 5.2-fold increase in quadriceps impulse (time-integrated force during stance) needed to support body weight on the ground. This increase was associated with a 4.9-fold increase in the ground reaction force moment about the knee. In contrast, extensor impulse decreased 37% (P < 0.05) at the hip and did not change at the ankle when subjects switched from a walk to a run. We conclude that the decrease in limb mechanical advantage (mean limb extensor EMA) and increase in knee extensor impulse during running likely contribute to the higher metabolic cost of transport in running than in walking. The low mechanical advantage in running humans may also explain previous observations of a greater metabolic cost of transport for running humans compared with trotting and galloping quadrupeds of similar size.

  abstract      = {Debate over repealing the ivory trade ban dominates conferences of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Resolving this controversy requires accurate estimates of elephant population trends and rates of illegal killing. Most African savannah elephant populations are well known; however, the status of forest elephants, perhaps a distinct species, in the vast Congo Basin is unclear. We assessed population status and incidence of poaching from line-transect and reconnaissance surveys conducted on foot in sites throughout the Congo Basin. Results indicate that the abundance and range of forest elephants are threatened from poaching that is most intense close to roads. The probability of elephant presence increased with distance to roads, whereas that of human signs declined. At all distances from roads, the probability of elephant occurrence was always higher inside, compared to outside, protected areas, whereas that of humans was always lower. Inside protected areas, forest elephant density was correlated with the size of remote forest core, but not with size of protected area. Forest elephants must be prioritised in elephant management planning at the continental scale. Forest elephants, perhaps a distinct species of African elephant, occur in the forests of West and Central Africa. Compared to the more familiar savannah elephant of Eastern and Southern Africa, forest elephant biology and their conservation status are poorly known. To provide robust scientific data on the status and distribution of forest elephants to inform and guide conservation efforts, we conducted surveys on foot of forest elephant abundance and of illegal killing of elephants in important conservation sites throughout Central Africa. We covered a combined distance of over 8,000 km on reconnaissance walks, and we systematically surveyed a total area of some 60,000 km2 under the auspices of the Monitoring of the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) programme. Our results indicate that forest elephant numbers and range are severely threatened by hunting for ivory. Elephant abundance increased with increasing distance from the nearest road, and poaching pressure was most concentrated near roads. We found that protected areas have a positive impact on elephant abundance, probably because management interventions reduced poaching rates inside protected areas compared to non-protected forest. Law enforcement to bring the illegal ivory trade under control, and effective management and protection of large and remote national parks will be critical if forest elephants are to be successfully conserved.},

Moreover, the amplitude of this somatosensory activation was comparable to that for veridical stimulation including the intervening position on the arm. The illusion additionally activated areas of premotor and prefrontal cortex. These results provide direct evidence that illusory somatosensory percepts can affect primary somatosensory cortex in a manner that corresponds somatotopically to the illusory percept.},

  abstract      = {Although most researchers use the terms âguildâ and âfunctional groupâ more or less synonymously, these two concepts bear different meanings. The guild concept refers primarily to the mechanisms of resource sharing by species in a competitive context whereas the functional groups concept is concerned with how a resource or any other ecological component is processed by different species to provide a specific ecosystem service or function. In many cases but not necessarily all, the two concepts are the two âfacesâ or âsidesâ of the same coin: the sharing by species of a similar resource is the guild facet (structural), while the ecosystem processes these species eventually perform through resource exploitation is the functional group facet. The two concepts differ in that competitive relationships within groups of species are not the focus of the functional group approach, exactly as processes or functions are not the focus of the guild approach. A group of species can be considered either as a guild or a functional group depending on the question addressed. Guild and functional group membership is independent of phylogenetic relationships but because species tend to share similar life history traits and adaptations through common evolutionary history, guild and functional group associates are often closely related. The concept of guild has had broader application in animal studies than in plant studies, whereas the reverse is true for the concept of functional group. Recent methodological advances to objectively partition species into guilds and functional groups, taking into consideration the most relevant characters or traits for delineating them, provide the means to construct an operational framework for making in situ and ex situ experiments that are urgently needed for a better understanding of the role of species in ecosystem functioning, especially in relation to global change concerns.},

employee, NASDAQ-listed Chinese travel agency. Call center employees who volunteered to WFH
were randomly assigned either to work from home or in the office for 9 months. Home working led
to a 13% performance increase, of which 9% was from working more minutes per shift (fewer
breaks and sick days) and 4% from more calls per minute (attributed to a quieter and more
convenient working environment). Home workers also reported improved work satisfaction and
their attrition rate halved, but their promotion rate conditional on performance fell. Due to the
success of the experiment, Ctrip rolled out the option to WFH to the whole firm and allowed the
experimental employees to re-select between the home and office. Interestingly, over half of them
switched, which led to the gains from WFH almost doubling to 22%. This highlights the benefits of
learning and selection effects when adopting modern management practices like WFH.

  abstract      = {Refeeding syndrome (RFS) represents a group of clinical findings that occur in severely malnourished
individuals undergoing nutritional support. Cardiac arrhythmias, multisystem organ dysfunction, and
death are the most severe symptoms observed. As the cachectic body attempts to reverse its adaptation
to the starved state in response to the nutritional load, symptoms result from fluid and electrolyte imbalances,
with hypophosphatemia playing a central role. Because guidelines for feeding the malnourished
patient at risk for refeeding syndrome is scarce, we have provided management
recommendations based on the knowledge derived from a collection of reported English literature
cases of the RFS. A MEDLINE search using keywords including ‘‘refeeding syndrome,’’ ‘‘RFS,’’
and ‘‘refeeding hypophosphatemia’’ was performed. References from initial cases were utilized for
more literature on the subject. We have emphasized the continued importance of managing patients
at risk for RFS, compared how management of the severely malnourished patients have evolved
over time, and provided comprehensive clinical guidelines based on the sum of experience documented
in the case reports for the purpose of supplementing the guidelines available. Based on our
review, the most effective means of preventing or treating RFS were the following: recognizing the
patients at risk; providing adequate electrolyte, vitamin, and micronutrient supplementation; careful
fluid resuscitation; cautious and gradual energy restoration; and monitoring of critical laboratory
indices. 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

  abstract      = {Over the last few years, an increased awareness of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and their potential to affect wildlife and humans has produced a demand for practical screening methods to identify endocrine activity in a wide range of environmental and industrial chemicals. While it is clear that in vivo methods will be required to identify adverse effects produced by these chemicals, in vitro assays can define particular mechanisms of action and have the potential to be employed as rapid and low-cost screens for use in large scale EDC screening programs. Traditional estrogen receptor (ER) binding assays are useful for characterizing a chemical's potential to be an estrogen-acting EDC, but they involve displacement of a radioactive ligand from crude receptor preparations at low temperatures. The usefulness of these assays for realistically determining the ER binding interactions of weakly estrogenic environmental and industrial compounds that have low aqueous solubility is unclear. In this report, we present a novel fluorescence polarization (FP) method that measures the capacity of a competitor chemical to displace a high affinity fluorescent ligand from purified, recombinant human ER- alpha at room temperature. The ER- alpha binding interactions generated for 15 natural and synthetic compounds were found to be similar to those determined with traditional receptor binding assays. We also discuss the potential to employ this FP technology to binding studies involving ER-ß and other receptors. Thus, the assay introduced in this study is a nonradioactive receptor binding method that shows promise as a high throughput screening method for large-scale testing of environmental and industrial chemicals for ER binding interactions.

  abstract      = {Aim The purpose of this study was to determine the changes in running mechanics that occur when highly trained runners run barefoot and in a minimalist shoe, and specifically if running in a minimalist shoe replicates barefoot running. Methods Ground reaction force data and kinematics were collected from 22 highly trained runners during overground running while barefoot and in three shod conditions (minimalist shoe, racing flat and the athlete{\textquoteright}s regular shoe). Three-dimensional net joint moments and subsequent net powers and work were computed using Newton-Euler inverse dynamics. Joint kinematic and kinetic variables were statistically compared between barefoot and shod conditions using a multivariate analysis of variance for repeated measures and standardised mean differences calculated. Results There were significant differences between barefoot and shod conditions for kinematic and kinetic variables at the knee and ankle, with no differences between shod conditions. Barefoot running demonstrated less knee flexion during midstance, an 11\% decrease in the peak internal knee extension and abduction moments and a 24\% decrease in negative work done at the knee compared with shod conditions. The ankle demonstrated less dorsiflexion at initial contact, a 14\% increase in peak power generation and a 19\% increase in the positive work done during barefoot running compared with shod conditions. Conclusions Barefoot running was different to all shod conditions. Barefoot running changes the amount of work done at the knee and ankle joints and this may have therapeutic and performance implications for runners.},

  abstract      = {Objectives: To establish the relation between recurrent peer victimisation and onset of self reported symptoms of anxiety or depression in the early teen years. Design: Cohort study over two years. Setting: Secondary schools in Victoria, Australia. Participants: 2680 students surveyed twice in year 8 (aged 13 years) and once in year 9. Main outcome measures: Self reported symptoms of anxiety or depression were assessed by using the computerised version of the revised clinical interview schedule. Incident cases were students scoring [&gt;=]12 in year 9 but not previously. Prior victimisation was defined as having been bullied at either or both survey times in year 8. Results: Prevalence of victimisation at the second survey point in year 8 was 51\% (95\% confidence interval 49\% to 54\%), and prevalence of self reported symptoms of anxiety or depression was 18\% (16\% to 20\%). The incidence of self reported symptoms of anxiety or depression in year 9 (7\%) was significantly associated with victimisation reported either once (odds ratio 1.94, 1.1 to 3.3) or twice (2.30, 1.2 to 4.3) in year 8. After adjustment for availability of social relations and for sociodemographic factors, recurrent victimisation remained predictive of self reported symptoms of anxiety or depression for girls (2.60, 1.2 to 5.5) but not for boys (1.36, 0.6 to 3.0). Newly reported victimisation in year 9 was not significantly associated with prior self report of symptoms of anxiety or depression (1.48, 0.4 to 6.0). Conclusion: A history of victimisation and poor social relationships predicts the onset of emotional problems in adolescents. Previous recurrent emotional problems are not significantly related to future victimisation. These findings have implications for how seriously the occurrence of victimisation is treated and for the focus of interventions aimed at addressing mental health issues in adolescents. What is already known on this topic Being bullied is a common experience for many young people Victimisation is related to depression and, to a lesser extent, anxiety, loneliness, and general self esteem Debate remains as to whether victimisation precedes the onset of emotional problems or whether young people with emotional problems "invite" victimisation What this study adds A history of victimisation predicts the onset of anxiety or depression, especially in adolescent girls Previous recurrent emotional problems are not significantly related to future victimisation Reduction in bullying in schools could have a substantial impact on the emotional wellbeing of young people },

substrate for muscle contraction, the knowledge about this

of cell metabolism revolve around ATP production and
consumption. It is important to understand the concepts of
glucose and oxygen consumption in aerobic and anaerobic
life and to link bioenergetics with the vast amount of reactions
occurring within cells. ATP is universally seen as the
energy exchange factor that connects anabolism and catabolism
but also fuels processes such as motile contraction,
phosphorylations, and active transport. It is also a signalling
molecule in the purinergic signalling mechanisms. In this
review, we will discuss all the main mechanisms of ATP
production linked to ADP phosphorylation as well the regulation
of these mechanisms during stress conditions and in
connection with calcium signalling events. Recent advances
regarding ATP storage and its special significance for purinergic
signalling will also be reviewed.

The cause of the conspicuous differences in the understory vegetation and the herbivoreâpredator cycles between northwestern Europe and western North America presents an enigma. Ericaceous dwarf shrubs and 3â to 4-year voleâmustelid cycles characterize the European boreal forests, whereas tall deciduous shrubs and 10-year snowshoe hareâlynx cycles characterize the North American ones. We discuss plausible explanations for this difference and conclude that it is bottom-up: Winter climate is the key determinant of the dominant understory vegetation that then determines the herbivoreâpredator food-web interactions. The crucial unknown for the twenty-first century is how climate change and increasing instability will affect these forests, both with respect to the dynamics of individual plant and animal species and to their community interactions.},

Such ratings are important complements to behavioral and physiological measurements of physical performance and work capacity. This is true for both theoretical analysis and application in medicine, human factors, and sports. Perceptual estimates, obtained by psychophysical ratio-scaling methods, are valid when describing general perceptual variation, but category methods are more useful in several applied situations when differences between individuals are described. A presentation is made of ratio-scaling methods, category methods, especially the Borg Scale for ratings of perceived exertion, and a new method that combines the category method with ratio properties.

Prior efforts have built a knowledge base of effective undergraduate STEM pedagogies, yet rates of implementation remain low. Theories from higher education, management, communication, and other fields can inform change efforts but remain largely inaccessible to STEM education leaders, who are just beginning to view change as a scholarly endeavor informed by the research literature.

Purpose
This article describes the goals, assumptions, and underlying logic of selected change strategies with potential relevance to STEM higher education settings for a target audience of change agents, leaders, and researchers.

Scope/Method
This review is organized according to the Four Categories of Change Strategies model developed by Henderson, Beach, and Finkelstein (2011). We describe eight strategies of potential practical relevance to STEM education change efforts (two from each category). For each change strategy, we present a summary with key references, discuss their applicability to STEM higher education, provide a STEM education example, and discuss implications for change efforts and research.

Conclusions
Change agents are guided, often implicitly, by a single change strategy. These eight strategies will expand the repertoire of change agents by helping them consider change from a greater diversity of perspectives. Change agents can use these descriptions to design more robust change efforts. Improvements in the knowledge and theory base underlying change strategies will occur when change agents situate their writing about change initiatives using shared models, such as the one presented in this article, to make their underlying assumptions about change more explicit.},

  abstract      = {Soil organic matter quality in the sense of how easily carbon in the soil organic matter can be mineralised is a major determinant of soil carbon storage and rate of mineralisation of nutrients. Its origin has so far remained elusive and a number of indices, such as C-to-N-ratio, lignin concentration and other combinations of chemical constituents have been used as substitutes for quality. We suggest here that quality is the number of enzymatic steps required to release as carbon dioxide a carbon atom from an organic compound. The larger the number of steps the lower is the quality of the carbon atom. Such a measure connects quality to thermodynamics. It also explains the rapid decrease in decomposition rate with decreasing quality suggested in the q-theory of organic matter dynamics and shows that the decomposition rate of low quality substrates has a stronger temperature dependence than that of high quality substrates.},

Among 558 middle school students surveyed in 1995, only 20\% reported no bullying behavior. In multiple regression analysis, misconduct anger beliefs supportive of violence, confidence in using nonviolent strategies, and intentions to use nonviolent strategies were associated with levels of bullying behavior. Although boys reported more bullying behavior than did girls, gender was nota significant predictor in the multiple regression analysis. These study results were inconsistent with the perspective that early adolescents were either bullies or nonbullies and indicated the need for a comprehensive approach to preventing bullying behavior.

  abstract      = {Urine has long been a âfavoredâ biofluid among metabolomics researchers. It is sterile, easy-to-obtain in large volumes, largely free from interfering proteins or lipids and chemically complex. However, this chemical complexity has also made urine a particularly difficult substrate to fully understand. As a biological waste material, urine typically contains metabolic breakdown products from a wide range of foods, drinks, drugs, environmental contaminants, endogenous waste metabolites and bacterial by-products. Many of these compounds are poorly characterized and poorly understood. In an effort to improve our understanding of this biofluid we have undertaken a comprehensive, quantitative, metabolome-wide characterization of human urine. This involved both computer-aided literature mining and comprehensive, quantitative experimental assessment/validation. The experimental portion employed NMR spectroscopy, gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS), direct flow injection mass spectrometry (DFI/LC-MS/MS), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) experiments performed on multiple human urine samples. This multi-platform metabolomic analysis allowed us to identify 445 and quantify 378 unique urine metabolites or metabolite species. The different analytical platforms were able to identify (quantify) a total of: 209 (209) by NMR, 179 (85) by GC-MS, 127 (127) by DFI/LC-MS/MS, 40 (40) by ICP-MS and 10 (10) by HPLC. Our use of multiple metabolomics platforms and technologies allowed us to identify several previously unknown urine metabolites and to substantially enhance the level of metabolome coverage. It also allowed us to critically assess the relative strengths and weaknesses of different platforms or technologies. The literature review led to the identification and annotation of another 2206 urinary compounds and was used to help guide the subsequent experimental studies. An online database containing the complete set of 2651 confirmed human urine metabolite species, their structures (3079 in total), concentrations, related literature references and links to their known disease associations are freely available at http://www.urinemetabolome.ca.},

The older participants also provided peer nominations of classmates thought to be bullies and victims. Significant differences between pupils from the two countries, between younger and older pupils, and between girls and boys emerged on a number of these variables. For example, a significantly larger percentage of English pupils than Swedish pupils indicated that name calling is bullying, whereas the reverse was true for leaving somebody out. These results suggest that findings concerning incidence of, and beliefs about, bullying may not generalise from one group of pupils to another. Overall, participants tended to express anti-bullying attitudes. The present results also add to the small but growing set of findings which suggest that pupils' attitudes concerning bullying and their actual involvement in bullying are associated concurrently. Attitudes were found to significantly predict involvement in bullying even after the variance shared with participants' sex had been controlled. Specifically, those pupils that expressed the weakest anti-bullying attitudes were found to be most often nominated by peers as a bully. The implications of these results for anti-bullying interventions were discussed. C1 Univ Keele, Dept Psychol, Keele ST5 5BG, Staffs, England.},

Background
Gastrointestinal illness is a common risk for wilderness travelers, even among those who consistently disinfect their water, yet the importance of hygiene has not been characterized.

Methods
In a prospective surveillance study, 334 Appalachian Trail backpackers who hiked for at least 7 days in 1997 were interviewed. Upon completion of their hike, a written questionnaire was sent, addressing illnesses, water disinfection methods, and hygiene. Hygiene inquiries focused on the frequency of behaviors concerning handwashing and cleaning cookware.

Results
Two hundred and eighty backpackers compiled 38, 940 wilderness exposure days, with 56% (n= 156) experiencing diarrhea. Diarrhea correlated with the frequency of drinking untreated surface water (relative risk (RR) 2.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0–4.7%, p =.03). Of those who consistently treated water, 45% suffered from diarrhea, whereas 69% of those who inconsistently treated water experienced diarrhea (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.53–0.81%, p =.001). Hikers practicing “good hygiene”, defined as handwashing postdefecation and cleaning cookware routinely, were less likely to ever experience diarrhea (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.22–0.99, p =.04). Routine handwashing with soap and water after both urination and defecation reduced the risk of diarrhea (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.04–0.31%, p <.001). In a case-control analysis of those experiencing diarrhea, decreased diarrhea was associated with routine consumption of multivitamins (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.37–0.66%, p <.001), routine cleaning of utensils with warm, soapy water (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.20–0.74%, p <.01), and postdefecation handwashing with soap and water (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.39–0.93%, p =.006).

Conclusions
Lack of hygiene, specifically handwashing and cleaning of cookware, should be recognized as a significant contributor to wilderness gastrointestinal illness. Hikers should routinely disinfect water and avoid untreated surface water.},

  abstract      = {Purpose We sought to determine the extent to which injuries and illnesses limit long-distance or endurance outdoor recreational activities. Methods In a prospective surveillance study, 334 persons who hiked the Appalachian Trail for at least 7 days (mean [Â± SD] length of hike, 140 Â± 60 days) in 1997 were interviewed. At the end of their hike, subjects completed a questionnaire on injuries, illnesses, water purification methods, and hygiene practices. Results Of the 280 backpackers who responded (a combined 38,940 days of wilderness exposure), 69% (n = 192) achieved their goal. The most important reasons for ending a hike prematurely were injury, time limitation, and psychosocial reasons. The most common medical complaints were feet blisters (64%; n = 180), diarrhea (56%, n = 156), skin irritation (51%, n = 143), and acute joint pain (36%, n = 102). The incidence of vector-borne disease was 4% (n = 11); physician-diagnosed Lyme disease was the most common, and 24% of hikers (n = 68) reported tick bites. The risk of diarrhea was greater among those who frequently drank untreated water from streams or ponds (odds ratio [OR] = 7.7; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.7 to 23; P &lt;0.0001), whereas practicing âgood hygieneâ (defined as routine cleaning of cooking utensils and cleaning hands after bowel movements) was associated with a decreased risk (OR = 0.46; 95% CI: 0.22 to 0.97; P =0.04). Conclusion Diarrhea is the most common illness limiting long-distance hikers. Hikers should purify water routinely, avoiding using untreated surface water. The risk of gastrointestinal illness can also be reduced by maintaining personal hygiene practices and cleaning cookware. },

Our results show that phones’ chemistries reflect a personalized lifestyle profile. The collective repertoire of molecules found on these objects provides a sketch of the lifestyle of an individual by highlighting the type of hygiene/beauty products the person uses, diet, medical status, and even the location where this person may have been. These findings introduce an additional form of trace evidence from skin-associated lifestyle chemicals found on personal belongings.

  abstract      = {In the oceans, ubiquitous microscopic phototrophs (phytoplankton) account for approximately half the production of organic
matter on Earth. Analyses of satellite-derived phytoplankton concentration (available since 1979) have suggested
decadal-scale fluctuations linked to climate forcing, but the length of this record is insufficient to resolve longer-term trends.
Here we combine available ocean transparency measurements and in situ chlorophyll observations to estimate the time
dependence of phytoplankton biomass at local, regional and global scales since 1899. We observe declines in eight out of ten
ocean regions, and estimate a global rate of decline of ,1% of the global median per year. Our analyses further reveal
interannual to decadal phytoplankton fluctuations superimposed on long-term trends. These fluctuations are strongly
correlated with basin-scale climate indices, whereas long-term declining trends are related to increasing sea surface
temperatures. We conclude that global phytoplankton concentration has declined over the past century; this decline will
need to be considered in future studies of marine ecosystems, geochemical cycling, ocean circulation and fisheries.},

  abstract      = {Abstract Background Some human and animal studies have recently shown that maternal grandmother's smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of asthma in the grandchildren. We have investigated whether sex of the exposed parent and/or grandchild modifies the association between grandmaternal smoking and grandchild asthma. Methods We formed a cohort study based on linkage of national registries with prospectively collected data over three generations. Smoking habits in early pregnancy were registered since 1982 and purchases of prescribed medication since 2005. In all, 10Â 329 children born since 2005 had information on maternal and grandmaternal smoking on both sides and were followed from birth up to 6Â years of age. Ages when medication was purchased were used to classify the cohort into never, early transient (0â3Â years), early persistent (0â3 and 4â6Â years), and lateâonset (4â6Â years) phenotypes of childhood asthma. Results Maternal grandmother's smoking was associated with an increased odds of early persistent asthma after adjustment for maternal smoking and other confounders (odds ratio 1.29, 95\% confidence interval 1.10â1.51). Grandchild sex did not modify the association. Paternal grandmother's smoking was not associated with any of the asthma phenotypes. Conclusion Maternal but not paternal exposure to nicotine before conception was related to an increased risk of early persistent childhood asthma, but not other asthma phenotypes. Our findings are possibly consistent with a sexâspecific mode of epigenetic transfer.},

  abstract      = {Acquisition of stable arsenic tolerance in human cells following chronic arsenic exposure has not been previously reported. In the present work, we describe acquisition of stable arsenic tolerance in the human prostate epithelial cell line RWPE-1 following chronic arsenic exposure in vitro. RWPE-1 cells continuously exposed to 5 Î¼M sodium arsenite for â¥18 weeks exhibited dramatic resistance to acute arsenite toxicity. The LC50 for acute arsenite exposure in these chronic arsenic-exposed prostate epithelial (CAsE-PE) cells was 43.8 Î¼M versus 17.6 Î¼M in control cells. Similar results were obtained using the antineoplastic agent arsenic trioxide. This tolerance was stable, as CAsE-PE cells grown in arsenic-free medium for 5 weeks retained their resistant phenotype. Compared to control cells, CAsE-PE cells showed a 90% reduction in arsenic accumulation over 24 h coupled with a 2.6-fold increase in the rate of arsenic efflux. CAsE-PE cells had increased basal GSH levels (4.9-fold) and increased GST activity (2.4-fold) and both GSH depletion and inhibition of GST activity abolished arsenic tolerance. Arsenic tolerance was also abolished by treatment with inhibitors of the Mdr1 and Mrp1 transporters, although no increases in mdr1 or mrp1 gene expression were observed. Our results indicate that this tolerance in human cells involves increases in GSH levels and GST activity that allow for more efficient arsenic efflux by MRP1 and MDR1. This study represents the first report of stable acquired arsenic tolerance in human cells, which could have important implications for both the toxicology and the pharmacology of arsenic.},

Most subsequent attine agricultural evolution, including the domestication event that produced the ancestor of higher attine cultivars, is likewise hypothesized to have occurred in South American rainforests. The {\textquoteleft}out-of-the-rainforest{\textquoteright} hypothesis, while generally accepted, has never been tested in a phylogenetic context. It also presents a problem for explaining how fungal domestication might have occurred, given that isolation from free-living populations is required. Here, we use phylogenomic data from ultra-conserved element (UCE) loci to reconstruct the evolutionary history of fungus-farming ants, reduce topological uncertainty, and identify the closest non-fungus-growing ant relative. Using the phylogeny we infer the history of attine agricultural systems, habitat preference and biogeography. Our results show that the out-of-the-rainforest hypothesis is correct with regard to the origin of attine ant agriculture; however, contrary to expectation, we find that the transition from lower to higher agriculture is very likely to have occurred in a seasonally dry habitat, inhospitable to the growth of free-living populations of attine fungal cultivars. We suggest that dry habitats favoured the isolation of attine cultivars over the evolutionary time spans necessary for domestication to occur.},

Methods Three-dimensional hammer head positional data were measured and used to calculate linear speed (calculated speed) and cable force. These data were used to develop two linear regression models (shifted and non-shifted) that would allow prediction of hammer speed from measured cable force data (predicted speed). The accuracy of the two models was assessed by comparing the predicted and calculated speeds. Averages of the coefficient of multiple correlation (CMC) and the root mean square (RMS) of the difference between the predicted and calculated speeds for each throw of each participant were used to assess the level of accuracy of the predicted speeds. Results Both regression models had high \{CMC\} values (0.96 and 0.97) and relatively low \{RMS\} values (1.27Â m/s and 1.05Â m/s) for the non-shifted and shifted models, respectively. In addition, the average percentage differences between the predicted and calculated speeds were 6.6% and 4.7% for the non-shifted and shifted models, respectively. The \{RMS\} differences between release speeds attained via the two regression models and those attained via three-dimensional positional data were also computed. The \{RMS\} differences between the predicted and calculated release speeds were 0.69Â m/s and 0.46Â m/s for the non-shifted and shifted models, respectively. Conclusion This study successfully derived and validated a method that allows prediction of linear hammer speed from directly measured cable force data. Two linear regression models were developed and it was found that either model would be capable of predicting accurate speeds. However, data predicted using the shifted regression model were more accurate. },

Our aim was to evaluate the association between the ability to sit and rise from the floor and all-cause mortality.Design:Retrospective cohort.Methods:2002 adults aged 51â80 years (68\% men) performed a sitting-rising test (SRT) to and from the floor, which was scored from 0 to 5, with one point being subtracted from 5 for each support used (hand/knee). Final SRT score, varying from 0 to 10, was obtained by adding sitting and rising scores and stratified in four categories for analysis: 0â3; 3.5â5.5, 6â7.5, and 8â10.Results:Median follow up was 6.3 years and there were 159 deaths (7.9\%). Lower SRT scores were associated with higher mortality (pâ<â0.001). A continuous trend for longer survival was reflected by multivariate-adjusted (age, sex, body mass index) hazard ratios of 5.44 (95\% CI 3.1â9.5), 3.44 (95\% CI 2.0â5.9), and 1.84 (95\% CI 1.1â3.0) (pâ<â0.001) from lower to higher SRT scores. Each unit increase in SRT score conferred a 21\% improvement in survival.Conclusions:Musculoskeletal fitness, as assessed by SRT, was a significant predictor of mortality in 51â80-year-old subjects. Application of a simple and safe assessment tool such as SRT, which is influenced by muscular strength and flexibility, in general health examinations could add relevant information regarding functional capabilities and outcomes in non-hospitalized adults. },

  abstract      = {The study of animal behaviour is important for both ecology and ecotoxicol-
ogy, yet research in these two fields is currently developing independently.
Here, we synthesize the available knowledge on drug-induced behavioural
alterations in fish, discuss potential ecological consequences and report results
from an experiment in which we quantify both uptake and behavioural impact
of a psychiatric drug on a predatory fish (Perca fluviatilis) and its invertebrate
prey (Coenagrion hastulatum). We show that perch became more active while
damselfly behaviour was unaffected, illustrating that behavioural effects of
pharmaceuticals can differ between species. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that prey consumption can be an important exposure route as on average
46% of the pharmaceutical in ingested prey accumulated in the predator.
This suggests that investigations of exposure through bioconcentration,
where trophic interactions and subsequent bioaccumulation of exposed
individuals are ignored, underestimate exposure. Wildlife may therefore be
exposed to higher levels of behaviourally altering pharmaceuticals than
predictions based on commonly used exposure assays and pharmaceutical
concentrations found in environmental monitoring programmes.},

  abstract      = {This review summarizes the brain mechanisms controlling sleep and wakefulness. Wakefulness promoting systems cause low-voltage, fast activity in the electroencephalogram (EEG). Multiple interacting neurotransmitter systems in the brain stem, hypothalamus, and basal forebrain converge onto common effector systems in the thalamus and cortex. Sleep results from the inhibition of wake-promoting systems by homeostatic sleep factors such as adenosine and nitric oxide and GABAergic neurons in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus, resulting in large-amplitude, slow EEG oscillations. Local, activity-dependent factors modulate the amplitude and frequency of cortical slow oscillations. Non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep results in conservation of brain energy and facilitates memory consolidation through the modulation of synaptic weights. Rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep results from the interaction of brain stem cholinergic, aminergic, and GABAergic neurons which control the activity of glutamatergic reticular formation neurons leading to REM sleep phenomena such as muscle atonia, REMs, dreaming, and cortical activation. Strong activation of limbic regions during REM sleep suggests a role in regulation of emotion. Genetic studies suggest that brain mechanisms controlling waking and NREM sleep are strongly conserved throughout evolution, underscoring their enormous importance for brain function. Sleep disruption interferes with the normal restorative functions of NREM and REM sleep, resulting in disruptions of breathing and cardiovascular function, changes in emotional reactivity, and cognitive impairments in attention, memory, and decision making.},

Method: Clinical and biochemical data of 78 patients with AADC deficiency were tabulated in a database of pediatric neurotransmitter disorders (JAKE). A total of 46 patients have been previously reported; 32 patients are described for the first time. Results: In 96% of AADC-deficient patients, symptoms (hypotonia 95%, oculogyric crises 86%, and developmental retardation 63%) became clinically evident during infancy or childhood. Laboratory diagnosis is based on typical CSF markers (low homovanillic acid, 5-hydroxyindoleacidic acid, and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenolglycole, and elevated 3-O-methyl-L-dopa, L-dopa, and 5-hydroxytryptophan), absent plasma AADC activity, or elevated urinary vanillactic acid. A total of 24 mutations in the DDC gene were detected in 49 patients (8 reported for the first time: p.L38P, p.Y79C, p.A110Q, p.G123R, p.I42fs, c.876GA, p.R412W, p.I433fs) with IVS6 4AT being the most common one (allele frequency 45%). Conclusion: Based on clinical symptoms, CSF neurotransmitters profile is highly indicative for the diagnosis of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency. Treatment options are limited, in many cases not beneficial, and prognosis is uncertain. Only 15 patients with a relatively mild form clearly improved on a combined therapy with pyridoxine (B6)/pyridoxal phosphate, dopamine agonists, and monoamine oxidase B inhibitors.},

  abstract      = {Intraspecific group hunting has received considerable attention because of the close links between cooperative behaviour and its cognitive demands. Accordingly, comparisons between species have focused on behaviours that can potentially distinguish between the different levels of cognitive complexity involved, such as ?intentional? communication between partners in order to initiate a joint hunt, the adoption of different roles during a joint hunt (whether consistently or alternately), and the level of food sharing following a successful hunt. Here we report field observations from the Red Sea on the highly coordinated and communicative interspecific hunting between the grouper, Plectropomus pessuliferus, and the giant moray eel, Gymnothorax javanicus. We provide evidence of the following: (1) associations are nonrandom, (2) groupers signal to moray eels in order to initiate joint searching and recruit moray eels to prey hiding places, (3) signalling is dependent on grouper hunger level, and (4) both partners benefit from the association. The benefits of joint hunting appear to be due to complementary hunting skills, reflecting the evolved strategies of each species, rather than individual role specialisation during joint hunts. In addition, the partner species that catches a prey item swallows it whole immediately, making aggressive monopolisation of a carcass impossible. We propose that the potential for monopolisation of carcasses by one partner species represents the main constraint on the evolution of interspecific cooperative hunting for most potentially suitable predator combinations.},

While we expect this to strongly influence the short-time diffusion coefficient Ds of proteins on length scales comparable to the nearest-neighbor distance, this quantity is difficult to assess experimentally. We demonstrate that quantitative information about Ds can be obtained from quasi-elastic neutron scattering experiments using the neutron spin echo technique. We choose two well-characterized and highly stable eye lens proteins, bovine Î±-crystallin and Î³B-crystallin, and measure their diffusion at concentrations comparable to those present in the eye lens. While diffusion slows down with increasing concentration for both proteins, we find marked variations that are directly linked to subtle differences in their interaction potentials. A comparison with computer simulations shows that anisotropic and patchy interactions play an essential role in determining the local short-time dynamics. Hence, our study clearly demonstrates the enormous effect that weak attractions can have on the short-time diffusion of proteins at concentrations comparable to those in the cellular cytosol.},

Nine volunteer men were asked to walk outside for 40 min and then to drive a car for 160 min. Scrotal temperatures were measured from thermocouples and values recorded every 2 min on a portable data recorder. Scrotal temperature increased significantly (P < 0.0001) in driving posture after 2 h of driving, reaching a value 1.7-2.2{degrees}C higher than that recorded while walking. This link between driving position and increased scrotal temperature indicates a potential exposure of male reproductive function to lifestyle factors.

  abstract      = {A popular theory has proposed that anisogamy originated through disruptive selection acting on an ancestral isogamous population, though recent work has emphasized the importance of other factors in its evolution. We re{\textendash}examine the disruptive selection theory, starting from an isogamous population with two mating types and taking into account the functional relationship, g(m), between the fitness of a gamete and its size, m, as well as the relationship, f(S), between the fitness of a zygote and its size, S. Evolutionary game theory is used to determine the existence and continuous stability of isogamous and anisogamous strategies for the two mating types under various models for the two functions g(m) and f(S). In the ancestral unicellular state, these two functions are likely to have been similar; this leads to isogamy whether they are sigmoidal or concave, though in the latter case allowance must be made for a minimal gamete size. The development of multicellularity may leave g(m) relatively unchanged while f(S) moves to the right, leading to the evolution of anisogamy. Thus, the disruptive selection theory provides a powerful explanation of the origin of anisogamy, though other selective forces may have been involved in the subsequent specialization of micro{\textendash} and macrogametes.},

Nineteen guano samples and three feathers were collected from 13 Gyrfalcon nests with stratified faecal accumulation in central-west and northwest Greenland. Samples were 14 C dated, with the oldest guano sample dating to c. 2740–2360 calendar years (cal yr) before present (BP) and three others were probably > 1000 cal yr BP. Feather samples ranged from 670 to 60 cal yr BP. Although the estimated age of material was correlated with sample depth, both sample depth and guano thickness gave a much less reliable prediction of sample age than use of radiocarbon dating on which the margin of error was less. Older samples were obtained from sites farther from the current Greenland Ice Sheet and at higher elevations, while younger samples were closer to the current ice sheet and at lower elevations. Values for d 13 C showed that Gyrfalcons nesting farther from the Greenland Ice Sheet had a more marine diet, whereas those nesting closer to the ice sheet (= further inland) fed on a more terrestrial diet. The duration of nest-site use by Gyrfalcons is a probable indicator of both the time at which colonization occurred and the palaeoenvironmental conditions and patterns of glacial retreat. Nowhere before has such extreme long-term to present use of raptor nest-sites been documented. Keywords: carbon dating, guano, palaeoenvironmental conditions, d 13 C.},

Rates of speciation were estimated by considering the number of living species in each genus and the fossil record of each genus as well as information about extinction rates. Speciation rate was strongly correlated with rate of chromosomal evolution and average rates of speciation in lower vertebrate genera were one-fifth those in mammalian genera. Genera with high karyotypic diversity and rapid speciation rates may generally have small effective population size (N3), whereas large Ne values may be associated with karyotypically uniform genera and slow rates of speciation. Speciation and chromosomal evolution seem fastest in those genera with species organized into clans or harems (e.g., some primates and horses) or with limited adult vagility and juvenile dispersal, patchy distribution, and strong individual territoriality (e.g., some rodents). This is consistent with the above hypothesis regarding the evolutionary importance of demes.

Two experiments investigated how the type and timing of feedback influence learning from a multiple-choice test. First, participants read 12 prose passages, which covered various general knowledge topics (e.g., The Sun) and ranged between 280 and 300 words in length. Next, they took an initial six-alternative, multiple-choice test on information contained in the passages. Feedback was given immediately for some of the multiple-choice items or after delay for other items. Participants were either shown the correct answer as feedback (standard feedback) or were allowed to keep answering until the correct answer was discovered (answer-until-correct feedback). Learning from the test was assessed on a delayed cued-recall test. The results indicated that delayed feedback led to superior final test performance relative to immediate feedback. However, type of feedback did not matter: discovering the correct answer through answer-until-correct feedback produced equivalent performance relative to standard feedback. This research suggests that delaying the presentation of feedback after a test is beneficial to learning because of the spaced presentation of information.

We explain and develop a method based on the OrnsteinâUhlenbeck (OU) process, first proposed by Hansen. OrnsteinâUhlenbeck models incorporate both selection and drift and are thus qualitatively different from, and more general than, pure drift models based on Brownian motion. Most importantly, OU models possess selective optima that formalize the notion of adaptive zone. In this article, we develop the method for one quantitative character, discuss interpretations of its parameters, and provide code implementing the method. Our approach allows us to translate hypotheses regarding adaptation in different selective regimes into explicit models, to test the models against data using maximumâlikelihoodâbased model selection techniques, and to infer details of the evolutionary process. We illustrate the method using two worked examples. Relative to existing approaches, the direct modeling approach we demonstrate allows one to explore more detailed hypotheses and to utilize more of the information content of comparative data sets than existing methods. Moreover, the use of a model selection framework to simultaneously compare a variety of hypotheses advances our ability to assess alternative evolutionary explanations. },

  abstract      = {D-beta-hydroxybutyrate, the principal "ketone" body in starving man, displaces glucose as the predominating fuel for brain, decreasing the need for glucose synthesis in liver (and kidney) and accordingly spares its precursor, muscle-derived amino acids. Thus normal 70 kg. man survives 2-3 months of starvation instead of several weeks, and obese man many months to over a year. Without this metabolic adaptation, H. sapiens could not have evolved such a large brain. Recent studies have shown that D-beta-hydroxybutyrate, the principal "ketone", is not just a fuel, but a "superfuel" more efficiently producing ATP energy than glucose or fatty acid. In a perfused rat heart preparation, it increased contractility and decreased oxygen consumption. It has also protected neuronal cells in tissue culture against exposure to toxins associated with Alzheimer's or Parkinson's. In a rodent model it decreased the death of lung cells induced by hemorrhagic shock. Also, mice exposed to hypoxia survived longer. These and other data suggest a potential use of beta-hydroxybutyrate in a number of medical and non-medical conditions where oxygen supply or substrate utilization may be limited. Efforts are underway to prepare esters of beta-hydroxybutyrate which can be taken orally or parenterally to study its potential therapeutic applications. IMAGES:},

 Abstract This article, which is partly biographical and partly scientific, summarizes a life in academic medicine. It relates my progress from benchside to bedside and then to academic and research administration, and concludes with the teaching of human biology to college undergraduates. My experience as an intern (anno 1953) treating a youngster in diabetic ketoacidosis underscored our ignorance of the controls in human fuel metabolism. Circulating free fatty acids were then unknown, insulin could not be measured in biologic fluids, and β-hydroxybutyric acid, which was difficult to measure, was considered by many a metabolic poison. The central role of insulin and the metabolism of free fatty acids, glycerol, glucose, lactate, and pyruvate, combined with indirect calorimetry, needed characterization in a near-steady state, namely prolonged starvation. This is the main topic of this chapter. Due to its use by brain, D-β-hydroxybutyric acid not only has permitted man to survive prolonged starvation, but also may have therapeutic potential owing to its greater efficiency in providing cellular energy in ischemic states such as stroke, myocardial insufficiency, neonatal stress, genetic mitochondrial problems, and physical fatigue.},

M{\r{a}}nga g{\r{a}}r direkt till korvmojen eller falafelst{\"{a}}llet efter en helkv{\"{a}}ll ute. Men varf{\"{o}}r blir man egentligen hungrig. Det finns ju gott om energi i alkoholen, s{\r{a}} man borde ju vara m{\"{a}}tt?
Effekten av att hungern smyger sig p{\r{a}} n{\"{a}}r man har druckit alkohol {\"{a}}r k{\"{a}}nd sedan tidigare. Nu visar en ny studie att alkohol aktiverar celler i hj{\"{a}}rnan som g{\"{o}}r att vi blir hungriga, trots att alkohol {\"{a}}r v{\"{a}}ldigt rikt p{\r{a}} energi.

– Det som {\"{a}}r speciellt med alkohol, eller etanol som det egentligen handlar om, {\"{a}}r att det inte finns n{\r{a}}gon specifik receptor som tar hand om det i hj{\"{a}}rnan. Likv{\"{a}}l s{\"{a}}tter det ig{\r{a}}ng den h{\"{a}}r hungersignalen, s{\"{a}}ger Helgi Schi{\"{o}}th, professor vid institutionen f{\"{o}}r neurovetenskap vid Uppsala universitet, som sj{\"{a}}lv forskar om p{\r{a}} vilket s{\"{a}}tt hj{\"{a}}rnan styr v{\r{a}}rt f{\"{o}}dointag.

Etanol verkar allts{\r{a}} vara lite som en v{\"{a}}ldigt anpassningsbar pusselbit som passar in i den h{\"{a}}r delen av hungersystemet, och allts{\r{a}} g{\"{o}}r att vi kan bli matsugna p{\r{a}} sm{\r{a}}timmarna.

Forskarna gav m{\"{o}}ss en ”festhelg”
Forskarna injicerade m{\"{o}}ss med alkohol vid olika tillf{\"{a}}llen under en helg. Resultaten var tydliga: de m{\"{o}}ss som fick alkohol fick en {\"{o}}kad aptit.

Det som h{\"{a}}nder {\"{a}}r att de s{\r{a}} kallade Agrp-neuronen aktiveras, i den delen av hj{\"{a}}rnan som kallas hypotalamus, och dessa neuron {\"{a}}r v{\"{a}}ldigt viktiga f{\"{o}}r v{\r{a}}r motivation att {\"{a}}ta. Ju mer alkohol, desto mer aktivitet i dessa neuron, vilket gav en {\"{o}}kad motivation att {\"{a}}ta.

Begreppet ”{\"{o}}lmage” f{\r{a}}r en ny dimension
Det finns m{\r{a}}nga anledningar till att man g{\r{a}}r fr{\r{a}}n tanke till handling n{\"{a}}r det handlar om att {\"{a}}ta, och m{\r{a}}nga system {\"{a}}r involverade, som till exempel ens impulskontrollsf{\"{o}}rm{\r{a}}gor.

Dessa kan ocks{\r{a}} spela in n{\"{a}}r vi {\"{a}}r berusade och blir sugna p{\r{a}} mat, men det verkar som att det nu ocks{\r{a}} finns en ganska enkel f{\"{o}}rklaring: alkoholen har en inbyggd f{\"{o}}rm{\r{a}}ga att {\"{o}}ka v{\r{a}}r motivation till att {\"{a}}ta.

– Med de h{\"{a}}r resultaten visar man att det allts{\r{a}} inte beh{\"{o}}ver vara s{\r{a}} att det bara {\"{a}}r sj{\"{a}}lva {\"{o}}let som ger oss {\"{o}}lmage, s{\"{a}}ger Helgi Schi{\"{o}}th.},

  abstract      = {Bisphenol A (BPA) is used to manufacture polycarbonate plastic and epoxy resins, which are used in baby bottles, as protective coatings on food containers, and for composites and sealants in dentistry. 4-Nonylphenol (NP) is used to make nonylphenol ethoxylates, nonionic surfactants applied as emulsifying, wetting, dispersing, or stabilizing agents in industrial, agricultural, and domestic consumer products. The potential for human exposure to BPA and NP is high because of their widespread use. We measured BPA and NP in archived urine samples from a reference population of 394 adults in the United States using isotope-dilution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The concentration ranges of BPA and NP were similar to those observed in other human populations. BPA was detected in 95\% of the samples examined at concentrations \u2265 0.1 µg/L urine; the geometric mean and median concentrations were 1.33 µg/L (1.36 µg/g creatinine) and 1.28 µg/L (1.32 µg/g creatinine), respectively; the 95th percentile concentration was 5.18 µg/L (7.95 µg/g creatinine). NP was detected in 51\% of the samples examined \u2265 0.1 µg/L. The median and 95th percentile concentrations were < 0.1 µg/L and 1.57 µg/L (1.39 µg/g creatinine), respectively. The frequent detection of BPA suggests widespread exposure to this compound in residents of the United States. The lower frequency of detection of NP than of BPA could be explained by a lower exposure of humans to NP, by different pharmacokinetic factors (i.e., absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination), by the fact that 4-n-nonylphenol--the measured NP isomer--represents a small percentage of the NP used in commercial mixtures, or a combination of all of the above. Additional research is needed to determine the best urinary biomarker(s) to assess exposure to NP. Despite the sample population's nonrepresentativeness of the U.S. population (although sample weights were used to improve the extent to which the results represent the U.S. population) and relatively small size, this study provides the first reference range of human internal dose levels of BPA and NP in a demographically diverse human population.

During WCR, the diet consisted solely of whey protein (n = 8) or sucrose (n = 7) (0.8 g/kg body weight per day). After WCR, DIET, POST1, and POST2, fat mass was reduced by a mean of 2.1, 2.8, 3.8, and 1.9 kg (P < 0.05), with two thirds of this loss from the trunk; and lean mass by 2.8, 1.0, 0.5, and 0.4 kg, respectively. After WCR, serum glucose, insulin, homeostatic model assessment, total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides were reduced, and free fatty acid and cortisol increased. Serum leptin was reduced by 64%, 50%, and 33% following WCR, DIET, and POST1, respectively (P < 0.05). The effects were similar in both groups. In conclusion, a clinically relevant reduction in fat mass can be achieved in overweight men in just 4 days by combining prolonged exercise with CR.},

Items were presented to children from three different perspectives (imagine you are the victim, the bully or a witness). We used peer reports to assess children's role in bullying. Children were grouped into bullies, followers of the bully, defenders of the victims, outsiders, victims and those not involved. The strategy most frequently chosen by all children was to cope with bullying through assertiveness. Bullies considered retaliation effective more often than their classmates, especially when they adopted the perspective of the victim or witness. Bullies did not consider assertive strategies as efficient in stopping the bully. Defenders, outsiders, victims and children not involved, on the other hand, were very much in favour of strategies aimed at solving the conflict through nonchalance or assertiveness, especially when they imagined being the bully. Girls chose assertive strategies more often than boys and younger children preferred nonchalance more often than older children, who tended to choose retaliation more often. Suggestions for intervention are made.},

During the same period, an increase in Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome was reported, suggesting a possible association between Zika virus and Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome. We aimed to assess the role of Zika virus and dengue virus infection in developing Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome.},

  abstract      = {The amount of time asleep varies greatly in mammals, from 3 h in the donkey to 20 h in the armadillo. Previous comparative studies have suggested several functional explanations for interspecific variation in both the total time spent asleep and in rapid-eye movement (REM) or âquietâ (non-REM) sleep. In support of specific functional benefits of sleep, these studies reported correlations between time in specific sleep states (NREM or REM) and brain size, metabolic rate, and developmental variables. Here we show that estimates of sleep duration are significantly influenced by the laboratory conditions under which data are collected and that, when analyses are limited to data collected under more standardized procedures, traditional functional explanations for interspecific variation in sleep durations are no longer supported. Specifically, we find that basal metabolic rate correlates negatively rather than positively with sleep quotas, and that neither adult nor neonatal brain mass correlates positively with REM or NREM sleep times. These results contradict hypotheses that invoke energy conservation, cognition, and development as drivers of sleep variation. Instead, the negative correlations of both sleep states with basal metabolic rate and diet are consistent with trade-offs between sleep and foraging time. In terms of predation risk, both REM and NREM sleep quotas are reduced when animals sleep in more exposed sites, whereas species that sleep socially sleep less. Together with the fact that REM and NREM sleep quotas correlate strongly with each other, these results suggest that variation in sleep primarily reflects ecological constraints acting on total sleep time, rather than the independent responses of each sleep state to specific selection pressures. We propose that, within this ecological framework, interspecific variation in sleep duration might be compensated by variation in the physiological intensity of sleep.},

  abstract      = {AbstractBackground A positive association between fundamental movement skills (FMS) and physical activity (PA) has been shown in previous research of children with and without disability. This pilot study explored a causal mechanism for such relationship, and hypothesized that when \{FMS\} proficiency is improved, enhanced \{PA\} uptake will be found in children with and without disability. It was further hypothesized that improving \{FMS\} proficiency will have a greater impact on children with disability than those without disability. Methods Participants include typically developing (TD) children without disability and children with cerebral palsy (CP), who were allocated to \{FMS\} training groups (CP-FMS nÂ =Â 12, TD-FMS nÂ =Â 13) and control groups (CP-C nÂ =Â 12, TD-C nÂ =Â 13). Training groups practiced five \{FMS\} (run, jump, kick, throw, catch) in weekly 45-min sessions for 4 weeks. Control groups had their regular physiotherapy (CP) or physical education (TD) sessions. \{FMS\} were evaluated using process- and product-oriented measures, and \{PA\} was measured using accelerometers, before and after training. Results It was verified that training groups gained improvements in \{FMS\} while control groups did not. No significant changes in weekday \{PA\} were found. Increased weekend moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was found in the CP-FMS group, while decreased weekend sedentary time was found in the CP-FMS and TD-FMS groups. The percentages of participants who exceeded the minimum detectable change (MDC90) in \{MVPA\} and sedentary time were larger in children with \{CP\} than in children without disability. Conclusion The findings suggest that improved \{FMS\} proficiency could potentially contribute to heightened \{PA\} and decreased sedentary time during weekends for children. Such effect of improved \{FMS\} proficiency on \{PA\} appears to be greater in those with physical disability than in those without disability. It is recommended that the findings of this pilot study should be further examined in future research. },

  abstract      = { The hippocampus is thought to support association-memory, particularly when tested with cued recall. One of the most well-known and studied factors that influences accuracy of verbal association-memory is imageability; participants remember pairs of high-imageability words better than pairs of low-imageability words. High-imageability words are also remembered better in tests of item-memory. However, we previously found that item-memory effects could not explain the enhancement in cued recall, suggesting that imageability enhances association-memory strength. Here we report an fMRI study designed to ask, what is the role of the hippocampus in the memory advantage for associations due to imageability? We tested two alternative hypotheses: (1) Recruitment Hypothesis: High-imageability pairs are remembered better because they recruit the underlying hippocampal association-memory function more effectively. Alternatively, (2) Bypassing Hypothesis: Imageability functions by making the association-forming process easier, enhancing memory in a way that bypasses the hippocampus, as has been found, for example, with explicit unitization imagery strategies. Results found, first, hippocampal BOLD signal was greater during study and recall of high- than low-imageability word pairs. Second, the difference in activity between recalled and forgotten pairs showed a main effect, but no significant interaction with imageability, challenging the bypassing hypothesis, but consistent with the predictions derived from the recruitment hypothesis. Our findings suggest that certain stimulus properties, like imageability, may leverage, rather than avoid, the associative function of the hippocampus to support superior association-memory. },

  abstract      = {Mammalian carnivores fall into two broad dietary groups: smaller carnivores (<20 kg) that feed on very small prey (invertebrates and small vertebrates) and larger carnivores (>20 kg) that specialize in feeding on large vertebrates. We develop a model that predicts the mass-related energy budgets and limits of carnivore size within these groups. We show that the transition from small to large prey can be predicted by the maximization of net energy gain; larger carnivores achieve a higher net gain rate by concentrating on large prey. However, because it requires more energy to pursue and subdue large prey, this leads to a 2-fold step increase in energy expenditure, as well as increased intake. Across all species, energy expenditure and intake both follow a three-fourths scaling with body mass. However, when each dietary group is considered individually they both display a shallower scaling. This suggests that carnivores at the upper limits of each group are constrained by intake and adopt energy conserving strategies to counter this. Given predictions of expenditure and estimates of intake, we predict a maximum carnivore mass of approximately a ton, consistent with the largest extinct species. Our approach provides a framework for understanding carnivore energetics, size, and extinction dynamics.},

colonised different climate zones of the world, including high latitudes and cold environments. The extent to which human
habitation in (sub-)Arctic regions has been enabled by cultural buffering, short-term acclimatization and genetic
adaptations is not clearly understood. Present day indigenous populations of Siberia show a number of phenotypic features,
such as increased basal metabolic rate, low serum lipid levels and increased blood pressure that have been attributed to
adaptation to the extreme cold climate. In this study we introduce a dataset of 200 individuals from ten indigenous Siberian
populations that were genotyped for 730,525 SNPs across the genome to identify genes and non-coding regions that have
undergone unusually rapid allele frequency and long-range haplotype homozygosity change in the recent past. At least
three distinct population clusters could be identified among the Siberians, each of which showed a number of unique
signals of selection. A region on chromosome 11 (chr11:66–69 Mb) contained the largest amount of clustering of significant
signals and also the strongest signals in all the different selection tests performed. We present a list of candidate cold
adaption genes that showed significant signals of positive selection with our strongest signals associated with genes
involved in energy regulation and metabolism (CPT1A, LRP5, THADA) and vascular smooth muscle contraction (PRKG1). By
employing a new method that paints phased chromosome chunks by their ancestry we distinguish local Siberian-specific
long-range haplotype signals from those introduced by admixture},

DESIGN--Review of publications on semen quality in men without a history of infertility selected by means of Cumulated Index Medicus and Current List (1930-1965) and MEDLINE Silver Platter database (1966-August 1991). SUBJECTS--14,947 men included in a total of 61 papers published between 1938 and 1991. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Mean sperm density and mean seminal volume. RESULTS--Linear regression of data weighted by number of men in each study showed a significant decrease in mean sperm count from 113 x 10(6)/ml in 1940 to 66 x 10(6)/ml in 1990 (p < 0.0001) and in seminal volume from 3.40 ml to 2.75 ml (p = 0.027), indicating an even more pronounced decrease in sperm production than expressed by the decline in sperm density. CONCLUSIONS--There has been a genuine decline in semen quality over the past 50 years. As male fertility is to some extent correlated with sperm count the results may reflect an overall reduction in male fertility. The biological significance of these changes is emphasised by a concomitant increase in the incidence of genitourinary abnormalities such as testicular cancer and possibly also cryptorchidism and hypospadias, suggesting a growing impact of factors with serious effects on male gonadal function.},

Background
Smoking and nicotine exposure increase insulin resistance and the risk of type 2 diabetes. Swedish smokeless tobacco (snus) is high in nicotine, and its use is prevalent in Scandinavian countries, but few studies have investigated snus use in relation to diabetes risk.

Objective
To explore the association between snus use and risk of type 2 diabetes using pooled data from five cohorts.

Methods
Analyses were based on prospective studies conducted between 1990 and 2013 including 54 531 never-smoking men and 2441 incident cases of type 2 diabetes identified through screening, self-reporting and hospital and prescription registries. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were assessed and adjusted for age, body mass index, educational level, alcohol consumption and physical activity.

Results
Compared to never users, the HR of type 2 diabetes was 1.15 (95% CI: 1.00â1.32) in current users of snus. In individuals consuming 5â6 boxes per week, the HR was 1.42 (95% CI: 1.07â1.87); in those consuming â¥7 boxes per week, the HR was 1.68 (95% CI: 1.17â2.41). Each additional box of snus consumed per week yielded an HR of 1.08 (95% CI: 1.01â1.16).

Conclusion
Our findings indicate that high consumption of snus is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. The risk was similar to that in smokers, implying that smokers will not reduce their risk of type 2 diabetes by changing to snus use. The results also support the notion that nicotine increases the risk of type 2 diabetes.

  abstract      = {<p>For marine mammals, the ability to tolerate apnea and make extended dives is a defining adaptive trait, facilitating the exploitation of marine food resources. Elevated levels of myoglobin within the muscles are a consistent hallmark of this trait, allowing oxygen collected at the surface to be stored in the muscles and subsequently used to support extended dives. In mysticetes, the largest of marine predators, details on muscular myoglobin levels are limited. The developmental trajectory of muscular myoglobin stores has yet to be documented and any physiological links between early behavior and the development of muscular myoglobin stores remain unknown. In this study, we used muscle tissue samples from stranded mysticetes to investigate these issues. Samples from three different age cohorts and three species of mysticetes were included (total sample size = 18). Results indicate that in mysticete calves, muscle myoglobin stores comprise only a small percentage (17–23%) of conspecific adult myoglobin complements. Development of elevated myoglobin levels is protracted over the course of extended maturation in mysticetes. Additionally, comparisons of myoglobin levels between and within muscles, along with details of interspecific differences in rates of accumulation of myoglobin in very young mysticetes, suggest that levels of exercise may influence the rate of development of myoglobin stores in young mysticetes. This new information infers a close interplay between the physiology, ontogeny and early life history of young mysticetes and provides new insight into the pressures that may shape adaptive strategies in migratory mysticetes. Furthermore, the study highlights the vulnerability of specific age cohorts to impending changes in the availability of foraging habitat and marine resources.</p>},

No detectable 1,2-propanediol or 2,3-butanediol was found in the serum of animals after acetone or saline injection without prior addition of acetone to drinking water or in the serum of animals injected with saline after having been maintained on drinking water containing 1% acetone. These data suggest that acetone both acts to induce a critical enzyme or enzymes and serves as a precursor for the production of 1,2-propanediol. It is also clear from these data that chronic acetone feeding plays a role in 2,3-butanediol production in the rat. Microsomes isolated from the liver of animals maintained on drinking water supplemented with 1% acetone contained two previously unreported enzymatic activities, acetone monooxygenase which converts acetone to acetol and acetol monooxygenase which converts acetol to methylglyoxal. Both activities require O2 and NADPH. Prior treatment with acetone increased serum D-lactate from 9 nmol/ml +/- 9 nmol/ml in control animals to 77 +/- 36 nmol/ml in acetone-fed animals after injection with 5 mumol of acetone/g, body weight. This is consistent with methylglyoxal being a by-product of acetone metabolism. Two pathways for the conversion of acetone to glucose are proposed, the methylglyoxal and the propanediol pathways. The methylglyoxal pathway is responsible for the conversion of acetone to acetol, acetol to methylglyoxal, and the subsequent conversion of methylglyoxal to glucose. The propanediol pathway involves the conversion of acetol to L-1,2-propanediol by an as yet unknown process. L-1,2-Propanediol is converted to L-lactaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase, and L-lactaldehyde is converted to L-lactic acid by aldehyde dehydrogenase. Expression of these metabolic pathways in rat appears to be dependent on the induction of acetone monooxygenase and acetol monooxygenase by acetone.},

  abstract      = {Study Objective: This study sought to investigate the role of nocturnal sleep duration for the retrieval of oversleep consolidated memories, both
prior to and after being cognitively stressed for ~30 minutes the next morning.
Design: Participants learned object locations (declarative memory task comprising 15 card pairs) and a finger tapping sequence (procedural
memory task comprising 5 digits) in the evening. After learning, participants either had a sleep opportunity of 8 hours (between ~23:00 and
~07:00, full sleep condition) or they could sleep between ~03:00 and ~07:00 (short sleep condition). Retrieval of both memory tasks was tested in
the morning after each sleep condition, both before (~08:30) and after being stressed (~09:50).
Setting: Sleep laboratory.
Participants: 15 healthy young men.
Results: The analyses demonstrated that oversleep memory changes did not differ between sleep conditions. However, in their short sleep
condition, following stress hallmarked by increased subjective stress feelings, the men were unable to maintain their pre-stress performance
on the declarative memory task, whereas their performance on the procedural memory task remained unchanged. While men felt comparably
subjectively stressed by the stress intervention, overall no differences between pre- and post-stress recalls were observed following a full night
of sleep.
Conclusions: The findings suggest that 8-h sleep duration, within the range recommended by the US National Sleep Foundation, may not only
help consolidate newly learned procedural and declarative memories, but also ensure full access to both during periods of subjective stress.
Keywords: sleep duration, oversleep memory consolidation, cognitive stress

We sought to replicate published associations between g and 12 specific genetic variants (in the genes DTNBP1, CTSD, DRD2, ANKK1, CHRM2, SSADH, COMT, BDNF, CHRNA4, DISC1, APOE, and SNAP25) using data sets from three independent, well-characterized longitudinal studies with samples of 5,571, 1,759, and 2,441 individuals. Of 32 independent tests across all three data sets, only 1 was nominally significant. By contrast, power analyses showed that we should have expected 10 to 15 significant associations, given reasonable assumptions for genotype effect sizes. For positive controls, we confirmed accepted genetic associations for Alzheimerâs disease and body mass index, and we used SNP-based calculations of genetic relatedness to replicate previous estimates that about half of the variance in g is accounted for by common genetic variation among individuals. We conclude that the molecular genetics of psychology and social science requires approaches that go beyond the examination of candidate genes.},

This is in part because flows of ecosystem services remain poorly characterized at local-to-regional scales, and their protection has not generally been made a priority. We used a spatially explicit conservation planning framework to explore the trade-offs and opportunities for aligning conservation goals for biodiversity with six ecosystem services (carbon storage, flood control, forage production, outdoor recreation, crop pollination, and water provision) in the Central Coast ecoregion of California, United States. We found weak positive and some weak negative associations between the priority areas for biodiversity conservation and the flows of the six ecosystem services across the ecoregion. Excluding the two agriculture-focused services?crop pollination and forage production?eliminates all negative correlations. We compared the degree to which four contrasting conservation network designs protect biodiversity and the flow of the six services. We found that biodiversity conservation protects substantial collateral flows of services. Targeting ecosystem services directly can meet the multiple ecosystem services and biodiversity goals more efficiently but cannot substitute for targeted biodiversity protection (biodiversity losses of 44% relative to targeting biodiversity alone). Strategically targeting only biodiversity plus the four positively associated services offers much promise (relative biodiversity losses of 7%). Here we present an initial analytical framework for integrating biodiversity and ecosystem services in conservation planning and illustrate its application. We found that although there are important potential trade-offs between conservation for biodiversity and for ecosystem services, a systematic planning framework offers scope for identifying valuable synergies.},

COX-3 and one of the PCOX-1 proteins (PCOX-1a) are made from the COX-1 gene but retain intron 1 in their mRNAs. PCOX-1 proteins additionally contain an in-frame deletion of exons 5-8 of the COX-1 mRNA. COX-3 and PCOX mRNAs are expressed in canine cerebral cortex and in lesser amounts in other tissues analyzed. In human, COX-3 mRNA is expressed as an [approx]5.2-kb transcript and is most abundant in cerebral cortex and heart. Intron 1 is conserved in length and in sequence in mammalian COX-1 genes. This intron contains an ORF that introduces an insertion of 30-34 aa, depending on the mammalian species, into the hydrophobic signal peptide that directs COX-1 into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope. COX-3 and PCOX-1a are expressed efficiently in insect cells as membrane-bound proteins. The signal peptide is not cleaved from either protein and both proteins are glycosylated. COX-3, but not PCOX-1a, possesses glycosylation-dependent cyclooxygenase activity. Comparison of canine COX-3 activity with murine COX-1 and -2 demonstrates that this enzyme is selectively inhibited by analgesic/antipyretic drugs such as acetaminophen, phenacetin, antipyrine, and dipyrone, and is potently inhibited by some nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Thus, inhibition of COX-3 could represent a primary central mechanism by which these drugs decrease pain and possibly fever. },

To study the recovery of native plant communities, rabbits were eradicated by poisoning on two islands. This produced a significant increase in species richness on both islands with a decline in the cover of some native species (primarily A. magellanica) and an increase in the abundance of alien species (especially Taraxacum officinale). Other native species showed signs of increased abundance but overall responses were slow. These trends are obviously due to the removal of grazing, but recent changes in climatic conditions (warming and drought) may also be responsible for the decline or slow recovery of native species, and for the success of introduced species. Owing to the effects of present climate changes on plant communities, eradication of alien herbivores may not be always appropriate for the conservation of native biota in the subantarctic islands, and regulation of populations should be explored.},

spatial variability of skin temperature (Tsk) measured at
various points on the hand during convective and cold
contact exposure. A group of 8 subjects participated in
a study of convective cooling of the hand (60 min) and
20 subjects to contact cooling of the finger pad (5 min).
Experiments were carried out in a small climatic chamber
into which the hand was inserted. For convective
cold exposure, Tsk was measured at seven points on the
palmar surface of the fingers of the left hand, one on the
palmar surface and one on the dorsal surface of the
hand. The air temperature inside the mini-chamber was
0, 4, 10 and 16 °C. With the contact cold exposure, the
subjects touched at constant pressures an aluminium
cube cooled to temperatures of -7, 0 and 7 °C in the
same mini-chamber. Contact Tsk was measured on the
finger pad of the index finger of the left hand. The Tsk of
the proximal phalanx of the index finger (on both palm
and back sides), and of the middle phalanx of the little
finger was also measured. The variation of T~k between
the proximal and the distal phalanx of the index finger
was between 1.5 to 10 °C during the convective cold
exposure to an air temperature of 0 °C. Considerable
gradients persisted between the hand and fingers (from
2 to 17°C at 0°C air temperature) and between the
phalanges of the finger (from 0.5 to 11.4 °C at 0 °C air
temperature). The onset of cold induced vasodilatation

(CIVD) on different fingers varied from about 5 to
15 min and it did not always appear in every finger. For
contact cold exposure, when T~k on the contact skin
cooled down to nearly 0 °C, the temperature at the area
close to the contact skin could still be 30 °C. Some cases
of CIVD were observed in the contact skin area, but
not on other measuring points of the same finger. These
results indicated that local thermal stimuli were the
main determinents of CIVD. Representative hand skin
temperature may require five or more measuring
points. Our results strongly emphasised a need to consider
the large spatial and individual variations in the
prediction and modelling of extremity cooling.

Humans residing or working in cold environments exhibit a
stronger cold-induced vasodilation (CIVD) reaction in the
peripheral microvasculature than those living in warm regions of
the world, leading to a general assumption that thermal responses
to local cold exposure can be systematically improved by natural
acclimatization or specific acclimation. However, it remains
unclear whether this improved tolerance is actually due to
systematic acclimatization, or alternately due to the genetic pre-
disposition or self-selection for such occupations. Longitudinal
studies of repeated extremity exposure to cold demonstrate only
ambiguous adaptive responses. In field studies, general cold
acclimation may lead to increased sympathetic activity that results
in reduced finger blood flow. Laboratory studies offer more
control over confounding parameters, but in most studies, no
consistent changes in peripheral blood flow occur even after
repeated exposure for several weeks. Most studies are performed
on a limited amount of subjects only, and the variability of the
CIVD response demands more subjects to obtain significant
results. This review systematically surveys the trainability of CIVD,
concluding that repeated local cold exposure does not alter
circulatory dynamics in the peripheries, and that humans remain
at risk of cold injuries even after extended stays in cold
environments.

Most existing research has focused on hand and finger responses, yet most cold injuries occur in the feet. We investigated if CIVD responses of one finger can predict the responses of other fingers, and also whether the fingers could predict CIVD responses of the feet and toes. Ten subjects immersed their left hand up to the wrist in 8 degrees C water for 30 min. They passively rewarmed for 15 min, followed by immersion of the left foot to the ankle in 8 degrees C water for 30 min. Digit temperature at the edge of the nail bed was recorded on all fingers and toes and on the hand and feet. In all subjects, toe and foot temperature gradually decreased exponentially from approximately 31 to approximately 9 degrees C. No subject exhibited CIVD in any toe or on the foot itself. Eight subjects exhibited CIVD (>1 degrees C temperature increase) in at least one digit of the hand, but no consistent pattern existed in finger response to cold. No subject had strong (>2.0 degrees C) CIVD in all fingers. Five had strong CIVD in some but not all digits, with magnitudes ranging 1.4-7.5 degrees C, while three had weak (<2 degrees C) CIVD in some but not all digits. Four exhibited asynchronous CIVD in the fingers, with cycles beginning at different times. We conclude that CIVD is highly variable across the fingers, and is not a generalizable response across digits or limbs.},

Here we focus on pseudo-profound bullshit, which consists of seemingly impressive assertions that are presented as true and meaningful but are actually vacuous. We presented participants with bullshit statements consisting of buzzwords randomly organized into statements with syntactic structure but no discernible meaning (e.g., “Wholeness quiets infinite phenomena”). Across multiple studies, the propensity to judge bull- shit statements as profound was associated with a variety of conceptually relevant variables (e.g., intuitive cognitive style, supernatural belief). Parallel associations were less evident among profundity judgments for more conventionally profound (e.g., “A wet person does not fear the rain”) or mundane (e.g., “Newborn babies require constant attention”) statements. These results support the idea that some people are more receptive to this type of bullshit and that detecting it is not merely a matter of indiscriminate skepticism but rather a discernment of deceptive vagueness in otherwise impressive sounding claims. Our re- sults also suggest that a bias toward accepting statements as true may be an important component of pseudo-profound bullshit receptivity.

phases of mindfulness training, which are more concerned with the development of focused attention, could be
associated with significant improvements in selective and executive attention whereas the following phases,
which are characterized by an open monitoring of internal and external stimuli, could be mainly associated with
improved unfocused sustained attention abilities. Additionally, MMPs could enhance working memory capacity
and some executive functions. However, many of the included studies show methodological limitations and
negative results have been reported as well, plausibly reflecting differences in study design, study duration and
patients' populations. Accordingly, even thoughfindings here reviewed provided preliminary evidence suggesting
that MMPs could enhance cognitive functions, available evidence should be considered with caution and further

Numerous VDR co-regulatory proteins have been identified, and genome-wide studies have shown that the actions of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) involve regulation of gene activity at a range of locations many kilobases from the transcription start site. The structure of the liganded VDR/RXR complex was recently characterized using cryoelectron microscopy, X-ray scattering, and hydrogen deuterium exchange. These recent technological advances will result in a more complete understanding of VDR coactivator interactions, thus facilitating cell and gene specific clinical applications. Although the identification of mechanisms mediating VDR-regulated transcription has been one focus of recent research in the field, other topics of fundamental importance include the identification and functional significance of proteins involved in the metabolism of vitamin D. CYP2R1 has been identified as the most important 25-hydroxylase, and a critical role for CYP24A1 in humans was noted in studies showing that inactivating mutations in CYP24A1 are a probable cause of idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia. In addition, studies using knockout and transgenic mice have provided new insight on the physiological role of vitamin D in classical target tissues as well as evidence of extraskeletal effects of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) including inhibition of cancer progression, effects on the cardiovascular system, and immunomodulatory effects in certain autoimmune diseases. Some of the mechanistic findings in mouse models have also been observed in humans. The identification of similar pathways in humans could lead to the development of new therapies to prevent and treat disease.},

  abstract      = {Abstract The Franklin Expedition (1845â1848) left in search of the Northwest Passage and ended tragically with the loss of all crew members. Mystery surrounds their ultimate fate, with particular speculation around the role of lead poisoning. Our unique study turns nails from crew member John Hartnell into a time machine to determine what happened to the Franklin Expedition crew members. Using micro-X-ray fluorescence mapping, stable isotopic measurements, and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, we navigate through the nails and temporally characterize lead, copper and zinc content in our subject during the early expedition. By circumventing external contamination on exposed nail surfaces, we challenge the theory that crew members were exposed to high levels of lead on the expedition. Our analyses suggest that lead exposure actually decreased over the course of the expedition and Hartnell's levels were within a healthy, normal range. Our study also finds, however, that Hartnell was severely zinc-deficient, possibly leading to immuno-suppression and ultimately, tuberculosis and death. The significant weight loss from his illness resulted in a flush of previously stored lead from his bones into his blood (and nail), but only in the last few weeks of life. These findings provide new insight on the fate of the other crew members, including the role that diet and zinc deficiency played in the lives of stranded crew members before their demise. },

Throughout this article, she tries to stress that she shares the aims of many of the people whose methods she disagrees with. She does however say that she is concerned about the current education system because she thinks that the methods currently being used to achieve educational improvement simply do not work. She believes that the main reason they do not work is because of a misguided, outdated, and pseudoscientific stigma against the teaching of knowledge. She shares a strong conviction that there is strong empirical evidence about the success of curricula that teach knowledge, and that there is strong evidence about the success of pedagogy that promotes the effective transmission of knowledge. She argues the points that knowledge is at the heart of cognition, and if educators fail to teach knowledge, pupils fail to learn.},

This suggests that searching for a core function of sleep, particularly at the cellular level, is still a worthwhile exercise.



Everybody knows that sleep is important, yet the function of sleep seems like the mythological phoenix: “Che vi sia ciascun lo dice, dove sia nessun lo sa” (“that there is one they all say, where it may be no one knows,” Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Lorenzo da Ponte [1790], Così fan tutte). But what if the search for an essential function of sleep is misguided? What if sleep is not required but rather a kind of extreme indolence that animals indulge in when they have no more pressing needs, such as eating or reproducing? In many circumstances sleeping may be a less dangerous choice than roaming around, wasting energy and exposing oneself to predators. Also, if sleep is just one out of a repertoire of available behaviors that is useful without being essential, it is easier to explain why sleep duration varies so much across species [1–4]. This “null hypothesis” [5–7] would explain why nobody has yet identified a core function of sleep. But how strong is the evidence supporting it? And are there counterexamples?},

  abstract      = {BACKGROUND: Human disturbance can influence wildlife behaviour, which can have implications for wildlife populations. For example, wildlife may be more vigilant near human disturbance, resulting in decreased forage intake and reduced reproductive success. We measured the effects of human activities compared to predator and other environmental factors on the behaviour of elk (Cervus elaphus Linnaeus 1758) in a human-dominated landscape in Alberta, Canada. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We collected year-round behavioural data of elk across a range of human disturbances. We estimated linear mixed models of elk behaviour and found that human factors (land-use type, traffic and distance from roads) and elk herd size accounted for more than 80% of variability in elk vigilance. Elk decreased their feeding time when closer to roads, and road traffic volumes of at least 1 vehicle every 2 hours induced elk to switch into a more vigilant behavioural mode with a subsequent loss in feeding time. Other environmental factors, thought crucial in shaping vigilance behaviour in elk (natural predators, reproductive status of females), were not important. The highest levels of vigilance were recorded on public lands where hunting and motorized recreational activities were cumulative compared to the national park during summer, which had the lowest levels of vigilance. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In a human-dominated landscape, effects of human disturbance on elk behaviour exceed those of habitat and natural predators. Humans trigger increased vigilance and decreased foraging in elk. However, it is not just the number of people but also the type of human activity that influences elk behaviour (e.g. hiking vs. hunting). Quantifying the actual fitness costs of human disturbance remains a challenge in field studies but should be a primary focus for future researches. Some species are much more likely to be disturbed by humans than by non-human predators: for these species, quantifying human disturbance may be the highest priority for conservation.},

We first describe the underlying premises of the theory and then show how the basic DCT mechanisms can be used to model diverse educational phenomena. The research demonstrates that concreteness, imagery, and verbal associative processes play major roles in various educational domains: the representation and comprehension of knowledge, learning and memory of school material, effective instruction, individual differences, achievement motivation and test anxiety, and the learning of motor skills. DCT also has important implications for the science and practice of educational psychology --- specifically, for educational research and teacher education. We show not only that DCT provides a unified explanation for diverse topics in education, but also that its mechanistic framework accommodates theories cast in terms of strategies and other high-level psychological processes. Although much additional research needs to be done, the concrete models that DCT offers for the behavior and experience of students, teachers, and educational psychologists further our understanding of educational phenomena and strengthen related pedagogical practices.},

Sixteen adult male rhesus monkeys received intravas injections of Vasalgel, consisting of 25% styrene maleic acid in dimethyl sulfoxide. After a one-week recovery, males were returned to outdoor group housing, which included at least 3 and up to 9 intact, breeding females with a successful reproductive history.

Results
Treated males have had no conceptions since Vasalgel injections. All males were housed with intact females for at least one breeding season and seven have been almost continually housed with females for 2 years. Complications were minor and included one incident of incorrect placement of Vasalgel into the vas deferens and the development of a sperm granuloma in one animal. Three unilateral vasectomies were performed, one was necessary for incorrect placement of Vasalgel, the other two were elective.

Conclusions
Intravas injection of Vasalgel in sexually mature adult male rhesus monkeys was effective in preventing conception in a free-living, group environment. Complications were few and similar to those associated with traditional vasectomy.

  abstract      = {Episodes of Palaeolithic cannibalism have frequently been defined as ‘nutritional’ in nature, but with little empirical evidence to assess their dietary significance. This paper presents a nutritional template that offers a proxy calorie value for the human body. When applied to the Palaeolithic record, the template provides a framework for assessing the dietary value of prehistoric cannibalistic episodes compared to the faunal record. Results show that humans have a comparable nutritional value to those faunal species that match our typical body weight, but significantly lower than a range of fauna often found in association with anthropogenically modified hominin remains. This could suggest that the motivations behind hominin anthropophagy may not have been purely nutritionally motivated. It is proposed here that the comparatively low nutritional value of hominin cannibalism episodes support more socially or culturally driven narratives in the interpretation of Palaeolithic cannibalism.},

Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the benefits of sex in a novel environment, including stochastic effects in small populations, clonal interference and epistasis between beneficial alleles. These results indicate that clonal interference is important in this system.},

  abstract      = {Many diet and exercise trends have origins in legitimate science, though the facts tend to get distorted by the time they achieve mainstream popularity. Benefits are exaggerated. Risks are downplayed. Science takes a back seat to marketing.

One needn’t look any further than the emerging trend of intermittent fasting for a prime example. Advocates for taking periodic breaks from eating — for up to 24 hours once or twice a week — tout it as an effective and research-backed means of losing weight and improving health. That message has been reaching more and more ears of late.

“Right now, we are at a really important juncture for fasting,” says Brad Pilon, an expert on intermittent fasting and author of the book Eat Stop Eat. “It’s becoming extremely popular.”

So popular, in fact, that it is quickly moving into fad territory, suggests Pilon. And when something becomes a fad — intensely popular but only for a short period — several problems typically ensue. For one, he says, many doctors and nutrition experts are prone to dismissing fads out of hand. So their patients and clients, while shielded from the ridiculous claims of overzealous dieting evangelists, may also lose out on the legitimate benefits of fasting done right. You know, the baby and bathwater thing.

Another concern is that promoters of intermittent fasting will, perhaps unintentionally, encourage extreme behaviour, such as bingeing. This is reflected in the photos accompanying many recent new articles on “the fast diet” or the “5:2 diet.” Often, they depict people eating heaps of high-calorie, high-fat foods, such as hamburgers, french fries and cake. The implication being that if you fast two days a week, you can devour as much junk as your gullet can swallow during the remaining five days.

There is a large body of evidence that suggests fasting can benefit both the body and brain, but most research has been conducted on animals, such as mice. Researchers studying fasting are calling for more human studies.

Not so, say more moderate proponents of fasting. Their take on intermittent fasting: eat sensibly most of the time, eat nothing for an extended period every now and then, indulge only on occasion (perhaps once a week, say, on a designated “cheat day”). There is research, they claim, to back up the health benefits of sensibly incorporating fasting into your lifestyle.

There is indeed a large body of research to support the health benefits of fasting, though most of it has been conducted on animals, not humans. Still, the results have been promising. Fasting has been shown to improve biomarkers of disease, reduce oxidative stress and preserve learning and memory functioning, according to Mark Mattson, senior investigator for the National Institute on Aging, part of the US National Institutes of Health. Mattson has investigated the health benefits of intermittent fasting on the cardiovascular system and brain in rodents, and has called for “well-controlled human studies” in people “across a range of body mass indexes” (J Nutr Biochem 2005;16:129–37).

There are several theories about why fasting provides physiological benefits, says Mattson. “The one that we’ve studied a lot, and designed experiments to test, is the hypothesis that during the fasting period, cells are under a mild stress,” he says. “And they respond to the stress adaptively by enhancing their ability to cope with stress and, maybe, to resist disease.”

Though the word “stress” is often used in a negative sense, taxing the body and mind has benefits. Consider vigorous exercise, which stresses, in particular, muscles and the cardiovascular system. As long as you give your body time to recover, it will grow stronger. “There is considerable similarity between how cells respond to the stress of exercise and how cells respond to intermittent fasting,” says Mattson.

Mattson has contributed to several other studies on intermittent fasting and caloric restriction. In one, overweight adults with moderate asthma consumed only 20% of their normal calorie intake on alternate days (Free Radical Bio Med 2007;42:665–74). Participants who adhered to the diet lost 8% of their initial body weight over eight weeks. They also saw a decrease in markers of oxidative stress and inflammation, and improvement of asthma-related symptoms and several quality-of-life indicators.

In another study, Mattson and colleagues explored the effects of intermittent and continuous energy restriction on weight loss and various biomarkers (for conditions including breast cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular disease) among young overweight woman (Int J Obesity 2011;35:714–27). They found that intermittent restriction was as effective as continuous restriction for improving weight loss, insulin sensitivity and other health biomarkers.

Mattson has also researched the protective benefits of fasting to neurons. If you don’t eat for 10–16 hours, your body will go to its fat stores for energy, and fatty acids called ketones will be released into the bloodstream. This has been shown to protect memory and learning functionality, says Mattson, as well as slow disease processes in the brain.

But perhaps it isn’t so much the fasting that produces health benefits, per se, as the resulting overall reduction in calorie intake (if, that is, you don’t overeat on nonfasting days, which could create a caloric surplus instead of a deficit). That appears, at least, to be the case in slowing diseases such as cancer in mice, according to Dr. Stephen Freedland, associate professor of urology and pathology at the Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina.

“Caloric restriction, undernutrition without malnutrition, is the only experimental approach consistently shown to prolong survival in animal models,” Freedland and colleagues stated in a study on the effects of intermittent fasting on prostate cancer growth in mice (Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis 2010; 13:350–5). In the study, mice fasted twice a week for 24 hours, but were otherwise permitted to eat at liberty. During nonfasting days, the mice overate. Overall, they did not lose weight, counteracting whatever benefits they might have seen from fasting. Intermittent fasting with compensatory overeating “did not improve mouse survival nor did it delay prostrate tumor growth,” the study concluded.

To improve health, the goal should be to lose weight by reducing the total amount of calories consumed, suggests Freedland, rather than focusing on when those calories are consumed. “If you [don’t] eat two days a week, and limit what you eat the other five days, you will lose weight. It’s one approach to losing weight,” he says. “I’m not sure it works any better than cutting down slightly seven days a week.”

People should also be wary of books written for broad audiences that explain the science behind fasting or any other health trend, he says. One purpose of writing a book for the consumer market, after all, is to sell as many copies as possible. Authors tend to present only evidence supporting their point of view, suggests Freedland, while ignoring evidence that contradicts it. “It’s a lot of spin when you write a book.”},

Daily excretion of thiamin and vitamin B6 in micrograms per gram creatinine were in the low-to-deficient ranges established by the ICNND during the calorie restriction period, indicating rapid depletion of body stores. Although riboflavin excretion decreased during the latter days of calorie restriction (studies I and II), these values remained in the high range of acceptability. The elevated excretions of riboflavin are indicative of adequate reserves and catabolism of body protein for use as energy, or both.

These data suggest that under conditions of calorie restriction, the daily minimal allowances of vitamins B1, B2, and B6 are influenced by the calorie, vitamin, and protein intakes, the degree of negative nitrogen balance, and the subsequent protein catabolism.},

When people lack the expertise and skill to evaluate the science behind a claim, they typically rely on heuristics such as substituting judgment about something complex (i.e. climate science) with judgment about something simple (i.e. the character of people who speak about climate science) and are therefore vulnerable to misleading information. Inoculation theory offers one approach to effectively neutralize the influence of misinformation. Typically, inoculations convey resistance by providing people with information that counters misinformation. In contrast, we propose inoculating against misinformation by explaining the fallacious reasoning within misleading denialist claims. We offer a strategy based on critical thinking methods to analyse and detect poor reasoning within denialist claims. This strategy includes detailing argument structure, determining the truth of the premises, and checking for validity, hidden premises, or ambiguous language. Focusing on argument structure also facilitates the identification of reasoning fallacies by locating them in the reasoning process. Because this reason-based form of inoculation is based on general critical thinking methods, it offers the distinct advantage of being accessible to those who lack expertise in climate science. We applied this approach to 42 common denialist claims and find that they all demonstrate fallacious reasoning and fail to refute the scientific consensus regarding anthropogenic global warming. This comprehensive deconstruction and refutation of the most common denialist claims about climate change is designed to act as a resource for communicators and educators who teach climate science and/or critical thinking.},

What is already known about this topic?

In 2015, CDC established that there were approximately 41 million contact lens wearers aged ≥18 years in the United States, the majority of whom engaged in behaviors that put them at risk for serious eye infections.

What is added by this report?

In 2016, there were an estimated 3.6 million adolescents aged 12–17 years in the United States who wore contact lenses. Of the adolescents who wore contact lenses, 85% reported at least one behavior that put them at risk for a contact lens–related eye infection, compared with 81% of young adults, and 88% of older adults.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Although adolescent contact lens wearers engage in some healthier contact lens hygiene behaviors than do their adult counterparts, there is room for improvement in order to prevent potentially serious outcomes including blindness. Prevention efforts should focus on encouraging contact lens wearers to replace their contact lens storage case regularly and to avoid sleeping or napping in contact lenses.},

  abstract      = {DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide) is the active ingredient of most commercial insect repellents. This compound has commonly been detected in aquatic water samples from around the world indicating that DEET is both mobile and persistent, despite earlier assumptions that DEET was unlikely to enter aquatic ecosystems. DEET's registration category does not require an ecological risk assessment, thus information on the ecological toxicity of DEET is sparse. This paper reviews the presence of DEET in aqueous samples from around the world (e.g. drinking water, streams, open seawater, groundwater and treated effluent) with reported DEET concentrations ranging from 40â3000Â ng Lâ1. In addition, new DEET data collected from 36 sites in coastal waterways from eastern Australia (detections ranging from 8 to 1500Â ng Lâ1) are examined. A summary of new and existing toxicity data are discussed with an emphasis on preparing a preliminary risk assessment for DEET in the aquatic environment. Collated information on DEET in the aquatic environment suggests risk to aquatic biota at observed environmental concentrations is minimal. However, the information available was not sufficient to conduct a full risk assessment due to data deficiencies in source characterisation, transport mechanisms, fate, and ecotoxicity studies. These risks warrant further investigation due to the high frequency that this organic contaminant is detected in aquatic environments around the world.},

Here we present a simple mathematical model and various empirical examples to show how the value attributed to rarity in some human activities could precipitate the extinction of rare species?a concept that we term the anthropogenic Allee effect. The alarming finding that human perception of rarity can precipitate species extinction has serious implications for the conservation of species that are rare or that may become so, be they charismatic and emblematic or simply likely to become fashionable for certain activities.},

However, this doesnât mean that they are not threatened, and which species are âcharismaticâ remains unclear. Here, we identify the 10 most charismatic animals and show that they are at high risk of imminent extinction in the wild. We also find that the public ignores these animalsâ predicament and we suggest it could be due to the observed biased perception of their abundance, based more on their profusion in our culture than on their natural populations. We hypothesize that this biased perception impairs conservation efforts because people are unaware that the animals they cherish face imminent extinction and do not perceive their urgent need for conservation. By freely using the image of rare and threatened species in their product marketing, many companies may participate in creating this biased perception, with unintended detrimental effects on conservation efforts, which should be compensated by channeling part of the associated profits to conservation. According to our hypothesis, this biased perception would be likely to last as long as the massive cultural and commercial presence of charismatic species is not accompanied by adequate information campaigns about the imminent threats they face.},

When possible, fluid should be ingested at rates that most closely match sweating rate. When that is not possible or practical or sufficiently ergogenic, some athletes might tolerate body water losses amounting to 2\% of body weight without significant risk to physical well-being or performance when the environment is cold (e.g. 5â10Â°C) or temperate (e.g. 21â22Â°C). However, when exercising in a hot environment (â>30Â°C), dehydration by 2\% of body weight impairs absolute power production and predisposes individuals to heat injury. Fluid should not be ingested at rates in excess of sweating rate and thus body water and weight should not increase during exercise. Fatigue can be reduced by adding carbohydrate to the fluids consumed so that 30â60âg of rapidly absorbed carbohydrate are ingested throughout each hour of an athletic event. Furthermore, sodium should be included in fluids consumed during exercise lasting longer than 2âh or by individuals during any event that stimulates heavy sodium loss (more than 3â4âg of sodium). Athletes do not benefit by ingesting glycerol, amino acids or alleged precursors of neurotransmitter. Ingestion of other substances during exercise, with the possible exception of caffeine, is discouraged. Athletes will benefit the most by tailoring their individual needs for water, carbohydrate and salt to the specific challenges of their sport, especially considering the environment's impact on sweating and heat stress. },

Most studies have been naturalistic correlative investigations, where sleep schedules were correlated with school and academic achievement. Nonetheless, some authors were able to actively manipulate sleep in order to observe neurocognitive and behavioral consequences, such as learning, memory capacity and school performance. The findings strongly suggest that: (a) students of different education levels (from school to university) are chronically sleep deprived or suffer from poor sleep quality and consequent daytime sleepiness; (b) sleep quality and quantity are closely related to student learning capacity and academic performance; (c) sleep loss is frequently associated with poor declarative and procedural learning in students; (d) studies in which sleep was actively restricted or optimized showed, respectively, a worsening and an improvement in neurocognitive and academic performance. These results may been related to the specific involvement of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in vulnerability to sleep loss. Most methodological limitations are discussed and some future research goals are suggested. },

  abstract      = {Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is contraindicated in women with a history of breast cancer or a high risk of breast cancer development. Recent results from large clinical trials, such as the Women’s Health Initiative, have demonstrated increased risks of thromboembolic events and a moderate increased risk of breast cancer in women using conjugated estrogens and progestogens. There is a need for viable nonhormonal alternative treatments to HRT, such as nutritional and botanical therapies, in this population of women, who tend to experience more significant vasomotor symptoms. Safe and effective therapies that do not stimulate breast cell proliferation could prove extremely useful for the management of such symptoms for women in both low- and high-risk breast cancer populations. As a non-hormonal treatment, anti-depressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), have been shown to improve hot flash symptoms in women. The proposed mechanism is related to an increase in serotonin allowing for an increase in the set point of the brain’s thermoregulator. In small clinical studies, the administration of tryptophan and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5HTP), the precursors of serotonin, have been shown to reduce depressive symptoms, possibly by enhancing the synthesis of serotonin. Thus, increased serotonin levels may have the ability to decrease hot flashes in a mechanism similar to that of SSRIs without the risks of breast cell stimulation. This would be particularly desirable for menopausal women with breast cancer or with risks of breast cancer. This article discusses the background information on hot flashes, SSRIs, tryptophan, and 5HTP, and possible clinical application of 5HTP for menopausal women with breast cancer risk.},

  abstract      = {Cold-induced vasodilation (CIVD) in the finger
tips generally occurs 5–10 min after the start of local cold
exposure of the extremities. This phenomenon is believed
to reduce the risk of local cold injuries. However, CIVD
is almost absent during hypothermia, when survival of the
organism takes precedence over the survival of peripheral
tissue. Subjects that are often exposed to local cold (e.g.
fish filleters) develop an enhanced CIVD response. Also,
differences between ethnic groups are obvious, with black
people having the weakest CIVD response. Many other
factors affect CIVD, such as diet, alcohol consumption,
altitude, age and stress. CIVD is probably caused by a
sudden decrease in the release of neurotransmitters from
the sympathetic nerves to the muscular coat of the arterio-venous
anastomoses (AVAs) due to local cold. AVAs
are specific thermoregulatory organs that regulate blood
flow in the cold and heat. Their relatively large diameter
enables large amounts of blood to pass and convey heat
to the surrounding tissue. Unfortunately, information on
the quantity of AVAs is lacking, which makes it difficult
to estimate the full impact on peripheral blood flow. This
review illustrates the thermospecificity of the AVAs and
the close link to CIVD. CIVD is influenced by many
parameters, but controlled experiments yield information
on how CIVD protects the extremities against cold
injuries.

Introduction: Cold-induced vasodilation (CIVD) is mentioned as a mechanism that may prevent the occurrence of local cold injuries. The magnitude of the CIVD reaction differs considerably between subjects and there were some indications that those subjects with a fast CIVD reaction with high amplitude had a reduced risk for cold injuries. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the magnitude of the finger CIVD reaction in subjects prior to operation in cold areas and to relate these scores to the occurrence of cold injuries. Methods: In order to evaluate the magnitude of the CIVD response, 206 subjects immersed their left middle finger in ice water for 30 min. The Resistance Index for Frostbite (RIF) according to Yoshimura was determined on the basis of the finger skin temperature response. This index ranges from 3 (high risk) to 9 (low risk) depending on the response time and response magnitude. Later, most of the screened subjects deployed as part of a group of 1080 marines for winter operations in Norway. Results: The Caucasian subjects in this study had higher RIF scores than the non-Caucasians (7.0 ± 1.6 vs. 6.1 ± 2.1). The mean RIF was relatively high as compared with a reference group of Japanese male soldiers (6.9 ± 1.7 vs. 5.7 ± 1.7). Unexpectedly, smokers had a higher RIF score than non-smokers did. The RIF score was inversely related to pain during the test. There were 54 marines who suffered cold injuries during training in Norway. Of those, 11 were in the measured group of 206 marines. These subjects had a RIF of 5.2 ± 1.6, as compared with 7.0 ± 1.6 for the remaining subjects, which was significantly different. Conclusions: The RIF shows considerable differences between subjects. The RIF, determined in a simple lab test, may be related to the risk for cold injuries during operations in the field.

First, the repeated impact of the shoe on the floor during walking serves to loosen the knot. Then, the whipping motions of the free ends of the laces caused by the leg swing produce slipping of the laces. This leads to eventual runaway untangling of the knot. As demonstrated using slow-motion video footage and a series of experiments, the failure of the knot happens in a matter of seconds, often without warning, and is catastrophic. The controlled experiments showed that increasing inertial effects of the swinging laces leads to increased rate of knot untying, that the directions of the impact and swing influence the rate of failure, and that the knot structure has a profound influence on a knot{\textquoteright}s tendency to untie under cyclic impact loading.},

In the first experiment, samples were incubated in the laboratory at 4, 10, 16, 23 or 30°C, with constant moisture, and the loss of 14C was monitored for 550 days. Double negative exponential functions fitted to the 14C loss data at different temperatures were used to define the relative proportions of labile and recalcitrant components in the original straw. The estimated proportions of these constituents were related to incubation temperatures with the amount of C reflecting the labile fraction increasing with increasing temperature. In the second experiment samples mixed with the labelled straw were incubated at 4, 16 or 30°C until the same percentage of 14C loss was reached. The samples were then incubated again at a common temperature for 30 days and CO[2] production was measured to assess the lability of the remaining material. For all the soils, the amount of readily decomposed material was higher in samples conditioned at 4° than at 30°C. It was concluded that in addition to temperature controlling rates of C mineralisation in soil it also affects the processes of decomposition so that material produced at higher temperatures was more recalcitrant than at lower temperatures.},

This impactor-derived water resides in two distinct reservoirs: in impact melts and projectile survivors. Impact melt hosts the bulk of the delivered water. Entrapment of water within impact glasses and melt-bearing breccias is therefore a plausible source of hydration features associated with craters on the Moon and elsewhere in the solar system and likely contributed to the early accretion of water during planet formation.},

  abstract      = {During the past two decades, mindfulness meditation has gone from being a fringe topic of scientific investigation to being an occasional replacement for psychotherapy, tool of corporate well-being, widely implemented educational practice, and âkey to building more resilient soldiers.â Yet the mindfulness movement and empirical evidence supporting it have not gone without criticism. Misinformation and poor methodology associated with past studies of mindfulness may lead public consumers to be harmed, misled, and disappointed. Addressing such concerns, the present article discusses the difficulties of defining mindfulness, delineates the proper scope of research into mindfulness practices, and explicates crucial methodological issues for interpreting results from investigations of mindfulness. For doing so, the authors draw on their diverse areas of expertise to review the present state of mindfulness research, comprehensively summarizing what we do and do not know, while providing a prescriptive agenda for contemplative science, with a particular focus on assessment, mindfulness training, possible adverse effects, and intersection with brain imaging. Our goals are to inform interested scientists, the news media, and the public, to minimize harm, curb poor research practices, and staunch the flow of misinformation about the benefits, costs, and future prospects of mindfulness meditation.

They receive the prize for their discovery that double-stranded RNA triggers suppression of gene activity in a homology-dependent manner, a process named RNA interference (RNAi). Their discovery revealed a new mechanism for gene regulation, and the biochemical machinery involved plays a key role in many essential cellular processes. Double-stranded RNA synthesized within the cell can reduce or abolish gene activity by RNAi-like mechanisms. This control system for gene expression has proven to be important for both the development of an organism and the physiological functions of cells and tissues. Furthermore, RNAi protects against RNA virus infections, especially in plants and invertebrate animals, and secures genome stability by keeping mobile elements silent. Today, double-stranded RNA is used as a powerful tool to experimentally elucidate the function of essentially any gene in a cell. The discovery of RNAi has already had an immense impact on biomedical research and will most likely lead to novel medical applications in the future.},

Using baseline phenotypes collected for 112,000 individuals by the UK Biobank, we can now elaborate on previous findings that identified associations between signatures of positive selection on Neanderthal DNA and various modern human traits but not any specific phenotypic consequences. Here, we show that Neanderthal DNA affects skin tone and hair color, height, sleeping patterns, mood, and smoking status in present-day Europeans. Interestingly, multiple Neanderthal alleles at different loci contribute to skin and hair color in present-day Europeans, and these Neanderthal alleles contribute to both lighter and darker skin tones and hair color, suggesting that Neanderthals themselves were most likely variable in these traits.

Using baseline phenotypes collected for 112,000 individuals by the UK Biobank, we can now elaborate on previous findings that identified associations between signatures of positive selection on Neanderthal DNA and various modern human traits but not any specific phenotypic consequences. Here, we show that Neanderthal DNA affects skin tone and hair color, height, sleeping patterns, mood, and smoking status in present-day Europeans. Interestingly, multiple Neanderthal alleles at different loci contribute to skin and hair color in present-day Europeans, and these Neanderthal alleles contribute to both lighter and darker skin tones and hair color, suggesting that Neanderthals themselves were most likely variable in these traits.},

  abstract      = {The observable traits of wild populations are continually shaped and reshaped by the environment and numerous agents of natural selection, including predators. In stark contrast with most predators, humans now typically exploit high proportions of prey populations and target large, reproductive-aged adults. Consequently, organisms subject to consistent and strong ‘harvest selection’ by fishers, hunters, and plant harvesters may be expected to show particularly rapid and dramatic changes in phenotype. However, a comparison of the rate at which phenotypic changes in exploited taxa occurs relative to other systems has never been undertaken. Here, we show that average phenotypic changes in 40 human-harvested systems are much more rapid than changes reported in studies examining not only natural (n = 20 systems) but also other human-driven (n = 25 systems) perturbations in the wild, outpacing them by >300% and 50%, respectively. Accordingly, harvested organisms show some of the most abrupt trait changes ever observed in wild populations, providing a new appreciation for how fast phenotypes are capable of changing. These changes, which include average declines of almost 20% in size-related traits and shifts in life history traits of nearly 25%, are most rapid in commercially exploited systems and, thus, have profound conservation and economic implications. Specifically, the widespread potential for transitively rapid and large effects on size- or life history-mediated ecological dynamics might imperil populations, industries, and ecosystems.},

The species that we target are thus far in considerable decline; however, predators in the wild generally achieve a balance with their prey populations such that both persist. Darimont et al. found several specific differences between how humans and other predatory species target prey populations (see the Perspective by Worm). In marine environments, for example, we regularly prey on other predator species. These differences may contribute to our much larger ecological impact when compared with other predators.Science, this issue p. 858; see also p. 784Paradigms of sustainable exploitation focus on population dynamics of prey and yields to humanity but ignore the behavior of humans as predators. We compared patterns of predation by contemporary hunters and fishers with those of other predators that compete over shared prey (terrestrial mammals and marine fishes). Our global survey (2125 estimates of annual finite exploitation rate) revealed that humans kill adult prey, the reproductive capital of populations, at much higher median rates than other predators (up to 14 times higher), with particularly intense exploitation of terrestrial carnivores and fishes. Given this competitive dominance, impacts on predators, and other unique predatory behavior, we suggest that humans function as an unsustainable {\textquotedblleft}super predator,{\textquotedblright} which{\textemdash}unless additionally constrained by managers{\textemdash}will continue to alter ecological and evolutionary processes globally.},

  abstract      = {Background: As a cross-boundary resource subsidy, spawning salmon can strongly affect consumer and ecosystem ecology. Here we examine whether this marine resource can influence a terrestrial wolf-deer (Canis lupus-Odocoileus hemionus) predator-prey system in coastal British Columbia, Canada. Data on resource availability and resource use among eight wolf groups for three seasons over four years allow us to evaluate competing hypotheses that describe salmon as either an alternate resource, consumed in areas where deer are scarce, or as a targeted resource, consumed as a positive function of its availability. Faecal (n = 2203 wolf scats) and isotopic analyses (n = 60 wolf hair samples) provide independent data sets, also allowing us to examine how consistent these common techniques are in estimating foraging behaviour. RESULTS: At the population level during spring and summer, deer remains occurred in roughly 90 and 95% of faeces respectively. When salmon become available in autumn, however, the population showed a pronounced dietary shift in which deer consumption among groups was negatively correlated (r = -0.77, P <0.001) with consumption of salmon, which occurred in 40% of all faeces and up to 70% of faeces for some groups. This dietary shift as detected by faecal analysis was correlated with seasonal shifts in d13C isotopic signatures (r = 0.78; P = 0.008), which were calculated by intra-hair comparisons between segments grown during summer and fall. The magnitude of this seasonal isotopic shift, our proxy for salmon use, was related primarily to estimates of salmon availability, not deer availability, among wolf groups. CONCLUSIONS: Concordance of faecal and isotopic data suggests our intra-hair isotopic methodology provides an accurate proxy for salmon consumption, and might reliably track seasonal dietary shifts in other consumer-resource systems. Use of salmon by wolves as a function of its abundance and the adaptive explanations we provide suggest a long-term and widespread association between wolves and salmon. Seasonally, this system departs from the common wolf-ungulate model. Broad ecological implications include the potential transmission of marine-based disease into terrestrial systems, the effects of marine subsidy on wolf-deer population dynamics, and the distribution of salmon nutrients by wolves into coastal ecosystems.},

Deme-group selection may establish strictly altruistic genes in a population, but only under limited conditions, and perhaps never among vertebrates, among which apparently altruistic behaviors may always potentially benefit the altruists. Responsive-group selection is a more effective mode of evolution of altruism, conspicuous in man. Evolutionary reinforcement increases the force of selection of advantageous behaviors, including altruistic ones, by making them pleasant or rewarding. It is probably involved also in ecological habitat selection, and may be the source of many human emotions, including esthetic ones. Throwing (of stones and weapons) exemplifies both the possible importance of a difficult-to-measure evolutionary factor and the role of reinforcement; in human evolution throwing may have been decisive in foodgetting and fighting, in shifting emphasis from brute force to skill, and in inducing evolution of a brain able to handle three-body geometric problems precisely and thus preadapted for more complex functions.

The use of l-Trp as a dietary supplement was discontinued in 1989 due to an outbreak of eosinophilia–myalgia syndrome (EMS) that was traced to a contaminated synthetic l-Trp from a single manufacturer. 5-HTP has since become a popular dietary supplement in lieu of the removal of l-Trp from the market. Because of its chemical and biochemical relationship to l-Trp, 5-HTP has been under vigilance by consumers, industry, academia and government for its safety. However, no definitive cases of toxicity have emerged despite the worldwide usage of 5-HTP for last 20 years, with the possible exception of one unresolved case of a Canadian woman. Extensive analyses of several sources of 5-HTP have shown no toxic contaminants similar to those associated with l-Trp, nor the presence of any other significant impurities. A minor chromatographic peak (peak X) reported in some 5-HTP samples lacks credibility due to chromatographic artifacts and infinitesimal concentrations, and has raised undue speculations concerning its chemistry and toxicity. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This is true, but the real wonder is the rise of antibiotic resistance in hospitals, communities, and the environment concomitant with their use. The extraordinary genetic capacities of microbes have benefitted from man's overuse of antibiotics to exploit every source of resistance genes and every means of horizontal gene transmission to develop multiple mechanisms of resistance for each and every antibiotic introduced into practice clinically, agriculturally, or otherwise. This review presents the salient aspects of antibiotic resistance development over the past half-century, with the oft-restated conclusion that it is time to act. To achieve complete restitution of therapeutic applications of antibiotics, there is a need for more information on the role of environmental microbiomes in the rise of antibiotic resistance. In particular, creative approaches to the discovery of novel antibiotics and their expedited and controlled introduction to therapy are obligatory.},

  abstract      = {Motivation: In recent years, several methods have been proposed
for determining metabolic pathways in an automated way based
on network topology. The aim of this work is to analyse these
methods by tackling a concrete example relevant in biochemistry.
It concerns the question whether even-chain fatty acids, being the
most important constituents of lipids, can be converted into sugars
at steady state. It was proved five decades ago that this conversion
using the Krebs cycle is impossible unless the enzymes of the
glyoxylate shunt (or alternative bypasses) are present in the system.
Using this example, we can compare the various methods in pathway
analysis.
Results: Elementary modes analysis (EMA) of a set of enzymes
corresponding to the Krebs cycle, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis
supports the scientific evidence showing that there is no pathway
capable of converting acetyl-CoA to glucose at steady state. This
conversion is possible after the addition of isocitrate lyase and malate
synthase (forming the glyoxylate shunt) to the system. Dealing with
the same example, we compare EMA with two tools based on graph
theory available online, PathFinding and Pathway Hunter Tool. These
automated network generating tools do not succeed in predicting
the conversions known from experiment. They sometimes generate
unbalanced paths and reveal problems identifying side metabolites
that are not responsible for the carbon net flux. This shows that, for
metabolic pathway analysis, it is important to consider the topology
(including bimolecular reactions) and stoichiometry of metabolic
systems, as is done in EMA.

Despite the historical significance of the disease, the mechanisms underlying the spread of plague in Europe are poorly understood. While it is commonly assumed that rats and their fleas spread plague during the Second Pandemic, there is little historical and archaeological support for such a claim. Here, we show that human ectoparasites, like body lice and human fleas, might be more likely than rats to have caused the rapidly developing epidemics in pre-Industrial Europe. Such an alternative transmission route explains many of the notable epidemiological differences between historical and modern plague epidemics.Plague, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, can spread through human populations by multiple transmission pathways. Today, most human plague cases are bubonic, caused by spillover of infected fleas from rodent epizootics, or pneumonic, caused by inhalation of infectious droplets. However, little is known about the historical spread of plague in Europe during the Second Pandemic (14{\textendash}19th centuries), including the Black Death, which led to high mortality and recurrent epidemics for hundreds of years. Several studies have suggested that human ectoparasite vectors, such as human fleas (Pulex irritans) or body lice (Pediculus humanus humanus), caused the rapidly spreading epidemics. Here, we describe a compartmental model for plague transmission by a human ectoparasite vector. Using Bayesian inference, we found that this model fits mortality curves from nine outbreaks in Europe better than models for pneumonic or rodent transmission. Our results support that human ectoparasites were primary vectors for plague during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death (1346{\textendash}1353), ultimately challenging the assumption that plague in Europe was predominantly spread by rats.},

  abstract      = {Sleep-induced apnea and disordered breathing refers to intermittent, cyclical cessations or reductions of airflow, with or without obstructions of the upper airway (OSA). In the presence of an anatomically compromised, collapsible airway, the sleep-induced loss of compensatory tonic input to the upper airway dilator muscle motor neurons leads to collapse of the pharyngeal airway. In turn, the ability of the sleeping subject to compensate for this airway obstruction will determine the degree of cycling of these events. Several of the classic neurotransmitters and a growing list of neuromodulators have now been identified that contribute to neurochemical regulation of pharyngeal motor neuron activity and airway patency. Limited progress has been made in developing pharmacotherapies with acceptable specificity for the treatment of sleep-induced airway obstruction. We review three types of major long-term sequelae to severe OSA that have been assessed in humans through use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment and in animal models via long-term intermittent hypoxemia (IH): 1) cardiovascular. The evidence is strongest to support daytime systemic hypertension as a consequence of severe OSA, with less conclusive effects on pulmonary hypertension, stroke, coronary artery disease, and cardiac arrhythmias. The underlying mechanisms mediating hypertension include enhanced chemoreceptor sensitivity causing excessive daytime sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity, combined with overproduction of superoxide ion and inflammatory effects on resistance vessels. 2) Insulin sensitivity and homeostasis of glucose regulation are negatively impacted by both intermittent hypoxemia and sleep disruption, but whether these influences of OSA are sufficient, independent of obesity, to contribute significantly to the âmetabolic syndromeâ remains unsettled. 3) Neurocognitive effects include daytime sleepiness and impaired memory and concentration. These effects reflect hypoxic-induced âneural injury.â We discuss future research into understanding the pathophysiology of sleep apnea as a basis for uncovering newer forms of treatment of both the ventilatory disorder and its multiple sequelae.},

HERV-K is the most biologically active form, since members of this family have intact open reading frames for the gag, pol or envgenes. Antibody response against HERV-K peptides has been reported in leukemia patients, suggesting a possible overexpression of this sequence in leukemic cells. Using real-time quantitative RT-PCR (TaqMan), we found that in six of the eight leukemia samples we collected, transcriptional activity of HERV-K10-like gag gene was 5- to 10-fold higher than in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or mononuclear cells from cord blood. The overexpression was marked enough to be detected by Northern blot. In addition, there was no significant variation of HERV-K expression in normal PBMCs after exposure to different factors (PHA, gamma irradiation, 5-azacytidine) that potentially modulate HERV expression. This suggests that HERV-K relative overexpression in leukemia samples might be specifically associated with tumor development. The origin of these transcriptional variations is therefore worth being investigated further.},

Maternal exposure to estrogenic pesticides, such as 1,1-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-2,2,2-trichloroethane (DDT) and methoxychlor (MTC), has been shown to result in reproductive disorders and/or abnormal fetal development. In this study, we have examined the effects of exposure of trophoblastic cells to MTC and DTT, in comparison to 17-estradiol (E2) and diethylstilbestrol (DES), to test the hypothesis that cellular Ca handling is a target for these endocrine disruptive components. Treatment with DDT, MTC, DES, or E2 increased cellular Ca uptake, and the expression of trophoblast-specific human Ca binding protein (HCaBP) was down-regulated by both MTC and DDT. Treatment with MTC, DDT, and DES inhibited cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and suppressed expression of several trophoblast differentiation marker genes. These effects were reversed by overexpression of metallothionein IIa, a gene highly responsive to cadmium and other metals. These results strongly suggest that trophoblast Ca handling functions are endocrinally modulated, and that their alteration by candidate endocrine disruptors, such as MTC and DDT, constitutes a possible pathway of the harmful effects of these components on fetal development.

ObjectiveTo determine the prevalence of coliform and potentially pathogenic bacteria in remote backcountry alpine lakes and streams of national parks in the Sierra Nevada mountains.

Methods
Water was sampled at 55 predetermined lakes and streams that would stratify the risk, based on sites used by backpackers, sites used by pack animals, and uncontaminated wild areas. Sites were distributed among Kings Canyon (15), Sequoia (17), and Yosemite (23). Water was collected using Millipore bacterial samplers, which provided specific counts of coliform and other bacteria in each water sample and also served as a transport media from the wilderness to the laboratory. On return to the laboratory, bacteria were harvested from the samplers and subjected to specific identification and qualitative analysis using standard microbiology techniques for the analysis of water.

Results
Coliform bacteria were detected in 22 of the 55 sites. All of these sites were below areas used by backpackers or pack animals. Thirty-three sites were free of coliforms. These sites included both those used lightly by backpackers and those with no human or domestic animal use. All samples contained expected amounts of normal aquatic bacteria including Pseudomonas, Rahnella aquatilis, Serratia spp, and nonpathogenic species of Yersinia.

Conclusions
Most sampling sites in these national parks are free of coliform or pathogenic organisms. Low levels of coliform bacteria are found in some bodies of water where the watershed has been affected by human or pack animal travel.},

revealed under all circumstances but is linked to specific psychological conditions. Specifically, we discuss
to what extent memory consolidation during sleep depends on the type of learning materials, type of
learning and retrieval test, different features of sleep and the subject population. Post-learning sleep
enhances consolidation of declarative, procedural and emotional memories. The enhancement is greater
for weakly than strongly encoded associations and more consistent for explicitly than implicitly encoded
memories. Memories associated with expected reward gain preferentially access to sleep-dependent
consolidation. For declarative memories, sleep benefits are more consistently revealed with recall than
recognition procedures at retrieval testing. Slow wave sleep (SWS) particularly enhances declarative
memories whereas rapid eye movement (REM) sleep preferentially supports procedural and emotional
memory aspects. Declarative memory profits already from rather short sleep periods (1–2 h). Procedural
memory profits seem more dose-dependent on the amount of sleep following the day after learning.
Children’s sleep with high amounts of SWS distinctly enhances declarative memories whereas elderly and
psychiatric patients with disturbed sleep show impaired sleep-associated consolidation often of declar-
ative memories. Based on the constellation of psychological conditions identified we hypothesize that
access to sleep-dependent consolidation requires memories to be encoded under control of prefrontal-
hippocampal circuitry, with the same circuitry controlling subsequent consolidation during sleep.},

Cutinases are serine hydrolases that degrade cutin, a polyester of fatty acids that is the main component of plant cuticle. These biocatalysts have recently attracted increased biotechnological interest due to their potential to modify and degrade polyethylene terephthalate (PET), as well as other synthetic polymers.
Methods
A cutinase from the mesophilic fungus Fusarium oxysporum, named FoCut5a, was expressed either in the cytoplasm or periplasm of Escherichia coli BL21. Its X-ray structure was determined to 1.9Ã resolution using molecular replacement. The activity of the recombinant enzyme was tested on a variety of synthetic esters and polyester analogues.
Results
The highest production of recombinant FoCut5a was achieved using periplasmic expression at 16Â°C. Its crystal structure is highly similar to previously determined Fusarium solani cutinase structure. However, a more detailed comparison of the surface properties and amino acid interactions revealed differences with potential impact on the biochemical properties of the two enzymes. FoCut5a showed maximum activity at 40Â°C and pH8.0, while it was active on three p-nitrophenyl synthetic esters of aliphatic acids (C2, C4, C12), with the highest catalytic efficiency for the hydrolysis of the butyl ester. The recombinant cutinase was also found capable of hydrolyzing PET model substrates and synthetic polymers.
Conclusions
The present work is the first reported expression and crystal structure determination of a functional cutinase from the mesophilic fungus F. oxysporum with potential application in surface modification of PET synthetic polymers.
General significance
FoCut5a could be used as a biocatalyst in industrial applications for the environmentally-friendly treatment of synthetic polymers.},

  abstract      = {ABSTRACTThe authors explored whether a testing effect occurs not only for retention of facts but also for application of principles and procedures. For that purpose, 38 high school students either repeatedly studied a text on probability calculations or studied the text, took a test on the content, restudied the text, and finally took the test a second time. Results show that testing not only leads to better retention of facts than restudying, but also to better application of acquired knowledge (i.e., principles and procedures) in high school statistics. In other words, testing seems not only to benefit fact retention, but also positively affects deeper learning.},

Although the testing effect is among the most robust findings in cognitive science, much of its empirical support is from laboratory studies and it has been applied as a strategy for enhancing learning in the classroom in a limited fashion. The purpose of this investigation was to replicate the testing effect in a university anatomy and physiology course and to extend the applicability of it to independent student study. Students repeatedly studied three sets of passages that described structures and concepts pertaining to (1) cardiac electrophysiology, (2) ventilation and (3) endocrinology. Each student was randomly assigned to study one of those three passage sets by reading it three consecutive times (R--R--R), another by reading and then rereading it while taking notes (R--RÂ +Â N) and the third by reading it, recalling as much as possible (i.e., self-testing) and then rereading it (R--T--R). Retention assessed after 1Â week was significantly greater following R--T--R (53.95Â {\textpm}Â 1.72) compared to R--R--R (48.04Â {\textpm}Â 1.83) and R--RÂ +Â N (48.31Â {\textpm}Â 1.78). Evidence is also presented that suggests students benefited from instructions to self-test when preparing for exams on their own.

Invasive mammalian predators are arguably the most damaging group of alien animal species for global biodiversity. Thirty species of invasive predator are implicated in the extinction or endangerment of 738 vertebrate species—collectively contributing to 58% of all bird, mammal, and reptile extinctions. Cats, rodents, dogs, and pigs have the most pervasive impacts, and endemic island faunas are most vulnerable to invasive predators. That most impacted species are insular indicates that management of invasive predators on islands should be a global conservation priority. Understanding and mitigating the impact of invasive mammalian predators is essential for reducing the rate of global biodiversity loss.

Abstract
Invasive species threaten biodiversity globally, and invasive mammalian predators are particularly damaging, having contributed to considerable species decline and extinction. We provide a global metaanalysis of these impacts and reveal their full extent. Invasive predators are implicated in 87 bird, 45 mammal, and 10 reptile species extinctions—58% of these groups’ contemporary extinctions worldwide. These figures are likely underestimated because 23 critically endangered species that we assessed are classed as “possibly extinct.” Invasive mammalian predators endanger a further 596 species at risk of extinction, with cats, rodents, dogs, and pigs threatening the most species overall. Species most at risk from predators have high evolutionary distinctiveness and inhabit insular environments. Invasive mammalian predators are therefore important drivers of irreversible loss of phylogenetic diversity worldwide. That most impacted species are insular indicates that management of invasive predators on islands should be a global conservation priority. Understanding and mitigating the impact of invasive mammalian predators is essential for reducing the rate of global biodiversity loss.},

Since a 24-h fast also depletes liver glycogen, we were interested in blood glucose homeostasis during exercise after fasting. An experiment was conducted with human subjects to determine the effect of fasting on blood metabolite concentrations during exercise. Nine male subjects ran (70\% maximum O2 consumption) two counterbalanced trials, once fed and once after a 23-h fast. Plasma glucose was elevated by exercise in the fasted trial but there was no difference between fed and fasted during exercise. Lactate was significantly higher (P less than 0.05) in fasted than fed throughout the exercise bout. Fat mobilization and utilization appeared to be greater in the fasted trial as evidenced by higher plasma concentrations of free fatty acids, glycerol, and beta-hydroxybutyrate as well as lower respiratory exchange ratio in the fasted trial during the first 30 min of exercise. These results demonstrate that in humans blood glucose concentration is maintained at normal levels during exercise after fasting despite the depletion of liver glycogen. Homeostasis is probably maintained as a result of increased gluconeogenesis and decreased utilization of glucose in the muscle as a result of lowered pyruvate dehydrogenase activity.},

Manufacturers have also played a role by setting limits on certain substances and developing mitigation procedures for process-induced toxins. Regardless of measures taken by regulators and food producers to protect consumers from natural food toxins, consumption of small levels of these materials is unavoidable.

Population-level shifts are occurring because of physiological intolerance to new environments, altered dispersal patterns, and changes in species interactions. Together with local climate-driven invasion and extinction, these processes result in altered community structure and diversity, including possible emergence of novel ecosystems. Impacts are particularly striking for the poles and the tropics, because of the sensitivity of polar ecosystems to sea-ice retreat and poleward species migrations as well as the sensitivity of coral-algal symbiosis to minor increases in temperature. Midlatitude upwelling systems, like the California Current, exhibit strong linkages between climate and species distributions, phenology, and demography. Aggregated effects may modify energy and material flows as well as biogeochemical cycles, eventually impacting the overall ecosystem functioning and services upon which people and societies depend.},

  abstract      = {AbstractBackground Among numerous health benefits, sports participation has been shown to reduce the risk of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents. Schools represent an ideal environment for increasing sports participation, but it is unclear how access and choice influence participation and whether characteristics of the school sports program differentially influence boys' and girls' participation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the characteristics of high school athletic programs and determine the extent to which these characteristics influenced boys' and girls' sports team participation. Methods Longitudinal telephone surveys were conducted with 1244 New Hampshire and Vermont students. Students self-reported their sports team participation at baseline (elementary school) and follow-up (high school). High school personnel were surveyed to assess sports opportunities, which were defined for this analysis as the number of sports offered per 100 students (i.e., choice) and the percent of sports offered that did not restrict the number of players (i.e., access). Results Approximately 70% of children participated on at least one sports team, including 73% of boys and 66% of girls. We detected statistically significant interactions between sex and two school opportunity variables: 1) the number of sports offered per 100 students (i.e., choice) and 2) the percent of sports offered that did not restrict the number of players (i.e., access). After controlling for children's baseline sports participation and other covariates, boys were more likely to play on at least one sports team per year if their school did not restrict participation in the most popular sports (relative risk, RRÂ =Â 1.12, pÂ &lt;Â 0.01); in contrast, girls were more likely to play on at least one sports team per year if their school offered a wider variety of sports (RRÂ =Â 1.47, pÂ &lt;Â 0.001). Conclusion Sports participation has previously been shown to confer a number of health benefits; as such, school sports programs may be an important, effective, and underused target for public health efforts, including obesity prevention programs. Efforts to increase physical activity among youth should consider both access and choice in school athletic programs. Schools may need to use different strategies to increase sports participation in boys and girls. },

  abstract      = {There is extensive literature on avian mortality due to collision with man-made structures, including wind turbines, communication masts, tall buildings and windows, power lines, and fences. Many studies describe the consequences of bird-strike rather than address the causes, and there is little data based on long-term, standardized, and systematic assessments. Despite these limitations, it is apparent that bird-strike is a significant cause of mortality. It is therefore important to understand the effects of this mortality on bird populations. The factors which determine avian collision risk are described, including location, structural attributes, such as height and the use of lighting, weather conditions, and bird morphology and behavior. The results of incidental and more systematic observations of bird-strike due to a range of structures are presented and the implications of collision mortality for bird populations, particularly those of scarce and threatened species susceptible to collisions, are discussed. Existing measures for reducing collision mortality are described, both generally and specifically for each type of structure. It is concluded that, in some circumstances, collision mortality can adversely affect bird populations, and that greater effort is needed to derive accurate estimates of mortality levels locally, regionally, and nationally to better assess impacts on avian populations. Priority areas for future work are suggested, including further development of remote technology to monitor collisions, research into the causes of bird-strike, and the design of new, effective mitigation measures.

  abstract      = {Many students are being left behind by an educational system that some people believe is in crisis. Improving educational outcomes will require efforts on many fronts, but a central premise of this monograph is that one part of a solution involves helping students to better regulate their learning through the use of effective learning techniques. Fortunately, cognitive and educational psychologists have been developing and evaluating easy-to-use learning techniques that could help students achieve their learning goals. In this monograph, we discuss 10 learning techniques in detail and offer recommendations about their relative utility. We selected techniques that were expected to be relatively easy to use and hence could be adopted by many students. Also, some techniques (e.g., highlighting and rereading) were selected because students report relying heavily on them, which makes it especially important to examine how well they work. The techniques include elaborative interrogation, self-explanation, summarization, highlighting (or underlining), the keyword mnemonic, imagery use for text learning, rereading, practice testing, distributed practice, and interleaved practice.To offer recommendations about the relative utility of these techniques, we evaluated whether their benefits generalize across four categories of variables: learning conditions, student characteristics, materials, and criterion tasks. Learning conditions include aspects of the learning environment in which the technique is implemented, such as whether a student studies alone or with a group. Student characteristics include variables such as age, ability, and level of prior knowledge. Materials vary from simple concepts to mathematical problems to complicated science texts. Criterion tasks include different outcome measures that are relevant to student achievement, such as those tapping memory, problem solving, and comprehension.We attempted to provide thorough reviews for each technique, so this monograph is rather lengthy. However, we also wrote the monograph in a modular fashion, so it is easy to use. In particular, each review is divided into the following sections: General description of the technique and why it should workHow general are the effects of this technique? â2a. Learning conditionsâ2b. Student characteristicsâ2c. Materialsâ2d. Criterion tasksEffects in representative educational contextsIssues for implementationOverall assessmentThe review for each technique can be read independently of the others, and particular variables of interest can be easily compared across techniques.To foreshadow our final recommendations, the techniques vary widely with respect to their generalizability and promise for improving student learning. Practice testing and distributed practice received high utility assessments because they benefit learners of different ages and abilities and have been shown to boost studentsâ performance across many criterion tasks and even in educational contexts. Elaborative interrogation, self-explanation, and interleaved practice received moderate utility assessments. The benefits of these techniques do generalize across some variables, yet despite their promise, they fell short of a high utility assessment because the evidence for their efficacy is limited. For instance, elaborative interrogation and self-explanation have not been adequately evaluated in educational contexts, and the benefits of interleaving have just begun to be systematically explored, so the ultimate effectiveness of these techniques is currently unknown. Nevertheless, the techniques that received moderate-utility ratings show enough promise for us to recommend their use in appropriate situations, which we describe in detail within the review of each technique.Five techniques received a low utility assessment: summarization, highlighting, the keyword mnemonic, imagery use for text learning, and rereading. These techniques were rated as low utility for numerous reasons. Summarization and imagery use for text learning have been shown to help some students on some criterion tasks, yet the conditions under which these techniques produce benefits are limited, and much research is still needed to fully explore their overall effectiveness. The keyword mnemonic is difficult to implement in some contexts, and it appears to benefit students for a limited number of materials and for short retention intervals. Most students report rereading and highlighting, yet these techniques do not consistently boost studentsâ performance, so other techniques should be used in their place (e.g., practice testing instead of rereading).Our hope is that this monograph will foster improvements in student learning, not only by showcasing which learning techniques are likely to have the most generalizable effects but also by encouraging researchers to continue investigating the most promising techniques. Accordingly, in our closing remarks, we discuss some issues for how these techniques could be implemented by teachers and students, and we highlight directions for future research.},

  abstract      = {Deficits in daytime performance due to sleep loss are experienced universally and
associated with a significant social, financial, and human cost. Microsleeps, sleep attacks,
and lapses in cognition increase with sleep loss as a function of state instability. Sleep
deprivation studies repeatedly show a variable (negative) impact on mood, cognitive
performance, and motor function due to an increasing sleep propensity and destabilization
of the wake state. Specific neurocognitive domains including executive attention, working
memory, and divergent higher cognitive functions are particularly vulnerable to sleep loss.
In humans, functional metabolic and neurophysiological studies demonstrate that neural
systems involved in executive function (i.e., prefrontal cortex) are more susceptible to sleep
deprivation in some individuals than others. Recent chronic partial sleep deprivation
experiments, which more closely replicate sleep loss in society, demonstrate that profound
neurocognitive deficits accumulate over time in the face of subjective adaptation to the
sensation of sleepiness. Sleep deprivation associated with disease-related sleep fragmentation
(i.e., sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome) also results in neurocognitive performance
decrements similar to those seen in sleep restriction studies. Performance deficits associated
with sleep disorders are often viewed as a simple function of disease severity; however,
recent experiments suggest that individual vulnerability to sleep loss may play a more
critical role than previously thought.

In 1990, research showing an association between physical punishment and negative developmental outcomes was starting to accumulate, and the Convention on the Rights of the Child had just been adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations; however, only four countries had prohibited physical punishment in all settings.

By 2000, research was proliferating, and the convention had been ratified by 191 of the world’s 196 countries, 11 of which had prohibited all physical punishment. Today, research showing the risks associated with physical punishment is robust, the convention has been integrated into the legal and policy frameworks of many nations, and 31 countries have enacted prohibitions against the physical punishment of children.1 These three forces — research, the convention and law reform — have altered the landscape of physical punishment.

The growing weight of evidence and the recognition of children’s rights have brought us to a historical point. Physicians familiar with the research can now confidently encourage parents to adopt constructive approaches to discipline and can comfortably use their unique influence to guide other aspects of children’s healthy development. In doing so, physicians strengthen child well-being and parent–child relationships at the population level. Here, we present an analysis of the research on physical punishment spanning the past two decades to assist physicians in this important role.},

Periodic additions of a top predator (predatory clerid beetle) to a wet forest understory shrub caused a reduction in the predatory beetle's prey (a predatory ant), increased herbivory, and reduced leaf area of the plant. These effects occurred whether beetles were added to naturally occurring shrubs or to reproductive fragments, suggesting fitness effects of top predators through three trophic levels. A correlational study showed that trophic effects of top predators also cascaded to nearby conspecifics in the forest understory. We use trends from understory plant surveys to suggest mechanisms by which these cascades could ultimately affect species diversity in the local plant community.

The present qualitative study makes use of a broad-spectrum ecological model in the search for aetiological factors underlying behavioural disturbance. The study covers 34 typical Danish schools matched in pairs on the basis of degree of disturbance in the national survey. The results indicate behavioural problems to be related more to system factors than to purely individual factors.

  abstract      = {The present article reviews 42 studies investigating the role of sequencing of text and pictures for learning outcomes. Whereas several of the reviewed studies revealed better learning outcomes from presenting the picture before the text rather than after it, other studies demonstrated the opposite effect. Against the backdrop of theories on memory representations, these results are explained by a recency effect: that is, recall of information should be superior for the medium (text or picture) presented second, and thus, in closer temporal proximity to the assessment. As a consequence, the type of knowledge assessed (text-based vs. picture-based) and its congruence with the more recent medium should determine whether better learning results are found when presenting the picture or text first. Against the backdrop of theories on mental model construction, results were explained by a facilitation effect for the medium (text or picture) presented second. As a consequence, the relative complexity of information conveyed by the picture and by the text should determine which medium is better to be processed first, with less complex information being processed first leading to better comprehension. To conclude, the review suggests that it is not so much the sequence of text and pictures per se that affects learning outcomes than these boundary conditions (i.e., type of assessed knowledge, relative complexity of text, and picture). Accordingly, the present review seeks to stimulate further research along the boundary conditions to better understand the processes involved when learning with text and pictures.},

  abstract      = {Weight loss is difficult to achieve and maintaining the weight loss is an even greater challenge. The identification of factors associated with weight loss maintenance can enhance our understanding for the behaviours and prerequisites that are crucial in sustaining a lowered body weight. In this paper we have reviewed the literature on factors associated with weight loss maintenance and weight regain. We have used a definition of weight maintenance implying intentional weight loss that has subsequently been maintained for at least 6Â months. According to our review, successful weight maintenance is associated with more initial weight loss, reaching a self-determined goal weight, having a physically active lifestyle, a regular meal rhythm including breakfast and healthier eating, control of over-eating and self-monitoring of behaviours. Weight maintenance is further associated with an internal motivation to lose weight, social support, better coping strategies and ability to handle life stress, self-efficacy, autonomy, assuming responsibility in life, and overall more psychological strength and stability. Factors that may pose a risk for weight regain include a history of weight cycling, disinhibited eating, binge eating, more hunger, eating in response to negative emotions and stress, and more passive reactions to problems.},

  abstract      = {Aims A global increase in diabetes is predicted due to higher body weight and less physical activity. Over the period 1986â1999, the body mass index (BMI) of the adult population of northern Sweden increased from 25.3 to 26.2 and the prevalence of obesity (BMI â¥Â 30) from 11% to 15%, although this was more distal than central adiposity. Our hypothesis was that this would lead to a higher prevalence of diabetes.Methods Four population surveys with new and independent cohorts of 2000 invited subjects, 25â64Â years old, in 1986, 1990, 1994 and 1999. In the first three surveys an oral glucose tolerance test was carried out in 47%.Results Over the time period 1986â1999 there was no increase in the prevalence of known diabetes. No trends were noted in the finding of previously undiagnosed diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance over the period 1986â1994, although the confidence intervals are wide. Fasting, but not post-load, glucose levels increased with 0.040Â mmol/year (95% CI 0.026; 0.055) in men and 0.033Â mmol/year (0.023; 0.044) in women.Conclusion In spite of a marked increase in BMI, we found no increased prevalence of known diabetes over a 13-year observation period, although our data cannot exclude minor increases in undiagnosed diabetes. The development of more distal than abdominal obesity, a diet with less saturated fat and lower glycaemic index and fewer regular smokers in the population may contribute to this. The effects of obesity may thus be attenuated by other secular trends in society and highlight potential ways of curbing the worldwide increase in diabetes.},

Metabolism of BPA to the monoglucuronide will determine the extent of its estrogenicity in vivo. Investigation of the metabolism of BPA (500 {micro}M) by isolated female rat hepatocytes confirmed the formation of BPA glucuronide as the major metabolite. There was a significant difference (p < 0.05) between the Vmax (mean {+/-} S.E.M., n = 4) of glucuronidation by pooled male or female human (four livers in each case) and immature female rat liver microsomes (5.9 {+/-} 0.4, 5.2 {+/-} 0.3, and 31.6 {+/-} 8.1 nmol/min/mg of protein, respectively). Estrogenic activity of BPA, assessed in a coupled microsomal metabolism-yeast estrogenicity assay, was decreased 3- and 7-fold following glucuronidation by human female and immature female rat liver microsomes, respectively. Incubations of BPA with pooled human or rat liver microsomes, in the presence of NADPH, resulted in the formation of 5-hydroxybisphenol A [2-(4,5-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane], which was 10-fold less potent than BPA in the yeast estrogenicity assay. However, there was insufficient turnover to achieve a significant effect on the estrogenic activity of BPA. Because human liver microsomes did not glucuronidate BPA as extensively as the rat liver microsomes, estrogen target tissues in humans may be subject to greater exposure to BPA than the tissues of the immature female rats used for assessing estrogenicity of xenobiotics. },

This kind of evaluation scheme has, however, elicited resistance from teachers. The aims of this article are to explain the advent of teaching evaluation policies in Norway and to explore which factors explain teacher resistance to teaching evaluation schemes. Structural equation modelling of teacher survey data shows which factors are statistically associated with the concept of teacher resistance to teaching evaluation. Teacher stress and resistance are positively associated with the perceived controlling purpose of teaching evaluation rather than the evaluation itself. Teacher resistance is clearly negatively associated with their acknowledgement of students’ feedback and their perception of the communication with leadership. Further, the model shows moderately strong negative pathways between the perceived control purposes of teaching evaluation and acknowledgement of students’ feedback on the one hand and the perceived control purposes of teaching evaluation and perception of clear communication of goals on the other hand. Teachers’ acknowledgement of the students’ feedback is weakly negatively associated with teacher stress. The implications for practice and further research are discussed.

The effect of climbin Mount Everest on spleen contraction and increase in hemoglobin concentration during breath holding and exercise. High Alt Med Biol. 15:52â57, 2014.âRelease of stored red blood cells resulting from spleen contraction improves human performance in various hypoxic situations. This study determined spleen volume resulting from two contraction-evoking stimuli: breath holding and exercise before and after altitude acclimatization during a Mount Everest ascent (8848âm). Eight climbers performed the following protocol before and after the climb: 5âmin ambient air respiration at 1370âm during rest, 20âmin oxygen respiration, 20âmin ambient air respiration at 1370âm, three maximal-effort breath holds spaced by 2âmin, 10âmin ambient air respiration, 5âmin of cycling at 100 W, and finally 10âmin ambient air respiration. We measured spleen volume by ultrasound and capillary hemoglobin (HB) concentration after each exposure, and heart rate (HR) and arterial oxygen saturation (Sao2) continuously. Mean (SD) baseline spleen volume was unchanged at 213 (101) mL before and 206 (52) mL after the climb. Before the climb, spleen volume was reduced to 184 (83) mL after three breath holds, and after the climb three breath holds resulted in a spleen volume of 132 (26) mL (p=0.032). After exercise, the preclimb spleen volume was 186 (89) mL vs. 112 (389) mL) after the climb (p=0.003). Breath hold duration and cardiovascular responses were unchanged after the climb. We concluded that spleen contraction may be enhanced by altitude acclimatization, probably reflecting both the acclimatization to chronic hypoxic exposure and acute hypoxia during physical work.},

Antonovsky’s life orientation questionnaire/sense of coherence scale (SOC).
Design: The study is descriptive and analytical with a systematic integration of the contemporary
knowledge base on the salutogenic research published 1992–2003. The review includes 458 scientific
publications and 13 doctoral theses.
Setting: Worldwide, based on postgraduate scientific publications in eight authorised databases, doctoral
theses, and available books.
Main results: The SOC questionnaire has been used in at least 33 languages in 32 countries with at least
15 different versions of the questionnaire. In 124 studies using SOC-29 the Cronbach’s a ranges from
0.70 to 0.95. The a values in 127 studies using SOC-13 range from 0.70 to 0.92, and in 60 studies using
a modified SOC scale range from 0.35 to 0.91. Test-retest correlation show stability and range from 0.69
to 0.78 (1 year), 0.64 (3 years), 0.42 to 0.45 (4 years), 0.59 to 0.67 (5 years) to 0.54 (10 years). The
means of SOC-29 range 100.50 (SD 28.50) to 164.50 (SD 17.10) points and SOC-13 from 35.39 (SD
0.10) to 77.60 (SD 13.80) points. After 10 years SOC seems to be comparatively stable, but not as stable
as Antonovsky initially assumed. SOC tends to increase with age. The factorial structure of SOC seems
rather to be multidimensional than unidimensional. SOC predicts a positive outcome in a long term
perspective, although there are divergent findings reported. The SOC scale seems to be a reliable, valid,
and cross culturally applicable instrument measuring how people manage stressful situations and stay well.},

The aim of the study was to test the serotonin hypothesis of this disorder, i.e. of an association between premenstrual decline in brain serotonin function and concomitant worsening of self-rated cardinal mood symptoms. Positron emission tomography was used to assess changes in brain trapping of 11C-labeled 5-hydroxytryptophan, the immediate precursor of serotonin, in the follicular and premenstrual phases of the menstrual cycle in eight women with premenstrual dysphoria. Changes in mood and physical symptoms were assessed from daily visual analog scale ratings. Worsening of cardinal mood symptoms showed significant inverse associations with changes in brain serotonin precursor trapping; for the symptom birritableQ, rs=0.83, and for bdepressed moodQ rs=0.81. Positive mood variables showed positive associations, whereas physical symptoms generally displayed weak or no associations. The data indicate strong inverse associations between worsening of cardinal symptoms of premenstrual dysphoria and brain serotonin precursor (11C-labeled 5-hydroxytryptophan) trapping. The results may in part support a role for serotonin in premenstrual dysphoria and may provide a clue to the effectiveness of serotonin-augmenting drugs in this disorder but should, due to small sample size and methodological shortcomings, be considered preliminary.},

Methods The present study reports supplementary analysis of an already described and published study. Data were provided by a nonclinical sample of 98 normal-active adults with chronic initiating and the maintaining of sleep complaints. The additional analysis included sleep log, exercise log, and daily pedometer data which were collected during a baseline week and 6-week of a combined intervention. Results The results indicate that the number of steps (pÂ =Â 0.02) and the duration of \{PA\} (pÂ =Â 0.01) is significantly related to the improvement in subjective sleep measures and therefore reveal an independent effect within this combined sleep program. Sleep diary data (recuperation of sleep, number of awakenings after sleep onset, and wake time after sleep onset time) improved significant (all pÂ &lt;Â 0.01) over the intervention program. About 50% of the participants stated that the \{PA\} had an effect on their improvement. Conclusion Improvements on subjective sleep quality after a combined intervention cannot be attributed to the cognitive component alone, but \{PA\} has an independent effect. Adults with chronic sleep complaints benefit from exercise. Therefore structured \{PA\} should be implemented in any sleep management programs. },

  abstract      = {Research suggests that the relationship between school bullying and its various risk factors should be clearer among girls than boys, and should become stronger with age, as roles within the peer group stabilise. This paper tests this theory by comparing sex, school type, and bully/victim status differences in friendships and playground social interactions, using data from nine surveys in seven countries: China, England, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Portugal, and Spain. A total of approximately 48,000 children completed various translations of the Olweus Bullying Questionnaire. Small but generally consistent main effects were found for sex and school type (boys and primary pupils enjoyed playtimes more and had more friends, but were also more likely to spend playtimes alone). Larger effects were consistently found for bully/victim status (victims were significantly worse off on all the measures in all the samples where a difference was found, while bullies and neutrals did not differ consistently), but the interactions between these factors varied widely between samples and there were few consistent patterns. It is concluded that bullying is a universal phenomenon with many negative correlates for victims and few (if any) for bullies, but that there are cultural variations in the way that bullying is related to sex, age, and social support.

  abstract      = {Caffeine and theobromine are purine alkaloids widely consumed as stimulants and snacks in coffee and cocoa based foods and most often as part of ingredients in drugs. Man has enjoyed a long history of consumption of caffeine and theobromine. Recent interest in these two alkoloids, however, is centered on their potential reproductive toxicities. Caffeine and theobromine are now known to cross the placental and blood brain barrier thus potentially inducing fetal malformation by affecting the expression of genes vital in development. The developing fetus may not have developed enzymes for detoxification of these methylxanthine alkaloids via demethylation. There is a need, therefore, to protect the conceptus against insults from teratogens of this nature. Apart from its reproductive toxicity, the presence of caffeine and theobromine in cocoa could limit its potentials as a nourishing food. This is an issue that needs to be addressed by nutritionists and the food industry at large. This paper discusses the natural sources, consumption and uses, toxicity and the major advances in the reproductive toxicology of caffeine and theobromine. The biosynthesis of these compounds in plants, metabolism in mammalian systems and the involvement of cytochrome P450 are reviewed and summarized. Evidence in favor of the toxicity of these compounds in experimental animals is presented with emphasis on the implications of these findings in humans. The paper concludes with a call for caution in the use of caffeine and theobromine pending further and more elaborate investigations.},

  abstract      = {Abstract Optimising training and performance through nutrition strategies is central to supporting elite sportspeople, much of which has focused on manipulating the relative intake of carbohydrate and fat and their contributions as fuels for energy provision. The ketone bodies, namely acetoacetate, acetone and Î²âhydroxybutyrate (Î²HB), are produced in the liver during conditions of reduced carbohydrate availability and serve as an alternative fuel source for peripheral tissues including brain, heart and skeletal muscle. Ketone bodies are oxidised as a fuel source during exercise, are markedly elevated during the postâexercise recovery period, and the ability to utilise ketone bodies is higher in exerciseâtrained skeletal muscle. The metabolic actions of ketone bodies can alter fuel selection through attenuating glucose utilisation in peripheral tissues, antiâlipolytic effects on adipose tissue, and attenuation of proteolysis in skeletal muscle. Moreover, ketone bodies can act as signalling metabolites, with Î²HB acting as an inhibitor of histone deacetylases, an important regulator of the adaptive response to exercise in skeletal muscle. Recent development of ketone esters facilitates acute ingestion of Î²HB that results in nutritional ketosis without necessitating restrictive dietary practices. Initial reports suggest this strategy alters the metabolic response to exercise and improves exercise performance, while other lines of evidence suggest roles in recovery from exercise. The present review focuses on the physiology of ketone bodies during and after exercise and in response to training, with specific interest in exploring the physiological basis for exogenous ketone supplementation and potential benefits for performance and recovery in athletes.},

Background: Consumer-wearable activity trackers are electronic devices used for monitoring fitness- and other
health-related metrics. The purpose of this systematic review was to summarize the evidence for validity and
reliability of popular consumer-wearable activity trackers (Fitbit and Jawbone) and their ability to estimate steps,
distance, physical activity, energy expenditure, and sleep.
Methods: Searches included only full-length English language studies published in PubMed, Embase, SPORTDiscus,
and Google Scholar through July 31, 2015. Two people reviewed and abstracted each included study.
Results: In total, 22 studies were included in the review (20 on adults, 2 on youth). For laboratory-based studies
using step counting or accelerometer steps, the correlation with tracker-assessed steps was high for both Fitbit and
Jawbone (Pearson or intraclass correlation coefficients (CC) > =0.80). Only one study assessed distance for the Fitbit,
finding an over-estimate at slower speeds and under-estimate at faster speeds. Two field-based studies compared
accelerometry-assessed physical activity to the trackers, with one study finding higher correlation (Spearman CC
0.86, Fitbit) while another study found a wide range in correlation (intraclass CC 0.36–0.70, Fitbit and Jawbone).
Using several different comparison measures (indirect and direct calorimetry, accelerometry, self-report), energy
expenditure was more often under-estimated by either tracker. Total sleep time and sleep efficiency were over-
estimated and wake after sleep onset was under-estimated comparing metrics from polysomnography to either
tracker using a normal mode setting. No studies of intradevice reliability were found. Interdevice reliability was
reported on seven studies using the Fitbit, but none for the Jawbone. Walking- and running-based Fitbit trials
indicated consistently high interdevice reliability for steps (Pearson and intraclass CC 0.76–1.00), distance (intraclass
CC 0.90–0.99), and energy expenditure (Pearson and intraclass CC 0.71–0.97). When wearing two Fitbits while
sleeping, consistency between the devices was high.
Conclusion: This systematic review indicated higher validity of steps, few studies on distance and physical activity,
and lower validity for energy expenditure and sleep. The evidence reviewed indicated high interdevice reliability for
steps, distance, energy expenditure, and sleep for certain Fitbit models. As new activity trackers and features are
introduced to the market, documentation of the measurement properties can guide their use in research settings.

  abstract      = {Background. Foodborne botulism resulting from consumption of uncooked aquatic game foods has been an endemic hazard among Alaska Native populations for centuries. Our review was conducted to help target botulism prevention and response activities.

Methods. Records of Alaska botulism investigations for the period 1947–2007 were reviewed. We used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention case definitions for foodborne botulism and linear regression to evaluate incidence trends and χ2 or Fisher's Exact tests to evaluate categorical data.

Results. A total of 317 patients (61% of whom were female) and 159 outbreaks were reported. Overall mean annual incidence was 6.9 cases per 100,000 Alaska Native persons; mean incidence was lower in 2000 (5.7 cases per 100,000 Alaska Native persons) than in any period since 1965–1969 (0.8 cases per 100,000 Alaska Native persons). Age-specific incidence was highest (26.6 cases per 100,000 Alaska Native persons) among persons aged ≥60 years. The overall case-fatality rate was 8.2%, and the case-fatality rate was ≤4.0% since 1980. Misdiagnosis was associated with a higher case-fatality rate and delayed antitoxin administration.

Conclusions. Foodborne botulism remains a public health problem in Alaska. Incidence might be decreasing, but it remains >800 times the overall US rate (0.0068 cases per 100,000 persons). Prevention messages should highlight the additional risk to female individuals and older persons. Early diagnosis is critical for timely access to antitoxin and supportive care.},

We demonstrate that the sea ice cover in the Arctic Ocean has provided a strong signal for climate-induced changes on the adjacent caribou summer ranges, outperforming other climate indices in explaining the caribou-plant dynamics. We found no evidence of a negative effect of caribou abundance on vegetation biomass. On the contrary, we found a strong bottom-up effect in which a warmer climate related to diminishing sea ice has increased the plant biomass on the summer pastures, along with a paradoxical decline in caribou populations. This result suggests that this climate-induced greening has been accompanied by a deterioration of pasture quality. The shrub expansion in Arctic North America involves plant species with strong antibrowsing defenses. Our results might therefore be an early signal of a climate-driven shift in the caribou-plant interaction from a system with low plant biomass modulated by cyclic caribou populations to a system dominated by nonedible shrubs and diminishing herds of migratory caribou.},

  abstract      = {Abstract There is increasing concern for sleeplessness-related risks in modern society. Some recent epidemiological data seem to support the view that many segments of the adult population have chronically inadequate sleep. On the other hand, some experts have claimed that our core, basic amount of sleep is around 6 h per night, and that the rest of our sleep can be easily curtailed, being unnecessary to fulfill any sleep need. However, experimental data on the effects of both acute and cumulative partial sleep deprivation (PSD) consistently point out that sleep restriction has substantial negative effects on sleepiness, motor and cognitive performance and mood, as well as on some metabolic, hormonal and immunological variables. As chronic PSD may have serious long-term adverse health effects, it should be avoided in the general population. In the short-term, the effects of sleep curtailment seem to accumulate linearly, while the effects of long-term PSD should be further investigated, as the few available studies are flawed by methodological weaknesses. On the other hand, there is evidence that extending sleep by 2â3 h beyond the norm produces only marginal benefits for an average individual. Finally, it is underlined that, as large individual differences do exist in the need for sleep, the search for the sleep need may be vain. A somnotypology, taking into account age, gender and the position in both the sleepâalert and the morningnessâeveningness continuum, should help in the search for the actual individual sleep need. 2001 Harcourt Publishers Ltd},

In overnight-fasted subjects, exercise increased the rate of turnover (+125\% after 2 h) and the metabolic clearance rate of ketone bodies whose concentration rose from 0.20 to 0.39 mM. Discontinuation of exercise was associated with a marked increase in ketone levels (+0.73 mM after 30 min of recovery) that was related to a further stimulation of ketogenesis (+19\%) and to a marked drop of the metabolic clearance rate to below preexercise values. In sharp contrast with overnight-fasted subjects, starved subjects (with a resting ketone level averaging 5.7 mM) responded to work by a decrease in the turnover rate and in the concentration of ketones, their metabolic clearance rate remaining unchanged. Thus, the response of ketogenesis and muscular ketone uptake to exercise are both markedly influenced by the initial degree of fasting ketosis.},

Answering these questions requires long-term, high-resolution data that are vanishingly rare. We combined the analysis of environmental DNA extracted from a lake sediment core, coprophilous fungi, and sedimentological analyses to reconstruct 600 years of ecosystem dynamics on a sub-Antarctic island and to identify the impact of invasive rabbits. Plant communities remained stable from AD 1400 until the 1940s, when the DNA of invasive rabbits was detected in sediments. Rabbit detection corresponded to abrupt changes of plant communities, with a continuous decline of a dominant plant species. Furthermore, erosion rate abruptly increased with rabbit abundance. Rabbit impacts were very fast and were stronger than the effects of climate change during the 20th century. Lake sediments can allow an integrated temporal analysis of ecosystems, revealing the impact of invasive species over time and improving our understanding of underlying mechanisms.},

Setting and Participants Telephone interviews with a nationally representative sample of 2030 youth aged 10 to 17 years who were asked about lifetime adversities and current distress symptoms.

Main Outcome Measures Lifetime adversities and current distress symptoms.

Results The adversities from the original ACE scale items were associated with mental health symptoms among the participants, but the association was significantly improved (from R2 = 0.21 to R2 = 0.34) by removing some of the original ACE scale items and adding others in the domains of peer rejection, peer victimization, community violence exposure, school performance, and socioeconomic status.

Conclusions Our understanding of the most harmful childhood adversities is still incomplete because of complex interrelationships among them, but we know enough to proceed to interventional studies to determine whether prevention and remediation can improve long-term outcomes.},

Here, we use fine-scale imaging and a mini- mal mathematical model to study sperm aggregation in the rodent genus Peromyscus. We demonstrate that as the number of sperm cells in an aggregate increase, the group moves with more persistent linearity but without increas- ing speed. This benefit, however, is offset in larger aggregates as the geometry of the group forces sperm to swim against one another. The result is a non- monotonic relationship between aggregate size and average velocity with both a theoretically predicted and empirically observed optimum of six to seven sperm per aggregate. To understand the role of sexual selection in driv- ing these sperm group dynamics, we compared two sister-species with divergent mating systems. We find that sperm of Peromyscus maniculatus (highly promiscuous), which have evolved under intense competition, form optimal-sized aggregates more often than sperm of Peromyscus polionotus (strictly monogamous), which lack competition. Our combined mathematical and experimental study of coordinated sperm movement reveals the impor- tance of geometry, motion and group size on sperm velocity and suggests how these physical variables interact with evolutionary selective pressures to regulate cooperation in competitive environments.},

We have previously concluded that the use of the Antonovsky Sense of Coherence (SOC) scale was unable to document a predicted strong association between SOC and physical health. By way of statistical methods numerous studies have investigated the validity, reliability, and applicability of the SOC scale with positive results. However, this paper analyses whether the questions in the SOC scale actually represent the universe of factors necessary to describe the phenomenon of SOC, which we believe is an important supplement to the statistically means of investigating validity and reliability. In this paper we explore the idea, the concepts, the theory and the operationalization behind the SOC Scale. The conclusions are: 1) it seems that Antonovsky's basic idea of coherence, for which he coined the term sense of coherence, as the basis for the highly popular salutogenic orientation is outstandingly good, in spite of the lack of statistical evidence; 2) the chosen key explanatory concepts of comprehensibility, manageability, and meaning, seems to be a fair, although mental, conceptualization of this idea; 3) Antonovsky's theory was unfortunately much less clear, as Antonovsky assumed predictability to be very important for the sense of coherence, especially for comprehensibility and manageability. This notion of predictability leaves its footprints in his operationalization of SOC into the SOC Scale. Our analysis convinced us that the SOC scale is unlikely to be a fair materialization of the idea of coherence and thus unlikely to measure SOC correctly.

  abstract      = {The gene ARHGAP11B promotes basal progenitor amplification and is implicated in neocortex expansion. It arose on the human evolutionary lineage by partial duplication of ARHGAP11A, which encodes a Rho guanosine triphosphatase{\textendash}activating protein (RhoGAP). However, a lack of 55 nucleotides in ARHGAP11B mRNA leads to loss of RhoGAP activity by GAP domain truncation and addition of a human-specific carboxy-terminal amino acid sequence. We show that these 55 nucleotides are deleted by mRNA splicing due to a single C{\textrightarrow}G substitution that creates a novel splice donor site. We reconstructed an ancestral ARHGAP11B complementary DNA without this substitution. Ancestral ARHGAP11B exhibits RhoGAP activity but has no ability to increase basal progenitors during neocortex development. Hence, a single nucleotide substitution underlies the specific properties of ARHGAP11B that likely contributed to the evolutionary expansion of the human neocortex.},

add citations that are not pertinent to their work and some authors pad their reference lists
with superfluous citations. How prevalent are these types of manipulation, why do scholars
stoop to such practices, and who among us is most susceptible to such ethical lapses? This
study builds a framework around how intense competition for limited journal space and
research funding can encourage manipulation and then uses that framework to develop
hypotheses about who manipulates and why they do so. We test those hypotheses using
data from over 12,000 responses to a series of surveys sent to more than 110,000 scholars
from eighteen different disciplines spread across science, engineering, social science, busi-
ness, and health care. We find widespread misattribution in publications and in research
proposals with significant variation by academic rank, discipline, sex, publication history, co-
authors, etc. Even though the majority of scholars disapprove of such tactics, many feel
pressured to make such additions while others suggest that it is just the way the game is
played. The findings suggest that certain changes in the review process might help to stem
this ethical decline, but progress could be slow.},

Participants: 3918 schoolchildren attending year 6 (mean age 11.88 years), year 8 (13.96), and year 10 (15.97) classes from 115 schools. Main outcome measures: Self reported bullying behaviours and psychological and p sychosomatic symptoms. Results: Almost a quarter of students (23.7\%) bullied other students, 12.7\% were bullied, 21.5\% were both bullied and bullied others on one or more occasions in the last term of school, and 42.4\% were neither bullied nor bullied others. Mor e boys than girls reported bullying others and being victims of bullying. Bullyi ng behaviour was associated with increased psychosomatic symptoms. Bullies tende d to be unhappy with school; students who were bullied tended to like school and to feel alone. Students who both bullied and were bullied had the greatest numb er of psychological and psychosomatic symptoms. Conclusions: Being bullied seems to be widespread in schools in New South Wales and is associated with increased psychosomatic symptoms and poor mental health. Health practitioners evaluating students with common psychological and psychosom atic symptoms should consider bullying and the student's school environment as p otential causes.

  abstract      = {Two related bet-hedging hypotheses have been proposed to explain the evolution of multiple mating by females. The first examines fitness of females within a single type of environment, and predicts that multiple mating can increase fitness by reducing the probability that all of a female’s eggs are fertilized by a poor-quality male. The second examines fitness across environments and predicts that females who mate multiple times reduce the probability that all of their eggs are fertilized by a male that is unsuited to the current environment. We tested whether multiple mating actually provides the fitness benefits predicted by bet-hedging models by comparing the geometric mean fitness across generations of half-sib versus full-sib families of the milkweed bug, Lygaeus kalmii, reared on three different host plants. The variance in mean fitness (egg-to-adult survivorship) was always lower for offspring in half-sib families than for offspring of full-sib families. This translated into an average increase in geometric mean fitness of 4.1% within environments and 1.3% among environments for offspring of multiple-mated versus once-mated parents. These fitness increases are sufficient to produce rapid replacement of a once-mating genotype by a multiple-mating genotype. We conclude that multiple mating by parents reduces variation in offspring fitness and increases geometric mean fitness. We suggest that bet-hedging hypotheses are viable explanations for at least some of the variation in mating frequency observed in insects.},

Owing to this feedback, at timescales ranging from interannual to the 20100-kyr cycles of Earth's orbital variations1, 5, 6, 7, warming of the climate system causes a net release of CO2 into the atmosphere; this in turn amplifies warming. But the magnitude of the climate sensitivity of the global carbon cycle (termed ), and thus of its positive feedback strength, is under debate, giving rise to large uncertainties in global warming projections8, 9. Here we quantify the median as 7.7p.p.m.v. CO2 per °C warming, with a likely range of 1.721.4p.p.m.v. CO2 per °C. Sensitivity experiments exclude significant influence of pre-industrial land-use change on these estimates. Our results, based on the coupling of a probabilistic approach with an ensemble of proxy-based temperature reconstructions and pre-industrial CO2 data from three ice cores, provide robust constraints for on the policy-relevant multi-decadal to centennial timescales. By using an ensemble of >200,000 members, quantification of is not only improved, but also likelihoods can be assigned, thereby providing a benchmark for future model simulations. Although uncertainties do not at present allow exclusion of calculated from any of ten coupled carbonclimate models, we find that is about twice as likely to fall in the lowermost than in the uppermost quartile of their range. Our results are incompatibly lower (P<0.05) than recent pre-industrial empirical estimates of ~40p.p.m.v. CO2 per °C (refs 6, 7), and correspondingly suggest ~80% less potential amplification of ongoing global warming. },

  abstract      = {Predators of highly defensive prey likely develop cost-reducing adaptations. The ant Megaponera analis is a
specialized termite predator, solely raiding termites of the subfamily Macrotermitinae (in this study, mostly
colonies of Pseudocanthotermes sp.) at their foraging sites. The evolutionary arms race between termites and
ants led to various defensive mechanisms in termites (for example, a caste specialized in fighting predators). Because
M. analis incurs high injury/mortality risks when preying on termites, some risk-mitigating adaptations seem likely
to have evolved. We show that a unique rescue behavior in M. analis, consisting of injured nestmates being
carried back to the nest, reduces combat mortality. After a fight, injured ants are carried back by their nestmates;
these ants have usually lost an extremity or have termites clinging to them and are able to recover within the nest.
Injured ants that are forced experimentally to return without help, die in 32% of the cases. Behavioral experiments
show that two compounds, dimethyl disulfide and dimethyl trisulfide, present in the mandibular gland reservoirs,
trigger the rescue behavior. A model accounting for this rescue behavior identifies the drivers favoring its evolution
and estimates that rescuing enables maintenance of a 28.7% larger colony size. Our results are the first to
explore experimentally the adaptive value of this form of rescue behavior focused on injured nestmates in social
insects and help us to identify evolutionary drivers responsible for this type of behavior to evolve in animals.},

  abstract      = {Open wounds are a major health risk in animals, with species prone to injuries likely developing means to reduce these risks. We therefore analysed the behavioural response towards open wounds on the social and individual level in the termite group-hunting ant Megaponera analis. During termite raids, some ants get injured by termite soldiers (biting off extremities), after the fight injured ants get carried back to the nest by nest-mates. We observed treatment of the injury by nest-mates inside the nest through intense allogrooming at the wound. Lack of treatment increased mortality from 10% to 80% within 24 h, most likely due to infections. Wound clotting occurred extraordinarily fast in untreated injured individuals, within 10 min. Furthermore, heavily injured ants (loss of five extremities) were not rescued or treated; this was regulated not by the helper but by the unresponsiveness of the injured ant. Interestingly, lightly injured ants behaved ‘more injured’ near nest-mates. We show organized social wound treatment in insects through a multifaceted help system focused on injured individuals. This was not only limited to selective rescuing of lightly injured individuals by carrying them back (thus reducing predation risk), but, moreover, included a differentiated treatment inside the nest.},

For instance, we might expect evolutionary change in adaptive radiations to be driven by the availability of ecological niches. Such evolution has been shown to produce patterns of change that are different from those modelled by the Brownian process. We applied two tests for the assumption of Brownian motion that generally have high power to reject data generated under non-Brownian niche-filling models for the evolution of traits in adaptive radiations. As a case study, we used these tests to explore the evolution of feeding adaptations in two radiations of warblers. In one case, the patterns revealed do not accord with Brownian motion but show characteristics expected under certain niche-filling models.},

We examine adaptations of a microbial parasite in its natural environment: the body of its coevolved and manipulated host. Electron microscopy and 3D reconstructions of host and parasite tissues reveal that this fungus invades muscle fibers throughout the ant{\textquoteright}s body but leaves the brain intact, and that the fungal cells connect to form extensive networks. The connections are likened to structures that aid in transporting nutrients and organelles in several plant-associated fungi. These findings alter the current view of parasite-extended phenotypes by demonstrating that behavior control does not require the parasite to physically invade the host brain and that parasite cells may coordinate to change host behavior.Some microbes possess the ability to adaptively manipulate host behavior. To better understand how such microbial parasites control animal behavior, we examine the cell-level interactions between the species-specific fungal parasite Ophiocordyceps unilateralis sensu lato and its carpenter ant host (Camponotus castaneus) at a crucial moment in the parasite{\textquoteright}s lifecycle: when the manipulated host fixes itself permanently to a substrate by its mandibles. The fungus is known to secrete tissue-specific metabolites and cause changes in host gene expression as well as atrophy in the mandible muscles of its ant host, but it is unknown how the fungus coordinates these effects to manipulate its host{\textquoteright}s behavior. In this study, we combine techniques in serial block-face scanning-electron microscopy and deep-learning{\textendash}based image segmentation algorithms to visualize the distribution, abundance, and interactions of this fungus inside the body of its manipulated host. Fungal cells were found throughout the host body but not in the brain, implying that behavioral control of the animal body by this microbe occurs peripherally. Additionally, fungal cells invaded host muscle fibers and joined together to form networks that encircled the muscles. These networks may represent a collective foraging behavior of this parasite, which may in turn facilitate host manipulation.},

One hypothesis is that the arrangement of amino acid/codon assignments results from selection to minimize the effects of errors (e.g., mistranslation and mutation) on resulting proteins. If amino acid similarity is measured as polarity, the canonical code does indeed outperform most theoretical alternatives. However, this finding does not hold for other amino acid properties, ignores plausible restrictions on possible code structure, and does not address the naturally occurring nonstandard genetic codes. Finally, other analyses have shown that significantly better code structures are possible. Here, we show that if theoretically possible code structures are limited to reflect plausible biological constraints, and amino acid similarity is quantified using empirical data of substitution frequencies, the canonical code is at or very close to a global optimum for error minimization across plausible parameter space. This result is robust to variation in the methods and assumptions of the analysis. Although significantly better codes do exist under some assumptions, they are extremely rare and thus consistent with reports of an adaptive code: previous analyses which suggest otherwise derive from a misleading metric. However, all extant, naturally occurring, secondarily derived, nonstandard genetic codes do appear less adaptive. The arrangement of amino acid assignments to the codons of the standard genetic code appears to be a direct product of natural selection for a system that minimizes the phenotypic impact of genetic error. Potential criticisms of previous analyses appear to be without substance. That known variants of the standard genetic code appear less adaptive suggests that different evolutionary factors predominated before and after fixation of the canonical code. While the evidence for an adaptive code is clear, the process by which the code achieved this optimization requires further attention. },

  abstract      = {This dissertation attempts to deepen our understanding of teachersâ work and professionality, which involves not only their reasoning about what to teach and how to teach it, but also of what it is that makes education possible. This is accomplished by exploring a highly influential, if underestimated and under-researched, dimension of teacher practice and professionality: the relational dimension, involving the establishment and maintenance of educational relationships with and among students. In the imperatives and challenges of the 21st century the importance of highlighting the relational dimension seems to be a concern of increasing importance. Through interviews and observation that have generated the empirical material, the relational practices of eleven teachers are analyzed in accordance with a particular methodological scheme. Apart from providing a descriptive mapping of these practices, this study presents the practical arguments given by informants to substantiate their use. The numerous examples of relational practices and practical arguments that are herein provided serve to empirically confirm the pervasive relational character of a teacherâs work. What emerges is an understanding of an educational relationship, established and maintained by practices that seek genuine human contact with students, and that views relational attributes such as trust, social justice, benevolence, empathy and openness to the other as being of vital importance to the entirety of the educational process. In addition, the practices involving enacting educational communities among students, are shown to have significance for the educational process. What emerges as well is a conception of relational professionality as something that can be learned, meaning that teachers are made, not born. Moreover, âbeing professionalâ is here conceived, in pedagogical rather than sociological terms, as something that involves the quality of a teacherâs actions rather than the fact that s/he belongs to a particular profession. The findings of this study strongly suggest that relationships in schools often require conscious attention, rigorous work and delicate negotiations on the part of teachers in order to be (or become) educational. The process of education is sustained by an array of subtle relational conditions. The attempt of the teacher to deal with these conditions requires specific professional experience, understandings and practices.},

Serum hormones were compared within and between two groups of healthy young male volunteers participating in the 8-wk US Army Ranger course, with four repeated cycles of restricted energy intakes and refeeding: group 1 (n = 49) and group 2 (n = 48); energy deficits averaged 1,200 and 1,000 kcal/day, respectively. After 8 wk, most of group 1 achieved a minimum body fat, serum 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) was below normal (78 {+/-} 20 ng/dl), testosterone (T) approached castrate levels (4.5 {+/-} 3.9 nmol/l), insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) declined by one-half (75 {+/-} 25 {micro}g/l), and cholesterol rose from 158 {+/-} 31 to 217 {+/-} 39 mg/dl. Bioavailable T3 and T were further reduced by increases in their specific binding proteins in response to declining insulin. Refeeding, even with continuation of the other stressors, produced prompt recovery of T3, T, and IGF-I. Higher energy intakes in group 2 attenuated the subclinical hypothyroidism and hypercholesterolemia, whereas consistent luteinizing hormone suppression indicated centrally mediated threshold effects on gonadal hormone suppression. We conclude that low T, T3, and IGF-I remained reliable markers of acute energy deficits in the presence of other stressors; elevated cholesterol and cortisol provided information about chronic status, corresponding to diminishing body fat stores.},

The biological and social factors created a complex web, predisposing the child to primary, secondary and/or comorbidity problems, and leading to an inter- active process reducing the child's psychosocial capacity and compe- tence.

  abstract      = {Although its true function remains unclear, sleep is considered critical to human physiological and cognitive function. Equally, since sleep loss is a common occurrence prior to competition in athletes, this could significantly impact upon their athletic performance. Much of the previous research has reported that exercise performance is negatively affected following sleep loss; however, conflicting findings mean that the extent, influence, and mechanisms of sleep loss affecting exercise performance remain uncertain. For instance, research indicates some maximal physical efforts and gross motor performances can be maintained. In comparison, the few published studies investigating the effect of sleep loss on performance in athletes report a reduction in sport-specific performance. The effects of sleep loss on physiological responses to exercise also remain equivocal; however, it appears a reduction in sleep quality and quantity could result in an autonomic nervous system imbalance, simulating symptoms of the overtraining syndrome. Additionally, increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines following sleep loss could promote immune system dysfunction. Of further concern, numerous studies investigating the effects of sleep loss on cognitive function report slower and less accurate cognitive performance. Based on this context, this review aims to evaluate the importance and prevalence of sleep in athletes and summarises the effects of sleep loss (restriction and deprivation) on exercise performance, and physiological and cognitive responses to exercise. Given the equivocal understanding of sleep and athletic performance outcomes, further research and consideration is required to obtain a greater knowledge of the interaction between sleep and performance.},

Fumagalli et al. have found signs of selection for genetic variants in fat metabolism, not just for promoting heat-producing brown fat cells but also for coping with the large amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids found in their seafood diet (see the Perspective by Tishkoff). Genes under selection in these populations have a strong effect on height and weight of up to 2 cm and 4 kg, respectively, as well as a protective effect on cholesterol and triglyceride levels.Science, this issue p. 1343; see also p. 1282The indigenous people of Greenland, the Inuit, have lived for a long time in the extreme conditions of the Arctic, including low annual temperatures, and with a specialized diet rich in protein and fatty acids, particularly omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). A scan of Inuit genomes for signatures of adaptation revealed signals at several loci, with the strongest signal located in a cluster of fatty acid desaturases that determine PUFA levels. The selected alleles are associated with multiple metabolic and anthropometric phenotypes and have large effect sizes for weight and height, with the effect on height replicated in Europeans. By analyzing membrane lipids, we found that the selected alleles modulate fatty acid composition, which may affect the regulation of growth hormones. Thus, the Inuit have genetic and physiological adaptations to a diet rich in PUFAs.},

  abstract      = {To what degree is the divergent adaptation responsible for life's phenotypic variety also responsible for generating the millions of species that manifest this variation? Theory predicts that ecological divergence among populations should promote reproductive isolation, and recent empirical studies provide support for this hypothesis in a limited number of specific taxa. However, the essential question of whether ecology plays a truly general role in speciation has yet to be systematically evaluated. Here we address this integral issue using an approach that adds an ecological dimension to comparative studies investigating the relationship between reproductive isolation and divergence time. Specifically, we quantify ecological divergence for >500 species pairs from eight plant, invertebrate, and vertebrate taxa and statistically isolate its association with reproductive isolation. This approach demonstrates a highly consistent and significant positive association between ecological divergence and reproductive isolation across taxa. This relationship was also observed across different aspects of ecological divergence and components of reproductive isolation. These findings are highly consistent with the hypothesis that ecological adaptation plays a fundamental and taxonomically general role in promoting reproductive isolation and speciation. },

The prevailing hypothesis is that the selective rise of CCR5-<delta>32 to its current frequency can be attributed to bubonic plague.

This species contains three main groups of toxins: amatoxins, phallotoxins, and virotoxins. From these, amatoxins, especially α-amanitin, are the main responsible for the toxic effects in humans. It is recognized that α-amanitin inhibits RNA polymerase II, causing protein deficit and ultimately cell death, although other mechanisms are thought to be involved. The liver is the main target organ of toxicity, but other organs are also affected, especially the kidneys. Intoxication symptoms usually appear after a latent period and may include gastrointestinal disorders followed by jaundice, seizures, and coma, culminating in death. Therapy consists in supportive measures, gastric decontamination, drug therapy and, ultimately, liver transplantation if clinical condition worsens. The discovery of an effective antidote is still a major unsolved issue. The present paper examines the clinical toxicology of A. phalloides, providing the currently available information on the mechanisms of toxicityinvolved and on the current knowledge on the treatment prescribed against this type of mushrooms. Antidotal perspectives will be raised as to set the pace to new and improved therapy against these mushrooms.},

Silymarin. Silybum marianum (‘milk thistle’) is cur-
rently the most widely researched plant used in the treatment of
liver diseases. The active constituents of milk thistle are flavono-
lignans including silybin, silydianin, and silychristine, collectively
known as silymarin. Silybin is the component with the highest an-
tioxidant activity, and ‘milk thistle’ extracts are usually standard-
ized to contain 70–80% silybin (Luper, 1998). Due to its antioxidant
activity, silybin has been applied in the management of amatoxin
poisoning and evidence on the effectiveness of silybin in poisoned
patients has been reported. Forty-six cases of amatoxin poisoning
treated with silybin as monotherapy showed that all patients sur-
vived (Table 3) (Enjalbert et al., 2002). These results indicate that
silybin has some effectiveness in the management of amatoxin poi-
soning, exhibiting low mortality rates (Table 3).Silybin seems to
be more effective as monotherapy than when combined with ben-
zylpenicillin. In fact, in a recent study based on 1500 documented
cases, it was concluded that the overall mortality in intoxicated
patients with A. phalloides treated with silybin, as Legalon® SIL
(silibinin-C-2  ,3-dihydrogen succinate, disodium salt), is less than
10% in comparison to more than 20% when using benzylpenicillin

Cutting is energetically costly, so the amount of cutting is important in understanding foraging energetics. Estimates of the cutting density, metres of cutting per square metre of leaf, were made from samples of transported leaf cuttings and of fungal substrate from field colonies of Atta cephalotes and Atta colombica. To investigate cutting inside the nest, we made leaf-processing observations of our laboratory colony, A. cephalotes. We did not observe the commonly reported reduction of the leaf fragments into a pulp, which would greatly increase the energy cost of processing. Video clips of processing behaviours, including behaviours that have not previously been described, are linked. An estimated 2.9 ({\textpm}0.3) km of cutting with mandibles was required to reduce a square metre of leaf to fungal substrate. Only about 12\% ({\textpm}1\%) of this cutting took place outside of the nest. The cutting density and energy cost is lower for leaf material with higher ratios of perimeter to area, so we tested for, and found that the laboratory ants had a preference for leaves that were pre-cut into smaller pieces. Estimates suggest that the energy required to transport and cut up the leaf material is comparable to the metabolic energy available from the fungus grown on the leaves, and so conservation of energy is likely to be a particularly strong selective pressure for leafcutter ants.},

Through the analysis of mammal size distributions, we find the aquatic realm imposes stronger constraints on body size than does the terrestrial realm, driving and confining aquatic mammals to larger sizes. Calculations of energy intake and demand as a function of body size indicate heat loss imposes a strong lower bound on size, whereas the scaling of feeding rate versus metabolic rate imposes a constraint on maximum size. Rather than freeing animals from body size constraints, living in water appears to impose stronger selective pressures than does living on land.Four extant lineages of mammals have invaded and diversified in the water: Sirenia, Cetacea, Pinnipedia, and Lutrinae. Most of these aquatic clades are larger bodied, on average, than their closest land-dwelling relatives, but the extent to which potential ecological, biomechanical, and physiological controls contributed to this pattern remains untested quantitatively. Here, we use previously published data on the body masses of 3,859 living and 2,999 fossil mammal species to examine the evolutionary trajectories of body size in aquatic mammals through both comparative phylogenetic analysis and examination of the fossil record. Both methods indicate that the evolution of an aquatic lifestyle is driving three of the four extant aquatic mammal clades toward a size attractor at \~{}500 kg. The existence of this body size attractor and the relatively rapid selection toward, and limited deviation from, this attractor rule out most hypothesized drivers of size increase. These three independent body size increases and a shared aquatic optimum size are consistent with control by differences in the scaling of energetic intake and cost functions with body size between the terrestrial and aquatic realms. Under this energetic model, thermoregulatory costs constrain minimum size, whereas limitations on feeding efficiency constrain maximum size. The optimum size occurs at an intermediate value where thermoregulatory costs are low but feeding efficiency remains high. Rather than being released from size pressures, water-dwelling mammals are driven and confined to larger body sizes by the strict energetic demands of the aquatic medium.},

  abstract      = {Objective Although the serotonin precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) is marketed as a psychoactive nutritional supplement, knowledge is limited regarding the effects of exogenous 5-HTP on brain activity. This study examined if oral administration of 5-HTP to healthy adults impacted: (1) mood states, as measured by the Profile of Mood States (POMS); and (2) performance on the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), a measure sensitive to alterations in frontocortical serotonin levels. Methods A sample of 46 undergraduates participated, and each received either two 50 mg 5-HTP capsules or placebos, and completed the IGT and POMS following an absorption period. Results 5-HTP did not significantly alter mood states, but did impair performance on the IGT. Specifically, the 5-HTP group performed more poorly than the placebo group during the first 20 trials of the IGT but did not differ from the placebo group on trials 21–100. This suggests that oral 5-HTP specifically impaired decision making under ambiguity but not under risk. Males also performed more poorly on the first 20 trials of the IGT, regardless of treatment group. Conclusions Oral 5-HTP is psychoactive at low doses. Decisions made under ambiguity may be differentially sensitive to increased serotonin release or associated reductions in frontocortical dopamine activity. Copyright # 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Water-borne protozoan parasites that are specifically of concern are Giardia and Cryptosporidium because of their resistance to halogen disinfection. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of iodine tablets against Giardia and Cryptosporidium under general- and worst-case water conditions that might be found in the field. Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium oocysts were exposed to iodine according to manufacturer's instructions (two tablets/L = 13–18 mg/L for 20 minutes). This dose inactivated 3-log10 of Giardia in general-case water and pH 9. In worst-case water, however, only about 35% of cysts were inactivated at pH 5. Fifty minutes were required to achieve a 3-log10 reduction at pH 5. Cryptosporidium oocysts were more difficult to inactivate. Only 10% were inactivated after a 20-minute exposure to iodine according to manufacturer's instructions; even after 240 minutes of exposure to iodine only 66–81% oocysts were inactivated. These data strongly suggest that iodine disinfection is not effective in inactivating Cryptosporidium oocysts in water. Because this organism is common in all surface waters, it is recommended that another method of treatment be used before ingestion.

The importance and effectiveness of shivering heat production in the attenuation and reversal of hypothermia is described. Immediately following removal from cold stress, the patient is in danger of a deteriorating condition that may be due to collapse of arterial pressure and/or continued decrease of core temperature. Several controversies are discussed. It is advised that, when possible, patients should be actively but gently warmed as soon as possible (especially if arrival at the emergency department will take greater than 45 min). Extra time should be taken to check for life signs before cardiopulmonary resus-citation is initiated. Chest compressions should proceed at regular normothermic rates and care should be taken to not overventilate the patient. In the emergency department, several factors should be considered before deciding on a treatment regimen. These factors include level of consciousness, cardiovascular stability, core temperature and the direction of change of core temperature. It may be advantageous to transport the more severely hypothermic patient to a more advanced care facility even though transport time may be greater. See Commentary, page 5. },

Sammanfattning
Botulinustoxiner {\"{a}}r de mest potenta gifter man identifierat. De genereras av den anaeroba bakterien Clostridium botulinum. Toxinerna kan orsaka allvarlig f{\"{o}}rgiftning, ben{\"{a}}mnd botulism. Flera varianter finns av toxinet, betecknade A-G. Typ E {\"{a}}r vanligast i Sverige. Bakterien kan utvecklas i konserverad, r{\"{o}}kt eller j{\"{a}}st f{\"{o}}da som kontaminerats med sporer. Bakterierna avger ett v{\"{a}}rmelabilt toxin (protein) med neurotoxiska egenskaper. F{\"{o}}rgiftningen {\"{a}}r ovanlig i Sverige. 

Botulinustoxin destruerar de proteiner som svarar f{\"{o}}r fris{\"{a}}ttningen av acetylkolin vid perifera kolinerga synapser. D{\"{a}}rigenom blockeras den neuronala impulstransmissionen varvid muskelparalys gradvis uppst{\r{a}}r. 

Det finns flera varianter av botulism: f{\"{o}}do{\"{a}}mnesrelaterad botulism, sp{\"{a}}dbarnsbotulism, s{\r{a}}rbotulism, inhalationsbotulism och iatrogen botulism - den senare genom injektion av f{\"{o}}r stor eller upprepad dos toxin i terapeutiskt syfte.

Differentialdiagnoser {\"{a}}r exempelvis Guillan-Barrés syndrom, myastenia gravis och ALS. 

F{\"{o}}do{\"{a}}mnesrelaterad botulism {\"{a}}r den vanligaste formen av botulism och endast denna variant ber{\"{o}}rs i detta dokument.

Symtom / fynd
Symtomen utvecklas gradvis, vanligtvis 12-18-36 timmar efter f{\"{o}}rt{\"{a}}ring av kontaminerad f{\"{o}}da; i lindriga fall {\"{a}}ven senare. Tidig symtomdebut indikerar mer allvarligt f{\"{o}}rlopp. 

Initiala symtom kan vara yrsel, dimsyn, dubbelseende, ptos, mydriasis, oftalmoplegi, torrhet i munnen, sv{\"{a}}ljsv{\r{a}}righeter, sluddrigt tal, dyspné, urinretention, uppsv{\"{a}}lld buk och obstipation. Ortostatism och svimningstendens f{\"{o}}rekommer. Sensorisk p{\r{a}}verkan saknas.

Ca 6-8 timmar efter symtomdebut tillkommer i sv{\r{a}}ra fall en mer allvarlig symtomatologi - progredierande, symmetrisk och ned{\r{a}}tstigande slapp muskelparalys som kan leda till pl{\"{o}}tsligt sviktande andning. Behovet av andningsunderst{\"{o}}d varierar kraftigt mellan de olika typerna av toxin. Den genomsnittliga tiden f{\"{o}}r respiratorbehandling {\"{a}}r ca 2 m{\r{a}}nader f{\"{o}}r Typ A toxin medan den f{\"{o}}r Typ E toxin {\"{a}}r ca 4 dygn. 

Dimsyn, dyspné och tr{\"{o}}tthet kan kvarst{\r{a}} under l{\r{a}}ng tid (m{\r{a}}nader / {\r{a}}r). Oliguri, infektioner, serumsjuka och anafylaxi {\"{a}}r andra sekund{\"{a}}ra komplikationer.

{\"{O}}vervakning / behandling
Symtom tydande p{\r{a}} botulism ska f{\"{o}}ranleda observation och kontinuerlig bed{\"{o}}mning p{\r{a}} sjukhus med intensivv{\r{a}}rdsresurser.

F{\"{o}}lj kontinuerligt syrs{\"{a}}ttning och andningsm{\"{o}}nster.

S{\"{a}}kra fri luftv{\"{a}}g och adekvat ventilation.

Vid sviktande andning {\r{a}}terspeglad genom sjunkande PEF-v{\"{a}}rden ska respiratorbehandling startas (blodgaserna ger otillr{\"{a}}cklig ledning). Kontrollerad andning i respirator b{\"{o}}r allts{\r{a}} p{\r{a}}b{\"{o}}rjas innan blodgaserna f{\"{o}}rs{\"{a}}mras. Trakeotomi blir ofta aktuell pga det l{\r{a}}ngdragna f{\"{o}}rloppet. 

KAD kan beh{\"{o}}vas pga urinretention.

Immunserum (antitoxin) ska ges snarast m{\"{o}}jligt. Dock {\"{a}}r tillg{\"{a}}ngligheten varierande fr{\r{a}}n tid till annan, RING GIC f{\"{o}}r information. Antitoxinet bromsar upp f{\"{o}}rgiftningens progress men reverserar inte uppkomna symtom. Dock f{\"{o}}rkortas f{\"{o}}rloppet signifikant om antitoxin ges.

Previous studies suggested that the proportion of pseudogenes in the OR gene family is significantly larger in humans than in other apes and significantly larger in apes than in the mouse. To investigate the process of degeneration of the olfactory repertoire in primates, we estimated the proportion of OR pseudogenes in 19 primate species by surveying randomly chosen subsets of 100 OR genes from each species. We find that apes, Old World monkeys and one New World monkey, the howler monkey, have a significantly higher proportion of OR pseudogenes than do other New World monkeys or the lemur (a prosimian). Strikingly, the howler monkey is also the only New World monkey to possess full trichromatic vision, along with Old World monkeys and apes. Our findings suggest that the deterioration of the olfactory repertoire occurred concomitant with the acquisition of full trichromatic color vision in primates.},

To assess whether prostate cancer might be related to hormone levels and, by inference, to differences in sexual activity.

PATIENTS, SUBJECTS AND METHODS
In a case-control study of men with prostate cancer aged < 70Â years at diagnosis and age-matched control subjects, information was collected on two aspects of sexual activity; the number of sexual partners and the frequency of total ejaculations during the third to fifth decades of life.

RESULTS
There was no association of prostate cancer with the number of sexual partners or with the maximum number of ejaculations in 24Â h. There was a negative trend (PÂ <Â 0.01) for the association between risk and number of ejaculations in the third decade, independent of those in the fourth or fifth. Men who averaged five or more ejaculations weekly in their 20s had an odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of 0.66 (0.49â0.87) compared with those who ejaculated less often.

CONCLUSIONS
The null association with the number of sexual partners argues against infection as a cause of prostate cancer in this population. Ejaculatory frequency, especially in early adult life, is negatively associated with the risk of prostate cancer, and thus the molecular biological consequences of suppressed or diminished ejaculation are worthy of further research.},

Because of their abundance, certain benthic suspension feeders have been shown to have a major impact in marine ecosystems. They capture large quantities of particles and might directly regulate primary production and indirectly regulate secondary production in littoral food chains. Suspension feeders develop dense, three-dimensional communities whose structural complexity depends on flow speed. It has been postulated that these communities can self-organize to enhance food capture and thus establish boundary systems capable of successfully exploiting a less structured system, namely, the plankton.},

A content analyses showed that young girls experienced verbal, nonverbal, and sexual assault behaviors at school. Sexual harassment as a concealed phenomenon and manifest within a romantic discourse were themes found in the analysis. A conclusion is that schools have to acknowledge behaviors related to sexual harassment as a potential problem even in young ages and develop methods to approach the subject also for this age group.},

In order to prevent the re-enactment and perpetuation of this problem, it is important to explore processes that contribute to its existence. A high school sexual harassment lawsuit in Sweden is used as a case study to illustrate ways that might explain how sexual harassment is normalised at the organisational level. A thematic analysis has been used to identify themes and subthemes. The results show a multi-layered web of factors and practices related to sexual harassment at the organisational level in the school. In order to change a school’s culture from one where sexual harassment is normalised, multiple needs must be addressed: organisational weaknesses must be strengthened; adults enact their responsibility to change the situation; and awareness of the relationship between sexual harassment, gender, and power needs to be increased. },

We presented game and random chessboards in both a copy and a recall task. In a within-subject design, the stimuli were displayed using two presentation media: (a) physical board and pieces, as in Chase and Simon's (1973) study; and (b) a computer display, as in Gobet and Simon's (1998) study. Results show that, in most cases, no more than three chunks were replaced in the recall task, as predicted by template theory. In addition, with game positions in the computer condition, chess Masters replaced very large chunks (up to 15 pieces), again in line with template theory. Overall, the results suggest that the original chunking theory overestimated short-term memory capacity and underestimated the size of chunks used, in particular with Masters. They also suggest that Cowan's (2001) proposal that STM holds four chunks may be an overestimate. },

The template theory presented by Gobet and Simon based on the EPAM theory offers precise predictions on cognitive processes during the presentation and recall of chess positions. This article describes the behavior of CHREST, a computer implementation of the template theory, in a memory task when the presentation time is varied from one second to sixty, on the recall of game and random positions, and compares the model to human data. Strong players are better than weak players in both types of positions, especially with long presentation times, but even after brief presentations. CHREST predicts the data, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Strong playersâ superiority with random positions is explained by the large number of chunks they hold in LTM. Their excellent recall with short presentation times is explained by templates, a special class of chunks. CHREST is compared to other theories of chess skill, which either cannot account for the superiority of Masters in random positions or predict too strong a performance of Masters in such positions.},

intermittent severe cold exposure and to assess the effect of exercise on any
adaptation obtained.
2. Sixteen subjects were divided into two equal groups. Each subject performed
ten head-out immersions; two into thermoneutral water which was then cooled until
they shivered vigorously, and eight into water at 15 'C for 40 min. During the
majority of the 15 'C immersions, one group (dynamic group) exercised whilst the
other (static group) rested.
3. Results showed that both groups responded to repeated cold immersions with
a reduction in their initial responses to cold. The time course of these reductions
varied, however, between responses.
4. Only the static group developed a reduced metabolic response to prolonged
resting immersion.
5. It is concluded that repeated resting exposure to cold was the more effective
way of producing an adaptation. The performance of exercise during repeated
exposure to cold prevented the development of an adaptive reduction in the
metabolic response to cold during a subsequent resting immersion. In addition, many
of the adaptations obtained during repeated resting exposure were overridden or
masked during a subsequent exercising immersion.},

It has tripled in size from Australopithecines to modern humans 1 and has become almost six times larger than expected for a placental mammal of human size 2 . Brains incur high metabolic costs 3 and accordingly a long-standing question is why the large human brain has evolved 4 . The leading hypotheses propose benefits of improved cognition for overcoming ecological5â7, social8â10 or cultural11â14 challenges. However, these hypotheses are typically assessed using correlative analyses, and establishing causes for brain-size evolution remains difficult15,16. Here we introduce a metabolic approach that enables causal assessment of social hypotheses for brain-size evolution. Our approach yields quantitative predictions for brain and body size from formalized social hypotheses given empirical estimates of the metabolic costs of the brain. Our model predicts the evolution of adult Homo sapiens-sized brains and bodies when individuals face a combination of 60% ecological, 30% cooperative and 10% between-group competitive challenges, and suggests that between-individual competition has been unimportant for driving human brain-size evolution. Moreover, our model indicates that brain expansion in Homo was driven by ecological rather than social challenges, and was perhaps strongly promoted by culture. Our metabolic approach thus enables causal assessments that refine, refute and unify hypotheses of brain-size evolution.},

  abstract      = {SummaryBackground Resistance to antibiotics is a major public-health problem and antibiotic use is being increasingly recognised as the main selective pressure driving this resistance. Our aim was to assess outpatient use of antibiotics and the association with resistance. Methods We investigated outpatient antibiotic use in 26 countries in Europe that provided internationally comparable distribution or reimbursement data, between Jan 1, 1997, and Dec 31, 2002, by calculating the number of defined daily doses (DDD) per 1000 inhabitants per day, according to \{WHO\} anatomic therapeutic chemical classification and \{DDD\} measurement methodology. We assessed the ecological association between antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance rates using Spearman's correlation coefficients. Findings Prescription of antibiotics in primary care in Europe varied greatly; the highest rate was in France (32Â·2 \{DDD\} per 1000 inhabitants daily) and the lowest was in the Netherlands (10Â·0 \{DDD\} per 1000 inhabitants daily). We noted a shift from the old narrow-spectrum antibiotics to the new broad-spectrum antibiotics. We also recorded striking seasonal fluctuations with heightened winter peaks in countries with high yearly use of antibiotics. We showed higher rates of antibiotic resistance in high consuming countries, probably related to the higher consumption in southern and eastern Europe than in northern Europe. Interpretation These data might provide a useful method for assessing public-health strategies that aim to reduce antibiotic use and resistance levels. },

This review critically appraises the existing knowledge on the chemistry of the functionally important constituents, the processing of the spice into wholes, powder, and oleoresins, and the objective methods and standards available for evaluation of quality. The importance of the mild (but persistent) aroma, and the lack of detailed knowledge on the significant volatiles are discussed. Some unpublished data on significant aroma components, a tristimulus study of color, and subjective evaluations of quality are summarized. Other areas briefly discussed are the production and trade, curry powder, allied spices, and biosynthetic and physiological aspects. The confusion existing in the literature on the nomenclature of species included in the genus Curcuma is pointed out. In view of the growing importance of turmeric and its extracts as a natural food color, recent results on toxicological aspects are discussed. The areas in which research is needed are indicated at the end.},

In semistarvation the diet consisted of carbohydrate plus a daily supplement of 4.5 gm NaCl and vitamins.

Physical activity, including treadmill walking costing about 1200 Calories daily during control, was constant throughout. ‘Cells’ was computed as gross weight less fat, extracellular fluid and bone mineral. The gross BMR decreased in all the subjects during semistarvation, the average decline being 17.1% after 19 days (54) and 21.4% after 13 days (55). The BMR was also decreased when computed per unit of gross weight, per unit of body surface, per unit of gross body weight to the 0.73 power and per unit of ‘cells.’ The average percentage decline being, respectively, 8.7, 13.4, 9.8 and 11.8 for experiment 54 and 14.2, 18.4, 15.9 and 16.6 for experiment 55. All P values for the differences are <0.001. After 1 week of refeeding the gross BMR returned precisely to the control value in each group and remained at that level until the end of the observations.

The use of neuropsychological assessment tools in assessing potential effects of dehydration is a natural progression of the scientific pursuit to understand the physical and mental ramifications of dehydration. It has long been known that dehydration negatively affects physical performance. Examining the effects of hydration status on cognitive function is a relatively new area of research, resulting in part from our increased understanding of hydration's impact on physical performance and advances in the discipline of cognitive neuropsychology. The available research in this area, albeit sparse, indicates that decrements in physical, visuomotor, psychomotor, and cognitive performance can occur when 2\% or more of body weight is lost due to water restriction, heat, and/or physical exertion. Additional research is needed, especially studies designed to reduce, if not remove, the limitations of studies conducted to date.},

We found that these two elephants were polyphasic sleepers, had an average daily total sleep time of 2 h, mostly between 02:00 and 06:00, and displayed the shortest daily sleep time of any mammal recorded to date. Moreover, these two elephants exhibited both standing and recumbent sleep, but only exhibited recumbent sleep every third or fourth day, potentially limiting their ability to enter REM sleep on a daily basis. In addition, we observed on five occasions that the elephants went without sleep for up to 46 h and traversed around 30 km in 10 h, possibly due to disturbances such as potential predation or poaching events, or a bull elephant in musth. They exhibited no form of sleep rebound following a night without sleep. Environmental conditions, especially ambient air temperature and relative humidity, analysed as wet-bulb globe temperature, reliably predict sleep onset and offset times. The elephants selected novel sleep sites each night and the amount of activity between sleep periods did not affect the amount of sleep. A number of similarities and differences to studies of elephant sleep in captivity are noted, and specific factors shaping sleep architecture in elephants, on various temporal scales, are discussed.},

  abstract      = {Despite the growth of Open Access, illegally circumventing paywalls to access scholarly publications is becoming a more mainstream phenomenon. The web service Sci-Hub is amongst the biggest facilitators of this, offering free access to around 62 million publications. So far it is not well studied how and why its users are accessing publications through Sci-Hub. By utilizing the recently released corpus of Sci-Hub and comparing it to the data of ~28 million downloads done through the service, this study tries to address some of these questions. The comparative analysis shows that both the usage and complete corpus is largely made up of recently published articles, with users disproportionately favoring newer articles and 35\% of downloaded articles being published after 2013. These results hint that embargo periods before publications become Open Access are frequently circumnavigated using Guerilla Open Access approaches like Sci-Hub. On a journal level, the downloads show a bias towards some scholarly disciplines, especially Chemistry, suggesting increased barriers to access for these. Comparing the use and corpus on a publisher level, it becomes clear that only 11\% of publishers are highly requested in comparison to the baseline frequency, while 45\% of all publishers are significantly less accessed than expected. Despite this, the oligopoly of publishers is even more remarkable on the level of content consumption, with 80\% of all downloads being published through only 9 publishers. All of this suggests that Sci-Hub is used by different populations and for a number of different reasons and that there is still a lack of access to the published scientific record. A further analysis of these openly available data resources will undoubtedly be valuable for the investigation of academic publishing.},

  abstract      = {Mammalian spermatogenesis requires a stem cell pool, a period of amplification of cell numbers, the completion of reduction division to haploid cells (meiosis), and the morphological transformation of the haploid cells into spermatozoa (spermiogenesis). The net result of these processes is the production of massive numbers of spermatozoa over the reproductive lifetime of the animal. One study that utilized homogenization-resistant spermatids as the standard determined that human daily sperm production (dsp) was at 45 million per day per testis (). For each human that means â¼1,000 sperm are produced per second. A key to this level of gamete production is the organization and architecture of the mammalian testes that results in continuous sperm production. The seemingly complex repetitious relationship of cells termed the âcycle of the seminiferous epitheliumâ is driven by the continuous commitment of undifferentiated spermatogonia to meiosis and the period of time required to form spermatozoa. This commitment termed the A to A1 transition requires the action of retinoic acid (RA) on the undifferentiated spermatogonia or prospermatogonia. In stages VII to IX of the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium, Sertoli cells and germ cells are influenced by pulses of RA. These pulses of RA move along the seminiferous tubules coincident with the spermatogenic wave, presumably undergoing constant synthesis and degradation. The RA pulse then serves as a trigger to commit undifferentiated progenitor cells to the rigidly timed pathway into meiosis and spermatid differentiation.},

  abstract      = {Starch, protein, and lipid are three major sources of calories in the human diet. The unique and universal human practice of cooking has been demonstrated to increase the energy gained from foods rich in starch or protein. Yet no studies have tested whether cooking has equivalent effects on the energy gained from lipid-rich foods. Using mice as a model, we addressed this question by examining the impact of cooking on the energy gained from peanuts, a lipid-rich oilseed, and compared this impact against that of nonthermal processing (blending). We found that cooking consistently increased the energy gained per calorie, whereas blending had no detectable energetic benefits. Assessment of fecal fat excretion showed increases in lipid digestibility when peanuts were cooked, and examination of diet microstructure revealed concomitant alterations to the integrity of cell walls and the oleosin layer of proteins that otherwise shield lipids from digestive lipases. Both effects were consistent with the greater energy gain observed with cooking. Our findings highlight the importance of cooking in increasing dietary energy returns for humans, both past and present. Am J Phys Anthropol 156:11â18, 2015 Â© 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Many requirements for multicellular organization (cell adhesion, cell-cell communication and coordination, programmed cell death) likely evolved in ancestral unicellular organisms. However, the evolution of multicellular organisms from unicellular ancestors may be opposed by genetic conflicts that arise when mutant cell lineages promote their own increase at the expense of the integrity of the multicellular organism. Numerous defenses limit such genetic conflicts, perhaps the most important being development from a unicell, which minimizes conflicts from selection among cell lineages, and redistributes genetic variation arising within multicellular individuals between individuals. With a unicellular bottleneck, defecting cell lineages rarely succeed beyond the life span of the multicellular individual. When multicellularity arises through aggregation of scattered cells or when multicellular organisms fuse to form genetic chimeras, there are more opportunities for propagation of defector cell lineages. Intraorganismal competition may partly explain why multicellular organisms that develop by aggregation generally exhibit less differentiation than organisms that develop clonally. },

  abstract      = {Understanding the timing and character of the expansion of Homo sapiens out of Africa is critical for inferring the colonization and admixture processes that underpin global population history. It has been argued that dispersal out of Africa had an early phase, particularly ~130â90 thousand years ago (ka), that reached only the East Mediterranean Levant, and a later phase, ~60â50âka, that extended across the diverse environments of Eurasia to Sahul. However, recent findings from East Asia and Sahul challenge this model. Here we show that H. sapiens was in the Arabian Peninsula before 85âka. We describe the Al Wusta-1 (AW-1) intermediate phalanx from the site of Al Wusta in the Nefud desert, Saudi Arabia. AW-1 is the oldest directly dated fossil of our species outside Africa and the Levant. The palaeoenvironmental context of Al Wusta demonstrates that H. sapiens using Middle Palaeolithic stone tools dispersed into Arabia during a phase of increased precipitation driven by orbital forcing, in association with a primarily African fauna. A Bayesian model incorporating independent chronometric age estimates indicates a chronology for Al Wusta of ~95â86âka, which we correlate with a humid episode in the later part of Marine Isotope Stage 5 known from various regional records. Al Wusta shows that early dispersals were more spatially and temporally extensive than previously thought. Early H. sapiens dispersals out of Africa were not limited to winter rainfall-fed Levantine Mediterranean woodlands immediately adjacent to Africa, but extended deep into the semi-arid grasslands of Arabia, facilitated by periods of enhanced monsoonal rainfall.},

The exact timing of and relationships among these events are debated because of poor age constraints and contradictory stratigraphic correlations. Here, we show that the first Paleoproterozoic global glaciation and the onset of the GOE occurred between ca. 2,460 and 2,426 Ma, ∼100 My earlier than previously estimated, based on an age of 2,426 ± 3 Ma for Ongeluk Formation magmatism from the Kaapvaal Craton of southern Africa. This age helps define a key paleomagnetic pole that positions the Kaapvaal Craton at equatorial latitudes of 11° ± 6° at this time. Furthermore, the rise of atmospheric oxygen was not monotonic, but was instead characterized by oscillations, which together with climatic instabilities may have continued over the next ∼200 My until ≤2,250–2,240 Ma. Ongeluk Formation volcanism at ca. 2,426 Ma was part of a large igneous province (LIP) and represents a waning stage in the emplacement of several temporally discrete LIPs across a large low-latitude continental landmass. These LIPs played critical, albeit complex, roles in the rise of oxygen and in both initiating and terminating global glaciations. This series of events invites comparison with the Neoproterozoic oxygen increase and Sturtian Snowball Earth glaciation, which accompanied emplacement of LIPs across supercontinent Rodinia, also positioned at low latitude.},

Oxygen flooded Earth’s atmosphere earlier than thought
Volcanism and global glaciation coincided to the gas’s rise
BY THOMAS SUMNER 3:45PM, FEBRUARY 6, 2017
Banded iron
OXYGEN’S ORIGINS The rise of oxygen in Earth’s atmosphere and oceans, known as the Great Oxidation Event, began around 100 million years earlier than previously thought, new research suggests. The oxygen’s presence left a mark in the geologic record, such as this 2.1-billion-year-old banded iron formation.

The breath of oxygen that enabled the emergence of complex life kicked off around 100 million years earlier than previously thought, new dating suggests.

Previous studies pegged the first appearance of relatively abundant oxygen in Earth’s atmosphere, known as the Great Oxidation Event, or GOE, at a little over 2.3 billion years ago. New dating of ancient volcanic outpourings, however, suggests that oxygen levels began a wobbly upsurge between 2.460 billion and 2.426 billion years ago, researchers report the week of February 6 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

That time difference is a big deal, says study coauthor and sedimentary geologist Andrey Bekker of the University of California, Riverside. The new date shakes up scientists’ understanding of the environmental conditions that led to the GOE, which prompted the evolution of oxygen-dependent life-forms called eukaryotes. Voluminous volcanic eruptions at the time poured fresh rock over a supercontinent near the equator, and the planet dipped into a frigid period known as a Snowball Earth.

A similar series of geologic events around 700 million years ago coincided with a second rise of oxygen, to near-modern levels, and some eukaryotes evolving into the first animals. Both oxygen upswings pushed life toward complexity and the ultimate emergence of humans, Bekker says. “For the first time, we see parallels between these two time intervals,” he says.

Oxygen-producing microbes probably first appeared more than 3 billion years ago (SN Online: 9/8/15). But oxygen remained scant until the GOE when, for unknown reasons, atmospheric concentrations of the gas rose from near zero to around 0.1 percent of modern levels.

Dating the GOE’s start has been tricky, though, because few rocks from back then remain. Geologist Ashley Gumsley of Lund University in Sweden, Bekker and colleagues studied ancient volcanic rocks from South Africa that neighbor a layer of minerals that could have formed only in the presence of oxygen. Using an old technique, geologists had previously determined those volcanic rocks to be from around 2.222 billion years ago, well after the GOE’s start.

Applying modern techniques that measure the gradual decay of radioactive uranium in the rocks, the researchers revised the volcanism’s timing to about 2.426 billion years ago. That new date — plus a separate volcanic eruption previously dated to around 2.460 billion years ago that clearly happened before the oxygen rise — helps constrain the potential GOE start date.

The GOE isn’t the only global event to have its timeline tweaked. The oldest known evidence of global glaciation, called a Snowball Earth, lies underneath and alongside the South African rocks. The new eruption dating pushes that Snowball Earth event earlier as well — to around the same time as the start of the GOE.

The oxygen rise and the temperature drop may have been related, the researchers propose.

The new data and existing chemical evidence suggest that oxygen levels during the GOE wavered between pitiful and plentiful several times, rather than steadily rising (SN: 2/18/17, p.16). (Oxygen concentrations stabilized around 2.250 billion years ago and remained largely unchanged until levels rose again more than a billion years later.) These oscillations coincided with Snowball Earths and volcanic eruptions, Gumsley says.

Climate, oxygen and volcanism were intertwined during the GOE, the researchers propose. Volcanic eruptions covered the supercontinent with fresh rock. That rock formed near the equator where heavy precipitation weathered the rock, drawing carbon dioxide from the air and washing nutrients into the ocean. Those nutrients nourished photosynthetic microbes, which produced an abundance of oxygen. Oxygen built up in the atmosphere and reacted with methane, reducing levels of that greenhouse gas (SN: 10/29/16, p. 17).

With less CO2 and methane warming the climate, Earth froze and oxygen-producing biological activity decreased. The ongoing volcanism spewed replacement CO2 into the atmosphere over time and eventually reheated the planet.

“This is further evidence that oxygen’s history has really been a roller coaster ride rather than a unidirectional rise,” says Yale University geochemist Noah Planavsky. While he’s uncertain about the role rock weathering played in controlling ancient oxygen levels, Planavsky believes the new age will allow scientists to delve into the question of why the GOE began when it did. “Without dates,” he says, it’s impossible “to have any real grounding to tackle these problems.”},

The aim of the present study was to investigate the inflammatory environment and state of activation and mediator-producing potential of circulating leukocytes during prolonged physical activity with concomitant energy and sleep deprivation. Eight well-trained males were studied during 7Â days of semi-continuous physical activity. Sleep was restricted to about 1Â h/24Â h, energy intake to 1.5-- 3.0Â MJ/24Â h. Blood was drawn at 07.00 a.m. on days 0, 2, 4, and 7. Plasma levels of inflammation markers were measured. The response of circulating leukocytes to lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 1Â $\mu$gÂ mLâ1), and the effect of added hydrocortisone (10 and 100Â nmolÂ Lâ1), were measured in the supernatant after 3Â h of incubation in an ex vivo whole blood model. Activation of leukocytes steadily increased as measured by plasma matrix metalloproteinase-9, tumour necrosis factor-$\alpha$, interleukin-1$\beta$, and interleukin-6. Inhibitors of systemic inflammation were either unaltered (tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1) or elevated (plasma interleukin-1 receptor antagonist). Cortisol levels increased on days 2 and 4, but thereafter reverted to baseline values. The leukocytes responded to LPS activation with increasing release of inflammatory cytokines throughout the study period. The anti-inflammatory potency of hydrocortisone decreased. Prolonged multifactorial stress thus activated circulating immune cells and primed them for an increased response to a subsequent microbial challenge.},

In this communication, we investigated whether fetal exposure to some of these chemicals at doses consumed by people, has any long-term effect on the reproductive functions of the male offspring. Thus, time-pregnant CD-1 mice were fed diethylstilbestrol (DES), bisphenol A (BPA), and aroclor (aroclor 1016) at an average concentration of 100 ng/kg/day, 50 <B5>g/kg/day, and 50 <B5>g/kg/day, respectively, during Days 16?18 of gestation. A high dose of DES (200 <B5>g/kg/day) was also tested to compare the results of the current study with those of others using the high dose only. The offspring were examined at Day 3, Day 21, and Day 60 following birth. We demonstrated that BPA, aroclor, and the lower dose of DES enhanced anogenital distance, increased prostate size, and decreased epididymal weight. No effect was found on the testicular weight or size. The chemicals also permanently increased androgen receptor (AR) binding activity of the prostate at this dosage. This is the first demonstration that environmental chemicals program AR function permanently at the dosage consumed by the general population. The higher dosage of DES, on the other hand, produced an opposite effect, decreasing prostate weight, prostate AR binding, and anogenital distance, thus confirming the previous reports. To investigate whether the above mentioned effects of the chemicals represent direct or indirect effects, we also tested the effect of the chemicals on prostate development in vitro. Thus fetal urogenital sinus (UGS), isolated at the 17th day of gestation was cultured with the chemicals in the presence and absence of testosterone (10 ng/ml) for 6 days, and prostate growth was monitored by determining the size and branching of the specimen following histology. Results showed that these chemicals induced prostate growth in the presence and absence of testosterone. They also increased androgen-binding activity. Thus, the results of the in vivo studies were reproduced in the in vitro experiments, suggesting a direct effect of these chemicals on the development of fetal reproductive organs. This is the first demonstration that estrogenic chemicals induce reproductive malformation by direct interference with the fetal reproductive organs and not by interfering with the maternal or fetal endocrine system. The chemicals are able to induce malformation even in the absence of fetal testosterone; however, they are more effective in the presence of testosterone.},

  abstract      = {How did full meiotic eukaryotic sex evolve and what was the immediate advantage allowing it to develop? We propose that the crucial determinant can be found in internal reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation at the start of eukaryotic evolution approximately 2 Ã 109 years ago. The large amount of ROS coming from a bacterial endosymbiont gave rise to DNA damage and vast increases in host genome mutation rates. Eukaryogenesis and chromosome evolution represent adaptations to oxidative stress. The host, an archaeon, most probably already had repair mechanisms based on DNA pairing and recombination, and possibly some kind of primitive cell fusion mechanism. The detrimental effects of internal ROS formation on host genome integrity set the stage allowing evolution of meiotic sex from these humble beginnings. Basic meiotic mechanisms thus probably evolved in response to endogenous ROS production by the âpre-mitochondrionâ. This alternative to mitosis is crucial under novel, ROS-producing stress situations, like extensive motility or phagotrophy in heterotrophs and endosymbiontic photosynthesis in autotrophs. In multicellular eukaryotes with a germlineâsoma differentiation, meiotic sex with diploidâhaploid cycles improved efficient purging of deleterious mutations. Constant pressure of endogenous ROS explains the ubiquitous maintenance of meiotic sex in practically all eukaryotic kingdoms. Here, we discuss the relevant observations underpinning this model.},

  abstract      = {Treated or untreated surface water is one of the main sources of drinking water under field and
emergency conditions. The aims of the present thesis were to determine the prevalence of
enteropathogens in surface water in Finland, evaluate the purification capacities of water treatment
devices and the methods used for detection of enteropathogens and indicators to obtain data for
the assessment and management of microbial risks in drinking water production from surface
water. The present study will aid in developing practical plans to improve water safety, especially
under field conditions.
In all, 41.0% (57/139) of the surface water samples collected during 2000-2001 were positive for at
least one of the analysed pathogens: 17.3% positive for campylobacters, 13.7% for Giardia spp.,
10.1% for Cryptosporidium spp. and 9.4% for noroviruses (23.0% genogroup I and 77.0%
genogroup II). During the winter season, the samples were significantly (p < 0.05) less frequently
positive for enteropathogens than during other sampling seasons. No significant differences were
found in the prevalences of enteropathogens between rivers and lakes. The presence of
thermotolerant coliforms, Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens showed significant bivariate,
nonparametric, Spearman’s rank order correlation coefficients (p < 0.001), with a sample being
positive for one or more of the analysed enteropathogens. No significant correlations were
observed between counts or count levels of thermotolerant coliforms, E. coli or presence of F-RNA
phages and enteropathogens in the analysed samples. 

In general, the water treatment devices tested were able to remove bacterial contaminants by 3.6–
6.9 log10 units from contaminated raw water, while devices based only on filtration through pores
0.2–0.4 µm or larger failed in viral and chemical purification. Only one device, based on reverse
osmosis, was capable of removing F-RNA phages and botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) at
concentrations under the detection limit and microcystins by 2.5 log10 units. Simultaneous testing
for various enteropathogenic and indicator microbes was a useful and practical way to obtain data
on the purification capacity of commercial small-scale drinking water filters.
The m-Endo LES SFS 3016:2001 was the only method showing no statistical differences in E. coli
counts compared with the reference method LTTC ISO 9308-1:2000, whereas the Colilert 18 and
Readycult methods showed significantly higher counts for E. coli than the LTTC method. Based on
this evaluation study, the Colilert 18, Readycult and Water Check methods are all suitable for
coliform and E. coli detection both under field conditions and in routine use in the water industry.
The two rapid enzyme immunoassay tests intended for the detection of BoNT failed to detect BoNT
from aqueous samples containing an estimated concentration of BoNT of 396 000 ng/l.
We estimated the prevalence of Giardia infections in the asymptomatic (i.e. no gastroenteric
symptoms) general population in the Nordic countries to be 2.97% (95% CI: 2.64; 3.31) and in the
symptomatic population 5.81% (95% CI: 5.34; 6.30). For Cryptosporidium the prevalences were
0.99% (95% CI: 0.81; 1.19) and 2.91% (95% CI: 2.71; 3.12), respectively. The vast majority of
cases will remain unregistered in the national registers of infectious diseases, since for single
registered cases there will be 254-867 cases of Giardia remaining undetected/unregistered and
4072-15 181 cases of Cryptosporidium, respectively.},

A test was performed to evaluate the microbial and chemical purification capacity of nine portable, small-scale water purification filter devices with production capacity less than 100 L/h. The devices were tested for simultaneous removal capacity of bacteria (cultured Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae), enteric protozoans (formalin-stored Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts), viral markers (F-RNA bacteriophages) and microcystins produced by toxic cyanobacterial cultures. In general, the devices tested were able to remove bacterial contaminants by 3.6-6.9 log10 units from raw water. Those devices based only on filtration through pores 0.2-0.4 μm or larger failed in viral and chemical purification. Only one device, based on reverse osmosis, was capable of removing F-RNA phages at concentrations under the detection limit and microcystins by 2.5 log10. The present study emphasised the need for evaluation tests of water purification devices from the public safety and HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point) points of view. Simultaneous testing for various pathogenic/indicator microbes and microcystins was shown to be a useful and practical way to obtain essential data on actual purification capacity of commercial small-scale drinking-water filters.},

The subcortical pathway, which consists of superior colliculus, pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus, and amygdala, enables rapid and automatic face processing. A specific component of this pathway â i.e., the amygdala â has been shown to be abnormally activated in paradigms where individuals had to specifically attend to the eye-region; however, a direct examination of the effect of manipulating the gaze to the eye-regions on all the components of the subcortical system altogether has never been performed. The subcortical system is particularly important as it shapes the functional specialization of the face-processing cortex during development. Using functional MRI, we investigated the effect of constraining gaze in the eye-region during dynamic emotional face perception in groups of participants with ASD and typical controls. We computed differences in activation in the subcortical face processing system (superior colliculus, pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus and amygdala) for the same stimuli seen freely or with the gaze constrained in the eye-region. Our results show that when constrained to look in the eyes, individuals with ASD show abnormally high activation in the subcortical system, which may be at the basis of their eye avoidance in daily life.},

The present study investigated whether urine analysis can serve as a measure of dehydration in men and women of a wide age span. Methods: Urine sampling and body weight measurement were undertaken before and after recreational physical exercise (median time: 90 min) in 57 volunteers age 17â69 years (mean age: 42). Urine analysis included urine color, osmolality, specific gravity, and creatinine. Results: The volunteersâ body weight decreased 1.1\% (mean) while they exercised. There were strong correlations between all 4 urinary markers of dehydration (r = .73â.84, p < .001). Researchers constructed a composite dehydration index graded from 1 to 6 based on these markers. This index changed from 2.70 before exercising to 3.55 after exercising, which corresponded to dehydration of 1.0\% as given by a preliminary reference curve based on 7 previous studies in athletes. Men were slightly dehydrated at baseline (mean: 1.9\%) compared with women (mean: 0.7\%; p < .001), though age had no influence on the results. A final reference curve that considered both the present results and the 7 previous studies was constructed in which exercise-induced weight loss (x) was predicted by the exponential equation x = 0.20 dehydration index1.86. Conclusion: Urine sampling can be used to estimate weight loss due to dehydration in adults up to age 70. A robust dehydration index based on four indicators reduces the influence of confounders.},

  abstract      = {The human estrogen receptor {alpha} (ER) and the recently identified ERß share a high degree of amino acid homology; however, there are significant differences in regions of these receptors that would be expected to influence transcriptional activity. Consequently, we compared the mechanism(s) by which these receptors regulate target gene transcription, and evaluated the cellular consequences of coexpression of both ER subtypes. Previously, it has been determined that ER contains two distinct activation domains, ER{alpha}-AF-1 and ER{alpha}-AF-2, whose transcriptional activity is influenced by cell and promoter context. We determined that ERß, like ER{alpha}, contains a functional AF-2, however, the ERß-AF-2 domain functions independently within the receptor. Of additional significance was the finding that ERß does not contain a strong AF-1 within its amino-terminus but, rather, contains a repressor domain that when removed, increases the overall transcriptional activity of the receptor. The importance of these findings was revealed when it was determined that ERß functions as a transdominant inhibitor of ER transcriptional activity at subsaturating hormone levels and that ERß decreases overall cellular sensitivity to estradiol. Additionally, the partial agonist activity of tamoxifen manifest through ER{alpha} in some contexts was completely abolished upon coexpression of ERß. In probing the mechanisms underlying ERß-mediated repression of ER{alpha} transcriptional activity we have determined that 1) ER{alpha} and ERß can form heterodimers within target cells; and 2) ERß interacts with target gene promoters in a ligand-independent manner. Cumulatively, these data indicate that one role of ERß is to modulate ER{alpha} transcriptional activity, and thus the relative expression level of the two isoforms will be a key determinant of cellular responses to agonists and antagonists.},

  abstract      = {With the dawn of the next millennium at arm's length, many indi-
viduals are starting to engage in practices that lead to altered states
of consciousness. Altered states of consciousness refer to states
other than the normal waking state, including sleep, meditation, the
hypnotic trance, and the distorted perceptions that may be caused
by the use of certain drugs (Rathus, 1997, p. G1). Meditation is one
such process that alters one's consciousness. Meditation is a sys-
tematic narrowing of attention that slows the metabolism and helps
produce feelings of relaxation (Rathus, 1997, p. G13). There are
numerous forms of meditation, with two of the most used being
transcendental and Egyptian. The goal is the same, yet the process
is somewhat different.
Transcendental meditation is a simplified form of Far Eastern
meditation that was brought to the United States by the Maharishi
Mahesh Yogi in 1959 (Rathus, 1997). During the process, an indi-
vidual repeats and concentrates on a mantra. Mantras are words or
sounds that are claimed to have the capacity to help one achieve an
altered state of consciousness. Egyptian meditation involves focus-
ing on and visualizing an Egyptian symbol that represents a certain
quality or characteristic. The purpose of focusing on the symbol is
to obtain a particular goal (e.g., ward off enemies, to bring wealth or
happiness). It also involves chanting words of power that corre-
spond to the goal (Amen, 1990). Although these forms of
meditation may be slightly different, they both include the compo-
nents of proper breathing and post},

Loss of insect diversity and abundance is expected to provoke cascading effects on food webs and to jeopardize ecosystem services. Our understanding of the extent and underlying causes of this decline is based on the abundance of single species or taxonomic groups only, rather than changes in insect biomass which is more relevant for ecological functioning. Here, we used a standardized protocol to measure total insect biomass using Malaise traps, deployed over 27 years in 63 nature protection areas in Germany (96 unique location-year combinations) to infer on the status and trend of local entomofauna. Our analysis estimates a seasonal decline of 76%, and mid-summer decline of 82% in flying insect biomass over the 27 years of study. We show that this decline is apparent regardless of habitat type, while changes in weather, land use, and habitat characteristics cannot explain this overall decline. This yet unrecognized loss of insect biomass must be taken into account in evaluating declines in abundance of species depending on insects as a food source, and ecosystem functioning in the European landscape.},

  abstract      = {The neurotoxins produced by Clostridium botulinum are the most potent acute toxins known and are the causative agents of the neuroparalytic disease botulism. The toxins act primarily at peripheral cholinergic synapses by blocking the evoked release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. There are seven distinct serotypes of toxin. All are polypeptides of Mr about 150 kDa that have similar structure and pharmacological action. In their most active forms the toxins exist as dichain molecules in which a heavy (H) chain is linked by disulphide bonding to a light (L) chain. The H chain is believed to be associated with the highly specific and avid binding of toxin to the motor nerve end plates and also with the process of internalisation of the toxin. The toxic activity appears to be associated with the L chain which blockades the calcium-mediated release of acetylcholine, probably by interfering at the molecular level with the mechanisms whereby neurotransmitter-containing vesicles merge with the plasmalemma. The type A toxin is now used therapeutically to treat a variety of conditions involving involuntary muscle spasm. The therapeutic toxin is a neurotoxin-haemagglutinin complex isolated from cultures of C. botulinum. A controlled manufacturing process has been developed for the therapeutic toxin which is specially formulated to give a freeze-dried product having good stability.},

The study employed a longitudinal design and involved two sessions, with approximately 2.5 months between sessions. Session 1 occurred near the beginning of the men's college basketball season, and Session 2 occurred after the season. There was an indirect effect of interest in basketball on new basketball knowledge, via exposure to domain-relevant information. In addition, prior basketball knowledge had a strong effect on new basketball knowledge distinct from an influence through basketball exposure. This finding suggests that prior knowledge may provide a framework into which new knowledge can be integrated. By contrast, there was no effect of fluid intelligence on new basketball knowledge. Although somewhat surprising given evidence that this aspect of intelligence may play a role in the acquisition of certain types of knowledge, this finding accords with the view that knowledge is a major determinant of various aspects of cognitive functioning, including learning.},

Adults from wide ranges of working memory capacity, age, and knowledge about the game of baseball listened to, and then answered questions about, simulated radio broadcasts of baseball games. There was a strong facilitative effect of preexisting knowledge of baseball on memory performance, particularly for information judged to be directly relevant to the baseball games. However, there was a positive effect of working memory capacity on memory performance as well, and there was no indication that domain knowledge attenuated this effect. That is, working memory capacity contributed to memory performance even at high levels of domain knowledge. Similarly, there was no evidence that domain knowledge attenuated age-related differences (favoring young adults) in memory performance. We discuss implications of the results for understanding proficiency in cognitive domains from an individual-differences perspective.},

This study evaluated three hypotheses concerning the interplay between these factors. The compensation hypothesis predicts that domain knowledge attenuates the influence of working memory capacity on higher-level cognition, whereas the rich-get-richer hypothesis predicts that working memory capacity enhances use of domain knowledge. The independent influences hypothesis states simply that working memory capacity and domain knowledge make additive contributions to higher-level cognition. Participants representing wide ranges of working memory capacity and knowledge of baseball performed tasks that emphasized keeping track of information in a dynamic environment. The baseball task involved tracking the movements of baseball players on a baseball diamond. The spaceship task was structurally isomorphic to this task but its content was arbitrary. Results revealed greater use of baseball knowledge in the baseball task than in the spaceship task. However, even at high levels of baseball knowledge, this knowledge use did not alter the relationship between working memory capacity and task performance. This finding is inconsistent with compensation and rich-get-richer hypotheses. Instead, it suggests that working memory capacity and domain knowledge may operate independently under certain conditions.},

While the comparative approach focuses on the origin and change of traits, optimality studies assume that adaptations are maintained at an optimum by stabilizing selection. This paper presents a model of adaptive evolution on a macroevolutionary time scale that includes the maintenance of traits at adaptive optima by stabilizing selection as the dominant evolutionary force. Interspecific variation is treated as variation in the position of adaptive optima. The model illustrates how phylogenetic constraints not only lead to correlations between phylogenetically related species, but also to imperfect adaptations. From this model, a statistical comparative method is derived that can be used to estimate the effect of a selective factor on adaptive optima in a way that would be consistent with an optimality study of adaptation to this factor. The method is illustrated with an analysis of dental evolution in fossil horses. The use of comparative methods to study evolutionary trends is also discussed.},

This field is recognized as the developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD). We discuss the extent to which DOHaD represents the result of the physiological processes of developmental plasticity, which may have potential adverse consequences in terms of NCD risk later, or whether it is the manifestation of pathophysiological processes acting in early life but only becoming apparent as disease later. We argue that the evidence suggests the former, through the operation of conditioning processes induced across the normal range of developmental environments, and we summarize current knowledge of the physiological processes involved. The adaptive pathway to later risk accords with current concepts in evolutionary developmental biology, especially those concerning parental effects. Outside the normal range, effects on development can result in nonadaptive processes, and we review their underlying mechanisms and consequences. New concepts concerning the underlying epigenetic and other mechanisms involved in both disruptive and nondisruptive pathways to disease are reviewed, including the evidence for transgenerational passage of risk from both maternal and paternal lines. These concepts have wider implications for understanding the causes and possible prevention of NCDs such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, for broader social policy and for the increasing attention paid in public health to the lifecourse approach to NCD prevention.},

  abstract      = {Estrogen facilitates higher cognitive functions by exerting effects on brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Estrogen induces spinogenesis and synaptogenesis in these two brain regions and also initiates a complex set of signal transduction pathways via estrogen receptors (ERs). Along with the classical genomic effects mediated by activation of ER Î± and ER Î², there are membrane-bound ER Î±, ER Î², and G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1) that can mediate rapid nongenomic effects. All key ERs present throughout the body are also present in synapses of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. This review summarizes estrogen actions in the brain from the standpoint of their effects on synapse structure and function, noting also the synergistic role of progesterone. We first begin with a review of ER subtypes in the brain and how their abundance and distributions are altered with aging and estrogen loss (e.g., ovariectomy or menopause) in the rodent, monkey, and human brain. As there is much evidence that estrogen loss induced by menopause can exacerbate the effects of aging on cognitive functions, we then review the clinical trials of hormone replacement therapies and their effectiveness on cognitive symptoms experienced by women. Finally, we summarize studies carried out in nonhuman primate models of age- and menopause-related cognitive decline that are highly relevant for developing effective interventions for menopausal women. Together, we highlight a new understanding of how estrogen affects higher cognitive functions and synaptic health that go well beyond its effects on reproduction.},

Although previous studies have highlighted a stone tool-mediated shift from primarily plant-based to primarily meat-based diets as critical in the development of the brain and other human traits, we argue that digestible carbohydrates were also necessary to accommodate the increased metabolic demands of a growing brain. Furthermore, we acknowledge the adaptive role cooking played in improving the digestibility and palatability of key carbohydrates. We provide evidence that cooked starch, a source of preformed glucose, greatly increased energy availability to human tissues with high glucose demands, such as the brain, red blood cells, and the developing fetus. We also highlight the auxiliary role copy number variation in the salivary amylase genes may have played in increasing the importance of starch in human evolution following the origins of cooking. Salivary amylases are largely ineffective on raw crystalline starch, but cooking substantially increases both their energy-yielding potential and glycemia. Although uncertainties remain regarding the antiquity of cooking and the origins of salivary amylase gene copy number variation, the hypothesis we present makes a testable prediction that these events are correlated.},

We present the results of a study, in which sequential thermal desorption-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TD-GC-MS) and pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS) were combined with morphological analysis of plant microfossils, to identify material entrapped in dental calculus from five Neanderthal individuals from the north Spanish site of El Sidr{\'o}n. Our results provide the first molecular evidence for inhalation of wood-fire smoke and bitumen or oil shale and ingestion of a range of cooked plant foods. We also offer the first evidence for the use of medicinal plants by a Neanderthal individual. The varied use of plants that we have identified suggests that the Neanderthal occupants of El Sidr{\'o}n had a sophisticated knowledge of their natural surroundings which included the ability to select and use certain plants.},

often than in the general population.
Objectives: To describe the incidence of frostbite and the situations associated with it in mountaineering,
emphasising factors that can be modified to decrease its frequency and severity.
Methods: In this cross sectional, questionnaire based study, 637 mountaineers were asked if they had
suffered any frostbite injuries during the preceding two years and to provide the personal and
circumstantial details.
Results: The mean incidence was 366/1000 population per year. Grade 1 injury (83.0%) and hands
(26.4%) and feet (24.1%) involvement were most common. There was a significant relation between lack of
proper equipment (odds ratio 14.3) or guide (p,0.001) and the injury. Inappropriate clothing, lack or
incorrect use of equipment, and lack of knowledge of how to deal with cold and severe weather were
claimed to be the main reasons for the injury.
Conclusions: In high altitude and winter expeditions, mountaineers should wear appropriate clothing,
have the necessary equipment such as quality boots and mittens, use a competent guide, and have training
on how to tackle cold weather. They should also avoid wet clothing, windy terrains, and should never
remain in the same position for long periods to reduce the risk of cold injuries.},

Application to 213 phenotypes and 1,544 TF binding datasets identified 2,264 relationships between hundreds of TFs and 94 phenotypes, including androgen receptor in prostate cancer and GATA3 in breast cancer. Strikingly, nearly half of systemic lupus erythematosus risk loci are occupied by the EpsteinâBarr virus EBNA2 protein and many coclustering human TFs, showing geneâenvironment interaction. Similar EBNA2-anchored associations exist in multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, type 1 diabetes, juvenile idiopathic arthritis and celiac disease. Instances of allele-dependent DNA binding and downstream effects on gene expression at plausibly causal variants support genetic mechanisms dependent on EBNA2. Our results nominate mechanisms that operate across risk loci within disease phenotypes, suggesting new models for disease origins.},

Using growth mixture modeling, two groups were identified with discrete growth patterns of loneliness: (a) relatively high, reducing loneliness (48%), and (b) low, stable loneliness (52%). At age 11 years, those in the relatively high, reducing lonely group reported higher levels of depressive symptoms, poorer general health, took longer to get to sleep, and had greater sleep disturbance than children in the low, stable loneliness group. These findings suggest that there may be long-term health effects of experiencing high loneliness in middle childhood, even when loneliness levels reduce to normal levels at pre-adolescence.},

In humans, there is strong evidence for such trends in the incidences of testicular and female breast cancer, and concern has also been expressed regarding semen quality, cryptorchidism, hypospadias and polycystic ovaries. Laboratory studies have indicated that some chemicals in the environment, both natural and synthetic, have the potential to disrupt the endocrine system and that these could, at least theoretically, be partly responsible for the observed changes. Chemicals thus identified include the naturally occurring steroid hormones, phyto- and myco-estrogens, and anthropogenic chemicals such as synthetic hormones, organotins, organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, dioxins, alkylphenol polyethoxylates, phthalates and bisphenol-A. While there is no direct evidence from human studies to confirm a causal link between exposure and effect, concern exists and is strengthened by reports of adverse reproductive and developmental effects in wildlife, possibly mediated via endocrine disruptive pathways. The development of imposex in neogastropod molluscs exposed to tributyltin has been attributed to such a mechanism and in wild populations of fish, alligators and birds, instances of masculinisation or feminisation in polluted areas have been noted. Among mammals, disturbed fertility of Florida panthers and some marine species has also been reported. A concentrated research and monitoring programme is required to clarify the nature and extent of effects on reproductive health in humans and wildlife, and to assess human and wildlife exposure to relevant naturally occurring or anthropogenic endocrine disrupting substances. This will enable a more robust evaluation of the contribution that environmental chemical exposure may have on adverse trends in the reproductive health of humans and wildlife.},

  abstract      = {Caffeine increases blood pressure (BP). In men, acute BP
elevations after caffeine intake are due to an increase in
vascular resistance, with no change in cardiac output.
The hemodynamic effects of caffeine have not been
studied in women. Accordingly, BP and hemodynamic
responses to caffeine were measured in a double-blind
trial comparing age-matched men and women at rest
and during mental stress. Caffeine (3.3 mg/kg, equivalent
to 2 to 3 cups of brewed coffee) or placebo was
given to separate groups of women (n  21 and 21) and
men (n  16 and 19) (mean ages 29 and 27 years,
respectively). BP, cardiac output, and vascular resistance
were observed at rest, during a stressful public-speaking
simulation, reading aloud, and recovery. Caffeine
caused nearly identical systolic and diastolic BP elevations
in women (4.5 and 3.3 mm Hg, respectively) and
men (4.1 and 3.8 mm Hg, respectively). Men given
caffeine versus placebo showed the expected elevation
in vascular resistance throughout the remainder of the
protocol (p <0.001), with no difference in cardiac output.
In contrast, women responded to caffeine with increases
in stroke volume (p <0.001) and cardiac output
(p <0.001), with no difference in vascular resistance
from women taking placebo. Men and women have
similar BP responses to caffeine, but the BP responses
may arise from different hemodynamic mechanisms.
Women who consume a dietary dose of caffeine showed
an increase in cardiac output, whereas men showed
increased vascular resistance. 2004 by Excerpta

can be avoided with careful attention during the diet’s initiation
and maintenance phases. In the last decade, variations to
the classical ketogenic diet have been utilized. Ketogenic diets
now are being used for diseases other than epilepsy. This critical

This paper discusses the views and activities of selfâidentified Satanists in Britain, especially the Temple of Set, the Church of Satan, the Order of the Nine Angles and Dark Lily. It also comments on ad hoc, adolescent and multiâgenerational Satanism. Satanism is a series of techniques for allowing individuals to affirm, develop and express themselves, and to do what they wish to do in the context of a spirituality. It does not require belief in the Satan of the Christian pantheon although thriving on the sinister image and the hostility it can evoke in Christians and the media. Satanism is an adversarial form of selfâreligion. },

of a few days' duration may lead to reduced brain glucose
metabolism due to the change toward ketone body con­
sumption. In the present study we measured the cerebral
metabolism of glucose and ketone bodies in nine healthy
volunteers before and after 3.5 days of starvation. Re­
gional glucose metabolism was measured by dynamic
positron emission tomography using [18F]2-fluoro-2-
deoxy-n-glucose. The mean value of Kj in gray and white
matter increased by 12% (p < 0.05), whereas kj, and kj
were unchanged compared with control values. Regional
glucose metabolism in cortical gray matter was reduced
by 26% from 0.294 ± 0.054 to 0.217 ± 0.040 IJ.mol g-I

creased by 27% (p < 0.02). The decrease was uniform in gray and white matter with regional decreases ranging
from 24 to 30%. A determination using Fick's principle
confirmed the reduction in glucose metabolism yielding a
decrease of 24% from 0.307 ± 0.050 to 0.233 ± 0.073

and pyruvate did not change significantly during starva­
tion. The present study shows that the human brain
adapts to the changes in energy supply as early as 3 days
following initiation of starvation, at which time ketone

  abstract      = {Two alternative hypotheses have been proposed to explain how social and genetic mating systems are interrelated in birds. According to the first (male trade-off) hypothesis, social polygyny should increase extrapair fertilizations because when males concentrate on attracting additional social mates, they cannot effectively protect females with whom they have already paired from being sexually assaulted. According to the second (female choice) hypothesis, social polygyny should decrease extrapair fertilizations because a substantial proportion of females can pair with the male of their choice, and males can effectively guard each mate during her fertile period. To discriminate these alternatives, we comprehensively reviewed information on social mating systems and extrapair fertilizations in temperate zone passerine birds. We found significant inverse relationships between proportions of socially polygynous males and frequencies of extrapair young, whether each species was considered as an inde- pendent data point (using parametric statistics) or phylogenetically related species were treated as nonindependent (using contrasts analyses). When social mating systems were dichotomized, extrapair chicks were twice as frequent in monogamous as in polygynous species (0.23 vs. 0.11). We hypothesize that in socially polygynous species, (1) there is less incentive for females and males to pursue extrapair matings and (2) females incur higher costs for sexual infidelity (e.g., due to physical retaliation or reduction of paternal efforts) than in socially monogamous species.

Therefore, health consequences related to cold exposure represent also in the future the majority of climate-related adverse health effects. Hot summers may be an exception. At ambient temperatures below +10 - +12Â°C, humans experience cold stress of varying degree. Man can compensate a 10Â°C change in ambient temperature by changing metabolic heat production by 30â40 W m-2 or by wearing an additional/taking off ca. 0.4 clo units (corresponding to one thick clothing layer). Cold ambient temperature may be a risk for human health and cause varying levels of performance limitations. The impacts of cold exposure on health and wellbeing cause a burden to many societies in terms of lowered productivity and higher costs related to health care systems as well as public health planning and management. In order to provide preventive and protective public health actions for cold-induced adverse health effects, it is important to recognize cold related injuries, illnesses and symptoms and their turn-up temperatures, and to identify the most at-risk population subgroups and factors that increase or decrease the health risks posed by cold ambient temperatures. The majority of cold-related harmful health impacts can be prevented or managed by correct preventive and protective actions. Rapid unpredictable changes are more difficult to compensate because of lack of experience (affecting attitude and skills), preparedness (vehicles, garments, supplies, logistics etc.) and/or acclimatization.

Yet it is not clear whether men or women have become more frequently---or more intensely sexualized---over time. In a longitudinal content analysis of images of women and men on more than four decades of Rolling Stone magazine covers (1967--2009), we begin to answer such questions. Using a unique analytical framework that allows us to measure both the frequency and intensity of sexualization, we find that sexualized images of men and women have increased, though women continue to be more frequently sexualized than men. Yet our most striking finding is the change in how women---but not men---are sexualized. Women are increasingly likely to be ``hypersexualized,'' but men are not. These findings not only document changes in the sexualization of men and women in popular culture over time, they also point to a narrowing of the culturally acceptable ways for ``doing'' femininity as presented in popular media.},

 We have developed a quantitative method for measuring hair growth using optical microscopy and image analysis, and have used this to investigate the rate of growth in subjects with and without alopecia. The hairs were cut from an area 7â8 mm in diameter and 24 h and 72 h later, images of the areas were obtained using an optical microscope and were recorded on a video disc. Measurements of the regrowing hairs, placed parallel to the scalp using a glass slide attached to the front of the microscope, were made using the image analyser.In subjects with little or no baldness there was a clear difference between fast-growing hairs and resting or slow-growing hairs. However, in subjects with alopecia there was no such difference and the growth rate of all the hairs showed a continuous distribution. Using this method other parameters such as the number of hairs per unit area and hair diameter as well as grouping of the hairs could be measured.},

Circulating concentrations of glucose, ketone bodies, potential gluconeogenic substrates and glucoregulatory hormones were determined at frequent intervals. In the postprandial state (1–14 hr fasting), substrate and hormone concentrations were similar in all groups with the exception of plasma glutamine concentrations which were higher in men (640 ± 20 μM) than in women or children (490 ± 20 μM and 480 ± 50 μM, respectively, p < 0.01 for both). Following 30 hr fasting children had the lowest glucose (53 ± 3 mg/dl) and alanine (167 ± 17 μM) concentrations and men had the highest (72 ± 3 mg/dl and 279 ± 16 μM, respectively) whereas those of women were intermediate (64 ± 3 mg/dl and 226 ± 19 μM, respectively). Following 30 hr of fasting, betahydroxybutyrate concentrations were highest in children and lowest in men (the children, 3.7 ± 0.4 mM; women, 1.7 ± 0.2 mM and men 0.9 ± 0.2 mM, p < 0.02 between all groups). An inverse relationship (p < 0.001) was observed between beta-hydroxybutyrate and glucose concentrations throughout the fast for each group (r > 0.92). Although plasma cortisol concentrations were higher in women and children when compared to those of the men, no differences in growth hormone, glucagon, or insulin concentrations were observed among the three groups studied. Differences in plasma substrate responses to fasting among the groups studied may reflect differences in glucose requirements among men, women and children, as well as the relative availability of both gluconeogenic substrate and ketone bodies.},

We found that jaguars significantly preferred capybara Hydrochaeris hydrochaeris and giant anteater Myrmecophaga tridactyla, and avoided agoutis, carnivorans, primates, black-eared opossum Didelphis marsupialis and tapirs. Generalized linear models showed that jaguars select prey primarily based on socio-ecological and behavioral traits (abundance and herd size), rather than morphological characteristics (body size). Nonetheless, their accessible prey weight range was 6–60 kg, preferred prey weight range was 45–85 kg, and mean mass of significantly preferred prey was 32 ± 13 kg leading to a predator to prey body mass ratio of 1:0.53, which is much less than that of other solitary felids (although 1:0.84 may be the relationship with the smallest jaguars). Compared with other large, solitary felids, jaguars have an unusual predator to prey body mass ratio, show limited effect of prey morphology as a driver of prey selection, lack evidence of optimal foraging beyond their preferred prey, and a lack of preferential hunting on Cetartiodactyla herbivores. These features, coupled with the reduction in jaguar body mass since the Pleistocene, suggest that the loss of larger potential prey items within the preferred and accessible weight ranges at the end-Pleistocene still affects jaguar predatory behavior. It may be that jaguars survived this mass extinction event by preferentially preying on relatively small species.},

  abstract      = {Bullying and harassment by school peers has received increasing attention as their relation to personal problems and more extreme forms of violence has become better recognized. Emphases of empirical studies have focused on characteristics and behaviours of both school bullies and their victims. There is a need to place these traits and actions into the context of the situation in which they occur, in order to expand the research and allow for the development of more sophisticated and comprehensive educational, prevention and intervention programmes. A total 251 professionals (teachers and counsellors) participated in this empirical study on the ability of professionals to differentiate between bullying and other forms of conflict. Participants were asked to judge the severity of 21 scenarios depicting different combinations of situational characteristics and also whether they constituted bullying situations or not. Results indicated that physical threat or abuse was seen as more severe than verbal or social/emotional abuse, and professionals more often rated physical conflicts as bullying even when they did not fit the definition. The repeated nature of an abusive relationship and an unfair match between participants were bullying situation characteristics found to be related to the responses of more and less effective situation evaluators. Implications for pre- and in-service training of educators were considered based on study results and previous research.},

We examine individual income for men 1970â2007 and family income for both men and women 1980â2007. During this period, income inequality increased in most western countries, but especially so in Sweden. Drawing on a large sample of the Swedish population, our results show that the gap in life expectancy between the richest and poorest fifths of the income distribution also increased. This was the case both for individual and family income. The increase was larger for men than for women, but the only group with stagnant life expectancy at age 35 was women in the lowest income quintile group. Between 1986 and 2007, the difference between the lowest and highest family income quintiles increased by about one year for women and by almost two years for men. The causes of death that most significantly contributed to the increased disparities among women were circulatory and respiratory diseases. For men, circulatory disease mortality alone caused most of the increased disparities.},

Fattiga kvinnor de enda som inte {\"{o}}kar sin livsl{\"{a}}ngd
Skillnaderna i livsl{\"{a}}ngd {\"{o}}kar mellan rik och fattig, det visar en ny svensk forskningsrapport. Och f{\"{o}}r en grupp har livsl{\"{a}}ngden st{\r{a}}tt i stort sett still sedan 80-talet, de fattiga kvinnorna.
– Det {\"{a}}r n{\r{a}}gonting som inte fungerat, s{\"{a}}ger professor Markus J{\"{a}}ntti, en av f{\"{o}}rfattarna till forskningsstudien.

Livsl{\"{a}}ngden {\"{o}}kar i Sverige, men den {\"{o}}kar mer f{\"{o}}r den som {\"{a}}r rik och mindre f{\"{o}}r de med l{\"{a}}gre inkomster, det visar en studie gjord vid SOFI (Institutet f{\"{o}}r social forskning) vid Stockholms universitet.

”V{\"{a}}lf{\"{a}}rdssystemet n{\r{a}}r inte alla”
Rapporten studerar en period d{\r{a}} inkomstskillnaderna {\"{o}}kat snabbare i Sverige {\"{a}}n i n{\r{a}}got annat OECD-land. Under de n{\"{a}}stan trettio {\r{a}}ren kunde m{\"{a}}n med de h{\"{o}}gsta inkomsterna {\"{o}}ka sin f{\"{o}}rv{\"{a}}ntade livsl{\"{a}}ngd med sex {\r{a}}r. M{\"{a}}nnen med de l{\"{a}}gsta inkomsterna {\"{o}}kade sin f{\"{o}}rv{\"{a}}ntade livsl{\"{a}}ngd med tre {\r{a}}r. 

Men medan resten av befolkningen {\"{o}}kar sin livsl{\"{a}}ngd i olika grad st{\r{a}}r det samtidigt s{\r{a}} gott som still f{\"{o}}r kvinnorna med l{\"{a}}gst inkomst. Deras f{\"{o}}rv{\"{a}}ntade livsl{\"{a}}ngd har knappt {\"{o}}kat alls p{\r{a}} flera decennier.

– Det h{\"{a}}r tyder p{\r{a}} att v{\"{a}}lf{\"{a}}rdssystemet i Sverige inte n{\r{a}}r alla, s{\"{a}}ger Markus J{\"{a}}ntti, professor i nationalekonomi.

Utvecklingen st{\r{a}}tt still i 30 {\r{a}}r
I gruppen {\r{a}}terfinns framf{\"{o}}r allt deltidsarbetande i l{\r{a}}gl{\"{o}}neyrken. Det kan handla om till exempel undersk{\"{o}}terskor, butiksanst{\"{a}}llda och barnsk{\"{o}}tare. F{\"{o}}r deras del har utvecklingen n{\"{a}}r det g{\"{a}}ller livsl{\"{a}}ngd st{\r{a}}tt s{\r{a}} gott som still i trettio {\r{a}}r.

Markus J{\"{a}}ntti menar att denna oj{\"{a}}mlikhet r{\"{o}}r det mest grundl{\"{a}}ggande: livet sj{\"{a}}lvt.

– Att framstegen i {\"{o}}kad livsl{\"{a}}ngd framf{\"{o}}r allt g{\r{a}}tt till de som har b{\"{a}}ttre resurser, det tycker jag {\"{a}}r anm{\"{a}}rkningsv{\"{a}}rt. Det {\"{a}}r helt enkelt ett folkh{\"{a}}lsoproblem.

Studien heter ”Trends in Life Expectancy by Income and the Role of Specific Causes of Death” och {\"{a}}r publicerad i tidskriften Economica. F{\"{o}}rfattare {\"{a}}r Markus J{\"{a}}ntti, Karin Hederos, Lena Lindahl samt Jenny Torssander. 

Studien f{\"{o}}ljer utvecklingen 1970 – 2007 och utg{\r{a}}r fr{\r{a}}n 35-{\r{a}}ringar och deras f{\"{o}}rv{\"{a}}ntade livsl{\"{a}}ngd. Det handlar om m{\"{a}}nniskor f{\"{o}}dda 1932 – 1967. I den m{\r{a}}n invandrare {\"{a}}r inkluderade i studien handlar det om de som kommit till Sverige f{\"{o}}re 1968.

Studien visar att {\r{a}}r 2007 hade en genomsnittlig 35-{\r{a}}rig kvinna i den l{\"{a}}gsta inkomstgruppen 45 {\r{a}}r kvar att leva. En kvinna med h{\"{o}}gre inkomster hade en f{\"{o}}rv{\"{a}}ntad {\r{a}}terst{\r{a}}ende livsl{\"{a}}ngd p{\r{a}} 52 {\r{a}}r.

We sought to determine a practical minimal disinfecting concentration of 10% \{PVI\} over different contact times and temperatures when added to water inoculated with E. coli. Methods 1:100, 1:1,000, and 1:10,000 dilutions of 10% \{PVI\} were created. Escherichia coli was exposed to these dilutions for 5, 15, and 30 minutes at 10, 20, and 30Â°C. Bactericidal activity was neutralized with 0.5% sodium thiosulfate. Mean viable colony forming units (CFUs) was determined after triplicate plating on Luria-bertani agar and 24 hours of incubation at 37Â°C. Effective bactericidal activity was defined as a 5-log reduction. Results Of the 200,000 E. coli plated, no \{CFUs\} were observed after exposure to the 1:100 dilution. After 5 minutes of contact time with the 1:1,000 dilution, at 10Â°C \{CFUs\} were too numerous to count (TNTC), at 20Â°C the mean \{CFU\} count was 92 (standard error Â±11), and at 30Â°C the mean \{CFU\} count was 25 (standard error Â±8). No \{CFUs\} were observed after 15 minutes of exposure to the 1:1,000 dilution across experimental temperatures. The 1:10,000 dilution always yielded \{CFU\} growth that was TNTC. Conclusions The lowest disinfecting concentration of 10% \{PVI\} was the 1:1,000 dilution at 15 minutes of contact time. This supports the use of \{PVI\} for water disinfection against E. coli, the organism most commonly responsible for traveler's diarrhea. Further studies may assess its effectiveness against more virulent water borne pathogens. },

  abstract      = {Polyspermy is a major puzzle in reproductive biology. In some taxa, multiple sperm enter the ovum as part of the normal fertilization process, whereas in others, penetration of the ovum by more than one sperm is lethal. In birds, several sperm typically enter the germinal disc, yet only one fuses with the female pronucleus. It is unclear whether supernumerary sperm play an essential role in the avian fertilization process and, if they do, how females regulate the progression of sperm through the oviduct to ensure an appropriate number reach the ovum. Here, we show that when very few sperm penetrate the avian ovum, embryos are unlikely to survive beyond the earliest stages of development. We also show that when the number of inseminated sperm is limited, a greater proportion than expected reach and penetrate the ovum, indicating that females compensate for low sperm numbers in the oviduct. Our results suggest a functional role for supernumerary sperm in the processes of fertilization and early embryogenesis, providing an exciting expansion of our understanding of sperm function in birds.},

Methods A systematic review of all the available evidence, including worldwide published literature and spontaneous case reports provided by healthcare professionals and regulatory authorities within Europe has been undertaken. Results A number of clinically significant interactions have been identified with prescribed medicines including warfarin, phenprocoumon, cyclosporin, HIV protease inhibitors, theophylline, digoxin and oral contraceptives resulting in a decrease in concentration or effect of the medicines. These interactions are probably due to the induction of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP1A2 and the transport protein P-glycoprotein by constituent(s) in SJW. The degree of induction is unpredictable due to factors such as the variable quality and quantity of constituent(s) in SJW preparations. In addition, possible pharmacodynamic interactions with selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors and serotonin (5-HT1d) receptor-agonists such as triptans used to treat migraine were identified. These interactions are associated with an increased risk of adverse reactions. Conclusions In Sweden and the UK the potential risks to patients were judged to be significant and therefore information about the interactions was provided to health care professionals and patients. The product information of the licensed medicines involved has been amended to reflect these newly identified interactions and SJW preparations have been voluntarily labelled with appropriate warnings. },

  abstract      = {Being an air-traffic controller is not easy. At the heart of the job is a cognitive ability called ‘situational awareness’ that involves ‘the continuous extraction of environmental information [and the] integration of this information with prior knowledge to form a coherent mental picture’. Vast amounts of fluid information must be held in the mind and, under extreme pressure, life-or-death decisions are made across rotating 24-hour work schedules. So stressful and mentally demanding is the job that, in most countries, air-traffic controllers are eligible for early retirement. In the United States, they must retire at 56 without exception.

In the 1960s, an interesting series of experiments was done on air-traffic controllers’ mental capacities. Researchers wanted to explore if they had a general enhanced ability to ‘keep track of a number of things at once’ and whether that skill could be applied to other situations. After observing them at their work, researchers gave the air-traffic controllers a set of generic memory-based tasks with shapes and colours. The extraordinary thing was that, when tested on these skills outside their own area of expertise, the air-traffic controllers did no better than anyone else. Their remarkably sophisticated cognitive abilities did not translate beyond their professional area.

Since the early 1980s, however, schools have become ever more captivated by the idea that students must learn a set of generalised thinking skills to flourish in the contemporary world – and especially in the contemporary job market. Variously called ‘21st-century learning skills’ or ‘critical thinking’, the aim is to equip students with a set of general problem-solving approaches that can be applied to any given domain; these are lauded by business leaders as an essential set of dispositions for the 21st century. Naturally, we want children and graduates to have a set of all-purpose cognitive tools with which to navigate their way through the world. It’s a shame, then, that we’ve failed to apply any critical thinking to the question of whether any such thing can be taught.

As the 1960s studies on air-traffic controllers suggested, to be good in a specific domain you need to know a lot about it: it’s not easy to translate those skills to other areas. This is even more so with the kinds of complex and specialised knowledge that accompanies much professional expertise: as later studies found, the more complex the domain, the more important domain-specific knowledge. This non-translatability of cognitive skill is well-established in psychological research and has been replicated many times. Other studies, for example, have shown that the ability to remember long strings of digits doesn’t transfer to the ability to remember long strings of letters. Surely we’re not surprised to hear this, for we all know people who are ‘clever’ in their professional lives yet who often seem to make stupid decisions in their personal lives.

In almost every arena, the higher the skill level, the more specific the expertise is likely to become. In a football team, for example, there are different ‘domains’ or positions: goalkeeper, defender, attacker. Within those, there are further categories: centre-back, full-back, attacking midfielder, holding midfielder, attacking player. Now, it might be fine for a bunch of amateurs, playing a friendly game, to move positions. But, at a professional level, if you put a left-back in a striker’s position or a central midfielder in goal, the players would be lost. For them to make excellent, split-second decisions, and to enact robust and effective strategies, they need thousands of specific mental models – and thousands of hours of practice to create those models – all of which are specific and exclusive to a position.

Of course, critical thinking is an essential part of a student’s mental equipment. However, it cannot be detached from context. Teaching students generic ‘thinking skills’ separate from the rest of their curriculum is meaningless and ineffective. As the American educationalist Daniel Willingham puts it:

[I]f you remind a student to ‘look at an issue from multiple perspectives’ often enough, he will learn that he ought to do so, but if he doesn’t know much about an issue, he can’t think about it from multiple perspectives … critical thinking (as well as scientific thinking and other domain-based thinking) is not a skill. There is not a set of critical thinking skills that can be acquired and deployed regardless of context.

This detachment of cognitive ideals from contextual knowledge is not confined to the learning of critical thinking. Some schools laud themselves for placing ‘21st-century learning skills’ at the heart of their mission. It’s even been suggested that some of these nebulous skills are now as important as literacy and should be afforded the same status. An example of this is brain-training games that claim to help kids become smarter, more alert and able to learn faster. However, recent research has shown that brain-training games are really only good for one thing – getting good a brain-training games. The claim that they offer students a general set of problem-solving skills was recently debunked by a study that reviewed more than 130 papers, which concluded:

[W]e know of no evidence for broad-based improvement in cognition, academic achievement, professional performance, and/or social competencies that derives from decontextualised practice of cognitive skills devoid of domain-specific content.

The same goes for teaching ‘dispositions’ such as the ‘growth mindset’ (focusing on will and effort as opposed to inherent talent) or ‘grit’ (determination in the face of obstacles). It’s not clear that these dispositions can be taught, and there’s no evidence that teaching them outside a specific subject matter has any effect.

Instead of teaching generic critical-thinking skills, we ought to focus on subject-specific critical-thinking skills that seek to broaden a student’s individual subject knowledge and unlock the unique, intricate mysteries of each subject. For example, if a student of literature knows that Mary Shelley’s mother died shortly after Mary was born and that Shelley herself lost a number of children in infancy, that student’s appreciation of Victor Frankenstein’s obsession with creating life from death, and the language used to describe it, is more enhanced than approaching the text without this knowledge. A physics student investigating why two planes behave differently in flight might know how to ‘think critically’ through the scientific method but, without solid knowledge of contingent factors such as outside air temperature and a bank of previous case studies to draw upon, the student will struggle to know which hypothesis to focus on and which variables to discount.

As Willingham writes: ‘Thought processes are intertwined with what is being thought about.’ Students need to be given real and significant things from the world to think with and about, if teachers want to influence how they do that thinking.},

Tests enhance later retention more than additional study of the material, even when tests are given without feedback. This surprising phenomenon is called the testing effect, and although it has been studied by cognitive psychologists sporadically over the years, today there is a renewed effort to learn why testing is effective and to apply testing in educational settings. In this article, we selectively review laboratory studies that reveal the power of testing in improving retention and then turn to studies that demonstrate the basic effects in educational settings. We also consider the related concepts of dynamic testing and formative assessment as other means of using tests to improve learning. Finally, we consider some negative consequences of testing that may occur in certain circumstances, though these negative effects are often small and do not cancel out the large positive effects of testing. Frequent testing in the classroom may boost educational achievement at all levels of education.},

Lifetime anal sex was reported by 43% of men (insertive) and 37% of women (receptive). Common lifetime sexual behaviors included wearing sexy lingerie/underwear (75% women, 26% men), sending/receiving digital nude/semi-nude photos (54% women, 65% men), reading erotic stories (57% of participants), public sex (â¥43%), role-playing (â¥22%), tying/being tied up (â¥20%), spanking (â¥30%), and watching sexually explicit videos/DVDs (60% women, 82% men). Having engaged in threesomes (10% women, 18% men) and playful whipping (â¥13%) were less common. Lifetime group sex, sex parties, taking a sexuality class/workshop, and going to BDSM parties were uncommon (each <8%). More Americans identified behaviors as âappealingâ than had engaged in them. Romantic/affectionate behaviors were among those most commonly identified as appealing for both men and women. The appeal of particular behaviors was associated with greater odds that the individual had ever engaged in the behavior. This study contributes to our understanding of more diverse adult sexual behaviors than has previously been captured in U.S. nationally representative probability surveys. Implications for sexuality educators, clinicians, and individuals in the general population are discussed.},

Here, we present a computational model of the mechanics, control and energetics that unifies some well-known scale effects in running quadrupeds. The model consists of dynamic, physics-based simulations of six running mammals ranging in size from a chipmunk to a horse (0.115-676 kg). The `virtual animals' are made up of rigid segments (head, trunk and four legs) linked by joints and are similar in morphology to particular species. In the model, each stance limb acts as a spring operating within a narrow range of stiffness, forward motion is powered and controlled by active hip and shoulder torques, and metabolic cost is predicted from the time course of supporting body weight. Model parameters that are important for stability (joint stiffnesses, limb-retraction times and target positions and velocities of the limbs) are selected such that (i) running kinematics (aerial height, forward speed and body pitch) is smooth and periodic and (ii) overall leg stiffness is in agreement with published data. Both trotting and galloping gaits are modeled, and comparisons across size are made at speeds that are physiologically similar among species. Model predictions are in agreement with data on vertical stiffness, limb angles, metabolic cost of transport, stride frequency, peak force and duty factor. This work supports the idea that a single, integrative model can predict important features of running across size by employing simple strategies to control overall leg stiffness. More broadly, the model provides a quantitative framework for testing hypotheses that relate limb control, stability and metabolic cost.

Demographic data from fifty-seven preindustrial societies indicate that the demographic structure of a population can be useful for understanding intercultural variability in caregiving practices identified in "traditional" characterizations of childcare in these populations (e.g., indulgent care, multiple caregivers, multiage play groups). Analysis of demographic structures also identifies two "emergent" features of childcare in preindustrial populations that are infrequently mentioned in socialization studies of these populations: stepparent-stepchild relations and differential investment in sons and daughters.},

  abstract      = {AbstractBackground Glenohumeral internal rotation deficit (GIRD) is a risk factor for shoulder and elbow injury in baseball players. Although this evidence forms a basis for recommending stretching, clinical measures of internal rotation range of motion (ROM) do not differentiate if \{GIRD\} is due to muscular, capsuloligamentous, or osseous factors. Understanding the contributions of these structures to \{GIRD\} is important for the development of targeted interventions. We hypothesize that the osseous component will have the greatest relative contribution to GIRD, followed by muscle stiffness and posterior capsule thickness. Methods Internal rotation ROM, muscle stiffness (teres minor, infraspinatus, and posterior deltoid), posterior capsule thickness, and humeral retrotorsion were evaluated on 156 baseball players. A side-to-side difference was calculated for each variable. Variables were entered into a multivariable linear regression to determine the significant predictors of GIRD. Results The regression model was statistically significant (R2Â =Â 0.134, F(1, 156)Â =Â 24.0, pÂ &lt;Â 0.01) with only humeral retrotorsion difference remaining as a significant predictor (Î²Â =Â â0.243, t156Â =Â â4.9, pÂ &lt;Â 0.01). A greater humeral retrotorsion side-to-side difference was associated with more GIRD. Conclusion Humeral retrotorsion accounted for 13.3% of the variance in GIRD. The stiffness of the superficial shoulder muscles and capsular thickness, as measured in this study, were not predictors of GIRD. Factors not assessed in this study, such as deeper muscle stiffness, capsule/ligament laxity, and neuromuscular regulation of muscle stiffness may also contribute to GIRD. Since it is the largest contributor to GIRD, causes of changes in humeral retrotorsion need to be identified. The osseous component only accounted for 13.3% of the variance in GIRD, indicating a large contribution from soft tissues factors that were not addressed in this study. These factors need to be identified to develop evidence-based evaluations and intervention programs to decrease the risk of injury in baseball players. },

Using a value added approach, we find that students at upper-secondary voucher schools on average score 0.06 standard deviations lower on externally graded standardized tests in first year core courses. The negative impact is larger among lower achieving students (but not among immigrant students), the same students who are most prone to attend voucher schools. For high achieving students, the voucher school impact is around zero. Comparing internal and external evaluations of the exact same standardized tests, we find that voucher schools are 0.14 standard deviations more generous than municipal schools in their internal test grading. The greater leniency in test grading is more pronounced among students at academic than at vocational programs. The findings are consistent with voucher schools responding more strongly to differences in educational preferences than municipal schools.},

At the apex of this boom is the introduction of applications (âappsâ) for tablets and smartphones. However, there is simply not the time, money, or resources available to evaluate each app as it enters the market. Thus, âeducationalâ appsâthe number of which, as of January 2015, stood at 80,000 in Appleâs App Store (Apple, 2015)âare largely unregulated and untested. This article offers a way to define the potential educational impact of current and future apps. We build upon decades of work on the Science of Learning, which has examined how children learn best. From this work, we abstract a set of principles for two ultimate goals. First, we aim to guide researchers, educators, and designers in evidence-based app development. Second, by creating an evidence-based guide, we hope to set a new standard for evaluating and selecting the most effective existing childrenâs apps. In short, we will show how the design and use of educational apps aligns with known processes of childrenâs learning and development and offer a framework that can be used by parents and designers alike. Apps designed to promote active, engaged, meaningful, and socially interactive learningâfour âpillarsâ of learningâwithin the context of a supported learning goal are considered educational. },

Here, we provide a general scaling model of maximum speed with body mass, which holds across locomotion modes, ecosystem types and taxonomic groups. In contrast to traditional power-law scaling, we predict a hump-shaped relationship resulting from a finite acceleration time for animals, which explains why the largest animals are not the fastest. This model is strongly supported by extensive empirical data (474 species, with body masses ranging from 30âÎ¼g to 100âtonnes) from terrestrial as well as aquatic ecosystems. Our approach unravels a fundamental constraint on the upper limit of animal movement, thus enabling a better understanding of realized movement patterns in nature and their multifold ecological consequences.},

  abstract      = {BACKGROUND:Recent work on the complexity of life highlights the roles played by evolutionary forces at different levels of individuality. One of the central puzzles in explaining transitions in individuality for entities ranging from complex cells, to multicellular organisms and societies, is how different autonomous units relinquish control over their functions to others in the group. In addition to the necessity of reducing conflict over effecting specialized tasks, differentiating groups must control the exploitation of the commons, or else be out-competed by more fit groups.RESULTS:We propose that two forms of conflict - access to resources within groups and representation in germ line - may be resolved in tandem through individual and group-level selective effects. Specifically, we employ an optimization model to show the conditions under which different within-group social behaviors (cooperators producing a public good or cheaters exploiting the public good) may be selected to disperse, thereby not affecting the commons and functioning as germ line. We find that partial or complete dispersal specialization of cheaters is a general outcome. The propensity for cheaters to disperse is highest with intermediate benefit:cost ratios of cooperative acts and with high relatedness. An examination of a range of real biological systems tends to support our theory, although additional study is required to provide robust tests.CONCLUSION:We suggest that trait linkage between dispersal and cheating should be operative regardless of whether groups ever achieve higher levels of individuality, because individual selection will always tend to increase exploitation, and stronger group structure will tend to increase overall cooperation through kin selected benefits. Cheater specialization as dispersers offers simultaneous solutions to the evolution of cooperation in social groups and the origin of specialization of germ and soma in multicellular organisms.},

Whereas otariids (fur seals and sea lions) possess stiff streamlined forelimb flippers, phocine seals (northern true seals) have retained a webbed yet mobile paw bearing sharp claws.

As predicted, behavior problems (internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and physical weakness) were more strongly related to victimization when children had few friends, had friends who were incapable of fulfilling a protective function (e.g., were physically weak), or were rejected by peers than when children had more friends, had friends capable of defending them, or were better liked by peers.

  abstract      = {Vitamin D is one of the oldest hormones that have been made in the earliest life forms for over 750 million years. Phytoplankton, zooplankton, and most plants and animals that are exposed to sunlight have the capacity to make vitamin D. Vitamin D is critically important for the development, growth, and maintenance of a healthy skeleton from birth until death. The major function of vitamin D is to maintain calcium homeostasis. It accomplishes this by increasing the efficiency of the intestine to absorb dietary calcium. When there is inadequate calcium in the diet to satisfy the body's calcium requirement, vitamin D communicates to the osteoblasts that signal osteoclast precursors to mature and dissolve the calcium stored in the bone. Vitamin D is metabolized in the liver and then in the kidney to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D]. 1,25(OH)2D receptors (VDR) are present not only in the intestine and bone, but in a wide variety of other tissues, including the brain, heart, stomach, pancreas, activated T and B lymphocytes, skin, gonads, etc. 1,25(OH)2D is one of the most potent substances to inhibit proliferation of both normal and hyperproliferative cells and induce them to mature. It is also recognized that a wide variety of tissues, including colon, prostate, breast, and skin have the enzymatic machinery to produce 1,25(OH)2D. 1,25(OH)2D and its analogs have been developed for treating the hyperproliferative disease psoriasis. Vitamin D deficiency is a major unrecognized health problem. Not only does it cause rickets in children, osteomalacia and osteoporosis in adults, but may have long lasting effects. Chronic vitamin D deficiency may have serious adverse consequences, including increased risk of hypertension, multiple sclerosis, cancers of the colon, prostate, breast, and ovary, and type 1 diabetes. There needs to be a better appreciation of the importance of vitamin D for overall health and well being. J. Cell. Biochem. 88: 296-307, 2003. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract      = {G. Evelyn Hutchinson more than a half century ago proposed that one could characterize the ecological niche of a species as an abstract mapping of population dynamics onto an environmental space, the axes of which are abiotic and biotic factors that influence birth and death rates. If a habitat has conditions within a species' niche, a population should persist without immigration from external sources, whereas if conditions are outside the niche, it faces extinction. Analyses of species' niches are essential to understanding controls on species' geographical range limits and how these limits might shift in our rapidly changing world. Recent developments in ecology and evolutionary biology suggest it is time to revisit and refine Hutchinson's niche concept. After reviewing techniques for quantifying niches, I examine subtleties that arise because of impacts species have on their own environments, the density-dependent modulation of how individuals experience environments, and the interplay of dispersal and temporal heterogeneity in determining population persistence. Moreover, the evolutionary record over all time scales reveals a spectrum of rates of change in species' niches, from rapid niche evolution to profound niche conservatism. Substantial challenges revolving around the evolutionary dimension of the Hutchinsonian niche include quantifying the magnitude of evolved intraspecific and clade-level variation in niches and understanding the factors that govern where along the spectrum of potential evolutionary rates any given lineage lies. A growing body of theory provides elements of a conceptual framework for understanding niche conservatism and evolution, paving the way for an evolutionary theory of the niche.},

  abstract      = {Background: Reducing saturated fat reduces serum cholesterol, but effects on other intermediate outcomes may be less clear. Additionally it is unclear whether the energy from saturated fats that are lost in the diet are more helpfully replaced by polyunsaturated fats, monounsaturated fats, carbohydrate or protein. This review is part of a series split from and updating an overarching review. Objectives: To assess the effect of reducing saturated fat intake and replacing it with carbohydrate (CHO), polyunsaturated (PUFA) or monounsaturated fat (MUFA) and/or protein on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity, using all available randomised clinical trials. Search methods: We updated our searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid) and EMBASE (Ovid) on 5 March 2014. We also checked references of included studies and reviews. Selection criteria: Trials fulfilled the following criteria: 1) randomised with appropriate control group; 2) intention to reduce saturated fat intake OR intention to alter dietary fats and achieving a reduction in saturated fat; 3) not multifactorial; 4) adult humans with or without cardiovascular disease (but not acutely ill, pregnant or breastfeeding); 5) intervention at least 24 months; 6) mortality or cardiovascular morbidity data available. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors working independently extracted participant numbers experiencing health outcomes in each arm, and we performed random-effects meta-analyses, meta-regression, subgrouping, sensitivity analyses and funnel plots. Main results: We include 15 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (17 comparisons, Ë59,000 participants), which used a variety of interventions from providing all food to advice on how to reduce saturated fat. The included long-term trials suggested that reducing dietary saturated fat reduced the risk of cardiovascular events by 17% (risk ratio (RR) 0.83; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.96, 13 comparisons, 53,300 participants of whom 8% had a cardiovascular event, IÂ² 65%, GRADE moderate quality of evidence), but effects on all-cause mortality (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.05; 12 trials, 55,858 participants) and cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.12, 12 trials, 53,421 participants) were less clear (both GRADE moderate quality of evidence). There was some evidence that reducing saturated fats reduced the risk of myocardial infarction (fatal and non-fatal, RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.01; 11 trials, 53,167 participants), but evidence for non-fatal myocardial infarction (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.13; 9 trials, 52,834 participants) was unclear and there were no clear effects on stroke (any stroke, RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.12; 8 trials, 50,952 participants). These relationships did not alter with sensitivity analysis. Subgrouping suggested that the reduction in cardiovascular events was seen in studies that primarily replaced saturated fat calories with polyunsaturated fat, and no effects were seen in studies replacing saturated fat with carbohydrate or protein, but effects in studies replacing with monounsaturated fats were unclear (as we located only one small trial). Subgrouping and meta-regression suggested that the degree of reduction in cardiovascular events was related to the degree of reduction of serum total cholesterol, and there were suggestions of greater protection with greater saturated fat reduction or greater increase in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats. There was no evidence of harmful effects of reducing saturated fat intakes on cancer mortality, cancer diagnoses or blood pressure, while there was some evidence of improvements in weight and BMI. Authors' conclusions: The findings of this updated review are suggestive of a small but potentially important reduction in cardiovascular risk on reduction of saturated fat intake. Replacing the energy from saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat appears to be a useful strategy, and replacement with carbohydrate appears less useful, but effects of replacement with monounsaturated fat were unclear due to inclusion of only one small trial. This effect did not appear to alter by study duration, sex or baseline level of cardiovascular risk. Lifestyle advice to all those at risk of cardiovascular disease and to lower risk population groups should continue to include permanent reduction of dietary saturated fat and partial replacement by unsaturated fats. The ideal type of unsaturated fat is unclear.},

  text          = {Botulism Outbreak Associated With Eating Fermented Food ---Alaska, 2001 On January 18, 2001, the Alaska Division of Public Health was informed by a local physician of a possible botulism outbreak in a southwest Alaska village. This report summarizes the findings of the outbreak investigation, which linked disease to eating fermented food, and describes a new botulism prevention program in Alaska. A case of foodborne botulism was defined as a clinically compatible illness in a village resident with laboratory confirmation of botulism or a history of eating the same food as a laboratory-confirmed case; 14 persons in the village had eaten fermented beaver tail and paw on January 17. Approximately 20 hours later, three of the 14 had symptoms suggestive of botulism, including dry mouth, blurry vision, and general weakness. Two patients developed respiratory failure and required intubation and mechanical ventilation. One of the two intubated patients suffered cardiac arrest and underwent successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Approximately 6 hours after the onset of symptoms, the three patients received types A/B and E botulism antitoxin. They subsequently were evacuated to an intensive care unit (ICU) in Anchorage. Two patients recovered without further complication. The third required tracheostomy tube placement and mechanical ventilation for 1 month; this patient had been hospitalized with botulism in 1997. Of the other 11 exposed persons, four reported minor symptoms compatible with botulism, including dry mouth and nausea, and were admitted to a hospital for overnight observation. One was hospitalized for 10 days with persistent ileus. The remaining seven exposed persons were held for observation for 48 hours. Clinical specimens from the 14 exposed persons were tested for botulinum toxin at CDC. Type E toxin was detected in serum specimens from two of the ICU patients and in stool from the third. Although they displayed minor symptoms, the other 11 persons had no toxin found in specimens and were not considered laboratory-confirmed cases. Type E toxin also was detected in three beaver paws tested from the implicated meal. Beaver is hunted in southwest Alaska, and certain parts often are fermented and eaten later. In this outbreak, the tail and paws had been wrapped in a paper rice sack and stored for up to 3 months in the entry of a patient's house. Some of the beaver tail and paw had been added to the sack as recently as 1 week before it was eaten.

Arctic Investigations Program; Foodborne and Diarrheal Diseases Br, Div of Bacterial and Mycotic Diseases, National Center for Infectious Diseases; and EIS officers, CDC. Editorial Note: This report illustrates how the use of nontraditional fermentation methods is associated with foodborne botulism in Alaska. Botulism results from eating preformed toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum. Botulism begins with cranial nerve paralysis, including diplopia, dilated and fixed pupils, dysarthria, dysphagia, and dry throat. Botulism intoxication can result in death, which most often is caused by respiratory failure. The latent period is typically 12--36 hours but can range from 6 hours to 10 days (1). C. botulinum and closely related organisms produce toxins designated as types A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Human botulism is most commonly caused by types A, B, and E. Type E is associated with foods of marine or freshwater origin. Alaska's foodborne botulism rates exceed those in any other state and are among the highest in the world (1). During 1950--2000, Alaska recorded 226 cases of foodborne botulism from 114 outbreaks. All patients were Alaska Natives, and all cases with known causes were associated with eating fermented foods (1,2). Approximately 27% of U.S. foodborne botulism cases occur in Alaska. In traditional fermentation, food is kept in a grass-lined hole in the ground or a wooden barrel sunken into the ground or is placed in a shady area above ground for several weeks to months. Since the 1970s, however, plastic or glass containers have been used and fermentation has been done above ground or indoors. The anaerobic condition of sealed containers and warmer temperatures make fermentation more rapid and production of botulism toxin more likely (3--5). These nontraditional methods have been associated with increased botulism rates in Alaska during 1970--1989 (Figure 1) (4,5). Although a plastic container was not used in this outbreak, the beaver tail and paw were fermented in a closed rice sack and stored in a warm area. Early diagnosis and antitoxin treatment have contributed to the decline of the case-fatality rate from approximately 31% during 1950--1959 to no deaths in Alaska since 1994 (1). However, Alaska continues to have high foodborne botulism rates because fermented foods are part of Alaska Native culture. In a 1999 survey, 107 (77%) of 140 Alaska Natives reported having eaten fermented foods at least once in their lifetime (3). In 1998, the Bristol Bay Area Health Corporation, a health-care delivery organization operated by Alaska Natives in southwest Alaska, collaborated with CDC's Arctic Investigations Program to design a community-based botulism prevention strategy, including an education video entitled, "A Helping Hand: Keeping Your Family Safe From Botulism." It features Alaska Native elders and botulism survivors discussing the risks of eating improperly fermented foods and recommends returning to traditional methods. The video also suggests boiling fermented foods for 10 minutes to destroy botulinum toxin. Both an English and an Alaska Native language version of the video were produced and distributed to all village clinics and schools in the Bristol Bay region.

The number of children diagnosed with ASD has grown exponentially over the last four decades and is now estimated to affect â¼1.5% of children. Although ASD is currently diagnosed and treated based solely on psychometric tools, a biochemical view applicable to at least a subset of ASD cases is emerging. Abnormalities in folate-dependent one carbon metabolism and transsulfuration pathways can summarize a large number of observations of genetic and environmental effects that increase ASD predisposition. However, these complex, highly interconnected pathways require more advanced statistical models than the typical univariate models presented in the literature. Therefore, we developed multivariate statistical models that classify participants based on their neurological status and predict adaptive behavior in ASD. We emphasize that these models are cross-validated, helping to ensure that the results will generalize to new samples. The models developed herein have much stronger predictability than any existing approaches from the scientific literature.},

  abstract      = {SummaryBackground Oral immunotherapy has attracted much interest as a potential treatment for food allergy, yet little is known about its long-term effects. We aimed to assess long-term outcomes in participants who completed a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of combined probiotic and peanut oral immunotherapy (PPOIT), which was previously shown to induce desensitisation and 2-week sustained unresponsiveness. Methods All participants who completed the \{PPOIT\} randomised trial were eligible to participate in this follow-up study 4 years after treatment cessation. Peanut intake and adverse reactions to peanut in the 4 years after treatment cessation were systematically documented with a structured questionnaire administered by allergy nurses. Additionally, participants were invited to undergo peanut skin prick tests, measurement of peanut sIgE and sIgG4 concentrations, and double-blind placebo-controlled peanut challenge to assess 8-week sustained unresponsiveness. Findings 48 (86%) of 56 eligible participants were enrolled in the follow-up study. Mean time since stopping treatment was 4Â·2 years in both \{PPOIT\} (SD 0Â·6) and placebo (SD 0Â·7) participants. Participants from the \{PPOIT\} group were significantly more likely than those from the placebo group to have continued eating peanut (16 [67%] of 24 vs one [4%] of 24; absolute difference 63% [95% \{CI\} 42â83], p=0Â·001; number needed to treat 1Â·6 [95% \{CI\} 1Â·2â2Â·4]). Four PPOIT-treated participants and six placebo participants reported allergic reactions to peanut after intentional or accidental intake since stopping treatment, but none had anaphylaxis. PPOIT-treated participants had smaller wheals in peanut skin prick test (mean 8Â·1 mm [SD 7Â·7] vs 13Â·3 mm [7Â·6]; absolute difference â5Â·2 mm [95% \{CI\} â10Â·3 to 0Â·0]; age-adjusted and sex-adjusted p=0Â·035) and significantly higher peanut sIgG4:sIgE ratios than placebo participants (geometric mean 67Â·3 [95% \{CI\} 10Â·3â440Â·0] vs 5Â·2 [1Â·2â21Â·8]; p=0Â·031). Seven (58%) of 12 participants from the \{PPOIT\} group attained 8-week sustained unresponsiveness, compared with one (7%) of 15 participants from the placebo group (absolute difference 52% [95% \{CI\} 21â82), p=0Â·012; number needed to treat 1Â·9 [95% \{CI\} 1Â·2â4Â·8]). Interpretation \{PPOIT\} provides long-lasting clinical benefit and persistent suppression of the allergic immune response to peanut.

We used high-resolution GPS and inertial technology to record 1,119 high-speed chases of all members of a pack of six adult African wild dogs in northern Botswana. Dogs performed multiple short, high-speed, mostly unsuccessful chases to capture prey, while cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) undertook even shorter, higher-speed hunts. We used an energy balance model to show that the energy return from group hunting and feeding substantially outweighs the cost of multiple short chases, which indicates that African wild dogs are more energetically robust than previously believed. Comparison with cheetah illustrates the trade-off between sheer athleticism and high individual kill rate characteristic of cheetahs, and the energetic robustness of frequent opportunistic group hunting and feeding by African wild dogs.},

  abstract      = {A catastrophic extinction occurred at the end of the Permian Period. However, baseline extinction rates appear to have been elevated even before the final catastrophe, suggesting sustained environmental degradation. For terrestrial vertebrates during the Late Permian, the combination of a drop in atmospheric oxygen plus climate warming would have induced hypoxic stress and consequently compressed altitudinal ranges to near sea level. Our simulations suggest that the magnitude of altitudinal compression would have forced extinctions by reducing habitat diversity, fragmenting and isolating populations, and inducing a species-area effect. It also might have delayed ecosystem recovery after the mass extinction.},

  abstract      = {Sperm quality plays an important role in vertebrates in determining which male has the advantage when two or more males compete to fertilize a female's ova [1, 2]. In insects, however, the importance of sperm quality has never been considered, despite sperm competition being widespread and well studied in this group [3, 4]. We tested the hypothesis that sperm viability, measured as the proportion of live sperm, covaried with the intensity of sperm competition in insects. In a pairwise comparison of seven closely related species pairs, each comprising a monandrous and a polyandrous species (i.e., with and without sperm competition, respectively), we found that in all cases the polyandrous species had a higher proportion of live sperm in their sperm stores. The distribution of the percentage of live sperm showed considerable inter- and intraspecific variation, suggesting that, all else being equal, males will vary in their ability to fertilize ova on the basis of sperm viability alone. Our results suggest that sperm viability is one of a suite of male adaptations to sperm competition in insects.},

The presence of C. botulinum in European wild freshwater fish and roe was demonstrated for the first time by isolation of the organism from PCR-positive samples. Five percent of 214 vacuum-packed and 3% of 123 air-packed fishery product samples examined at retail level were positive for the botulinum neurotoxin type E gene. A contamination level of 10% in vacuum-packed hot-smoked whitefish was detected.

In the obligate accommodationâtransportation mutualism between walking corals and sipunculans, however, an unusual saltatory symbiont shift was discovered. In shallow waters of southern Japan, an undescribed hermit crab species was found living in corallums of solitary scleractinian corals of the genera Heterocyathus and Heteropsammia, replacing the usual sipunculan symbiont. We described the hermit crab as a new species Diogenes heteropsammicola (Decapoda, Anomura, Diogenidae), and explored its association with the walking corals. This hermit crab species obligately inhabits the coiled cavity of the corals, and was easily distinguished from other congeneric species by the exceedingly slender chelipeds and ambulatory legs, and the symmetrical telson. Observations of behavior in aquaria showed that the new hermit crab, like the sipunculan, carries the host coral and prevents the coral from being buried. This is an interesting case in which an organism phylogenetically distant from Sipuncula takes over the symbiotic role in association with a walking coral. The hermit crab species is unique in that its lodging is a living solitary coral that grows with the hermit crab in an accommodationâtransportation mutualism.},

The severity of frostbite injuries can now be assessed with triple phase bone scanning, allowing early prediction of likely subsequent tissue loss. Early hyperbaric oxygen therapy appears to improve outcome and the use of intravenous drugs such as synthetic prostaglandin analogues infusions and tissue plasminogen activator have been shown to reduce amputation rates. In non-freezing cold injuries the early administration of analgesia, the avoidance of secondary exposure, and the use of infrared thermography to assess the injuries are among newer approaches being introduced.},

Usnic acid is uniquely found in lichens, and is especially abundant in genera such as Alectoria, Cladonia, Usnea, Lecanora, Ramalina and Evernia. Many lichens and extracts containing usnic acid have been utilized for medicinal, perfumery, cosmetic as well as ecological applications. Usnic acid as a pure substance has been formulated in creams, toothpaste, mouthwash, deodorants and sunscreen products, in some cases as an active principle, in others as a preservative. In addition to antimicrobial activity against human and plant pathogens, usnic acid has been shown to exhibit antiviral, antiprotozoal, antiproliferative, anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity. Ecological effects, such as antigrowth, antiherbivore and anti-insect properties, have also been demonstrated. A difference in biological activity has in some cases been observed between the two enantiomeric forms of usnic acid. Recently health food supplements containing usnic acid have been promoted for use in weight reduction, with little scientific support. The emphasis of the current review is on the chemistry and biological activity of usnic acid and its derivatives in addition to rational and ecologically acceptable methods for provision of this natural compound on a large scale. },

However, the mechanism and evolutionary significance of this variation have proved more elusive, and continue to excite the interest of investigators from different disciplines. This genetically determined trait differs in frequency worldwide and is due to cis-acting polymorphism of regulation of lactase gene expression. A single nucleotide polymorphism located 13.9Â kb upstream from the lactase gene (C-13910Â >Â T) was proposed to be the cause, and the â13910*T allele, which is widespread in Europe was found to be located on a very extended haplotype of 500Â kb or more. The long region of haplotype conservation reflects a recent origin, and this, together with high frequencies, is evidence of positive selection, but also means that â13910*T might be an associated marker, rather than being causal of lactase persistence itself. Doubt about function was increased when it was shown that the original SNP did not account for lactase persistence in most African populations. However, the recent discovery that there are several other SNPs associated with lactase persistence in close proximity (within 100Â bp), and that they all reside in a piece of sequence that has enhancer function in vitro, does suggest that they may each be functional, and their occurrence on different haplotype backgrounds shows that several independent mutations led to lactase persistence. Here we provide access to a database of worldwide distributions of lactase persistence and of the C-13910*T allele, as well as reviewing lactase molecular and population genetics and the role of selection in determining present day distributions of the lactase persistence phenotype.},

  abstract      = {AbstractObjective Little is known about human postprandial increase of energy expenditure and satiety-associated hormones in relation to both meal frequency and macronutrient composition. Design Randomized cross-over study with four conditions for each participant. Methods Seven men and seven women (mean age 23 Â± 1.5 years) were randomly assigned to the order of intake of a 750 kcal drink with the same protein content while having either 20 energy-percent (E%) or 55 E% from carbohydrates and the remaining energy from fat. Participants were also randomized to consume the drinks as one large beverage or as five 150 kcal portions every 30 min, starting in the fasting state in the morning. Energy expenditure (EE) was determined every 30 min by indirect calorimetry. Hormonal responses and suppression of hunger (by visual-analogue scales) were also studied. A p &lt; 0.013 was considered statistically significant following Bonferroni-correction. Results The area under the curve (AUC) for \{EE\} was higher during the 2.5 h after the high-carbohydrate drinks (p = 0.005 by Wilcoxon) and also after ingesting one drink compared with five (p = 0.004). \{AUC\} for serum active GLP-1 was higher after single drinks compared with five beverages (p = 0.002). Although GLP-1 levels remained particularly high at the end of the test during the low-carbohydrate meals, the \{AUC\} did not differ compared with the high-carbohydrate occasions (low-carbohydrate: 58.9 Â± 18 pg/ml/h, high-carbohydrate: 45.2 Â± 16 pg/ml/h, p = 0.028). Hunger sensations were suppressed more after single beverages compared with five small drinks (p = 0.009). Conclusions We found higher \{EE\} during 2.5 h following one large drink compared with five smaller beverages. Since hunger was also suppressed more efficiently, and serum GLP-1 levels were higher after one compared with five smaller drinks, our findings do not support nibbling to avoid hunger or to keep up \{EE\} from morning to noon. },

  abstract      = {he use of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) for physical and mental problems has increased significantly in the US over the past two decades, and depression is one of the leading indications for the use of CAM. This article reviews some of the lesser-known natural products with potential psychiatric applications that are starting to emerge with some scientific and clinical evidence and may constitute a next wave of natural antidepressants: Rhodiola rosea, chromium, 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) and inositol. Background information, efficacy data, proposed mechanisms of action, recommended doses, side effects, and precautions are reviewed. We found some encouraging data for the use of these natural products in specific populations of depressed patients. R. rosea is an adaptogen plant that can be especially helpful in treating asthenic or lethargic depression, and may be combined with conventional antidepressants to alleviate some of their common side effects. Chromium has a beneficial effect on eating-related atypical symptoms of depression, and may be a valuable agent in treating atypical depression and seasonal affective disorder. Inositol may be useful in the treatment of bipolar depression when combined with mood stabilizers. Evidence for the clinical efficacy of 5-HTP is also promising but still preliminary. Although more well-designed and larger controlled studies are needed before any substantive conclusions can be drawn, the available evidence is compelling and these natural products deserve further investigation as a possibly significant addition to the antidepressant armamentarium.},

  abstract      = {Here we present an analytical technique for the measurement and evaluation of changes in chronologically sequenced assemblages. To illustrate the method, we studied the cultural evolution of European cooking as revealed in seven cook books dispersed over the past 800 years. We investigated if changes in the set of commonly used ingredients were mainly gradual or subject to fashion fluctuations. Applying our method to the data from the cook books revealed that overall, there is a clear continuity in cooking over the ages â cooking is knowledge that is passed down through generations, not something (re-)invented by each generation on its own. Looking at three main categories of ingredients separately (spices, animal products and vegetables), however, disclosed that all ingredients do not change according to the same pattern. While choice of animal products was very conservative, changing completely sequentially, changes in the choices of spices, but also of vegetables, were more unbounded. We hypothesize that this may be due a combination of fashion fluctuations and changes in availability due to contact with the Americas during our study time period. The presented method is also usable on other assemblage type data, and can thus be of utility for analyzing sequential archaeological data from the same area or other similarly organized material.},

We conducted a phase I dose escalation study to determine the safety and antiviral activity of hypericin in patients with chronic HCV infection. The first 12 patients received an 8-week course of 0.05 mg of hypericin per kg of body weight orally once a day; 7 patients received an 8-week course of 0.10 mg/kg orally once a day. At the end of the 8-week period of treatment, no subject had a change of plasma HCV RNA level of more than 1.0 log10. Five of 12 subjects receiving the 0.05-mg/kg/day dosing schedule and 6 of 7 subjects receiving the 0.10-mg/kg/day dosing schedule developed phototoxic reactions. No other serious adverse events associated with hypericin use occurred. The pharmacokinetic data revealed a long elimination half-life (mean values of 36.1 and 33.8 h, respectively, for the doses of 0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg) and mean area under the curve determinations of 1.5 and 3.1 {micro}g/ml x hr, respectively. In sum, hypericin given orally in doses of 0.05 and 0.10 mg/kg/d caused considerable phototoxicity and had no detectable anti-HCV activity in patients with chronic HCV infection. },

These toxins, named the Î±-nemertides, were discovered in the epidermal mucus of Lineus longissimus, the âbootlace wormâ known as the longest animal on earth. The most abundant peptide, the 31-residue longÂ Î±-1, was isolated, synthesized, and its 3D NMR structure determined. Transcriptome analysis including 17 species revealed eight Î±-nemertides, mainly distributed in the genus Lineus. Î±-1 caused paralysis and death in green crabs (Carcinus maenas) at 1âÂµg/kg (~300 pmol/kg). It showed profound effect on invertebrate voltage-gated sodium channels (e.g. Blattella germanica Nav1) at low nanomolar concentrations. Strong selectivity for insect over human sodium channels indicates that Î±-nemertides can be promising candidates for development of bioinsecticidal agents.},

  abstract      = {Medically induced amenorrhea can be achieved through alterations in the normal regulatory hormones via the adoption of
a therapeutic agent, which prevents menstrual flow. Spaceflight-related advantages for medically induced amenorrhea differ
according to the time point in the astronaut’s training schedule. Pregnancy is contraindicated for many pre-flight training activities
as well as spaceflight, therefore effective contraception is essential. In addition, the practicalities of menstruating during pre-flight
training or spaceflight can be challenging. During long-duration missions, female astronauts have often continuously taken the
combined oral contraceptive pill to induce amenorrhea. Long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) are safe and reliable
methods used to medically induce amenorrhea terrestrially but as of yet, not extensively used by female astronauts. If LARCs were
used, daily compliance with an oral pill is not required and no upmass or trash would need disposal. Military studies have shown
that high proportions of female personnel desire amenorrhea during deployment; better education has been recommended at
recruitment to improve uptake and autonomous decision-making. Astronauts are exposed to similar austere conditions as military
personnel and parallels can be drawn with these results. Offering female astronauts up-to-date, evidence-based, comprehensive
education, in view of the environment in which they work, would empower them to make informed decisions regarding menstrual
suppression while respecting their autonomy.},

examined objective indices of performance, and self-reported mood, head-

cross-over design with counterbalancing was employed in which all subjects
participated in four experimental conditions involving the ingestion of place-
bo or caffeine 3 times daily for 6 days followed by a 7th (challenge) day of
placebo or caffeine ingestion. No evidence was found that caffeine improved
performance, either in the context of acute or habitual use. On the contrary,
performance was found to be significantly impaired when caffeine was with-
drawn abruptly following habitual use. Participants reported feeling more
alert and less tired following acute ingestion of caffeine, but feeling less alert in
conjunction with chronic exposure to the drug. In addition, caffeine withdraw-
al was associated with reported increasses in frequency and severity of head-
ache, and with reports of sleeping longer and more soundly.

Thisprinciple of trichromacy is in need of reexamination in view of molecular genetics results suggesting that a substantial percentage of women possess more than three classes of retinal photopigments. At issue is the question of whether four-photopigment retinas necessarily yield trichromatic color perception. In the present paper, we review results and theory underlying the accepted photoreceptor-based model of trichromacy. A review of the psychological literature shows that gender-linked differences in color perception warrant further investigation of retinal photopigment classes and color perception relations. We use genetic analyses to examine an important position in the gene sequence, and we empirically assess and compare the color perception of individuals possessing more than three retinal photopigment genes with those possessing fewer retinal photopigment genes. Women with four-photopigment genotypes are found to perceive significantly more chromatic appearances in comparison with either male or female trichromat controls. We provide a rationale for this previously undetected finding and discuss implications for theories of color perception and gender differences in color behavior.},

The assessment and management of non-point sources of microbial pollution, in particular, is an issue of great interest. A representative watershed scale water quality model would be an invaluable tool in addressing microbial pollution issues. The objective of this review is to present and evaluate current approaches to modeling the microbial quality of surface waters in rural watersheds. A complete watershed scale microbial water quality model includes subroutines which (i) characterize the production and distribution of waste and associated microorganisms, (ii) simulate the transport of microorganisms from the land surface to receiving streams, and (iii) route microorganisms through stream networks. Current watershed scale models only account for microbial transport to surface waters through overland flow and ignore subsurface transport. The movement of microorganisms on the soil surface is predicted using simple empirical equations or by assuming that microorganism transport is only associated with sediment erosion. However, several studies have indicated that the assumption that microorganism transport is directly linked with sediment transport may not be valid. The simulation of microorganism survival and transport in receiving streams is complicated by sediment/microorganism interactions. More research is needed to be able to quantitatively assess and model microbial processes in alluvial streams.},

We hypothesized that there is a homeostatic regulation of body weight. We demonstrate that increased loading of rodents, achieved using capsules with different weights implanted in the abdomen or s.c. on the back, reversibly decreases the biological body weight via reduced food intake. Importantly, loading relieves diet-induced obesity and improves glucose tolerance. The identified homeostat for body weight regulates body fat mass independently of fat-derived leptin, revealing two independent negative feedback systems for fat mass regulation. It is known that osteocytes can sense changes in bone strain. In this study, the body weight-reducing effect of increased loading was lost in mice depleted of osteocytes. We propose that increased body weight activates a sensor dependent on osteocytes of the weight-bearing bones. This induces an afferent signal, which reduces body weight. These findings demonstrate a leptin-independent body weight homeostat ({\textquotedblleft}gravitostat{\textquotedblright}) that regulates fat mass.},

Aim
To investigate the changes in prevalence and incidence of pharmacologically and non-pharmacologically treated diabetes in Sweden during 2005 to 2013.

Methods
We obtained data on gender, date of birth and pharmacologically and non-pharmacologically treated diabetes from national registers for all Swedish residents.

Results
During the study period a total of 240 871 new cases of pharmacologically treated diabetes was found. The age-standardized incidence during the follow-up was 4.34 and 3.16 per 1000 individuals in men and women, respectively. A decreasing time trend in incidence for men of 0.6% per year (0.994, 95% CI 0.989â0.999) and for women of 0.7% per year (0.993, 95% CI 0.986â0.999) was observed. The age-standardized prevalence increased from 41.9 and 29.9 per 1000 in 2005/2006 to 50.8 and 34.6 in 2012/2013 in men and women, respectively. This corresponds to an annually increasing time trend for both men (1.024, 95% CI 1.022â1.027) and women (1.019, 95% CI 1.016â1.021). The total age-standardized prevalence of pharmacologically and non-pharmacologically treated diabetes (2012) was 46.9 per 1000 (55.6 for men and 38.8 for women). This corresponds to an annually increasing time trend (2010â2012) for both men (1.017, 95% CI 1.013â1.021) and women (1.012, 95% CI 1.008â1.016).

Conclusions
The prevalence of pharmacologically treated diabetes increased moderately during 8Â years of follow-up, while the incidence decreased modestly. This is in contrast to the results reported by most other studies. The total prevalence of diabetes (both pharmacologically and non-pharmacologically treated) in Sweden is relatively low, from a global viewpoint.

Using fMRI in humans and a simulation of London (UK), here we show that, specifically when new streets are entered during navigation of the city, right posterior hippocampal activity indexes the change in the number of local topological connections available for future travel and right anterior hippocampal activity reflects global properties of the street entered. When forced detours require re-planning of the route to the goal, bilateral inferior lateral prefrontal activity scales with the planning demands of a breadth-first search of future paths. These results help shape models of how hippocampal and prefrontal regions support navigation, planning and future simulation.},

Does happiness rise indefinitely with income, or is there a point at which higher incomes no longer lead to greater well-being? We examine this question using data from the Gallup World Poll, a representative sample of over 1.7 million individuals worldwide. Controlling for demographic factors, we use spline regression models to statistically identify points of âincome satiationâ. Globally, we find that satiation occurs at $95,000 for life evaluation and $60,000 to $75,000 for emotional well-being. However, there is substantial variation across world regions, with satiation occurring later in wealthier regions. We also find that in certain parts of the world, incomes beyond satiation are associated with lower life evaluations. These findings on income and happiness have practical and theoretical significance at the individual, institutional and national levels. They point to a degree of happiness adaptation 4,5 and that money influences happiness through the fulfilment of both needs and increasing material desires 6 .},

Commercially available cranberry juice cocktail also significantly reduced (P < 0.01) bacterial populations in the bladder, as did the hydrophilic fraction of cranberry juice (P < 0.05). Quinic, malic, shikimic, and citric acid, the preponderant organic acids in cranberry juice, were tested in combination and individually.

The other tested combinations of the organic acids, and the acids administered singly, did not have any effect in the UTI model. Apparently, the antibacterial effect of the organic acids from cranberry juice on UTI can be obtained by administering a combination of malic acid and either citric or quinic acid.

  abstract      = {Glycogen is the storage form of carbohydrates in mammals. In humans the majority of glycogen is stored in skeletal muscles (â¼500âg) and the liver (â¼100âg). Food is supplied in larger meals, but the blood glucose concentration has to be kept within narrow limits to survive and stay healthy. Therefore, the body has to cope with periods of excess carbohydrates and periods without supplementation. Healthy persons remove blood glucose rapidly when glucose is in excess, but insulin-stimulated glucose disposal is reduced in insulin resistant and type 2 diabetic subjects. During a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, 70â90% of glucose disposal will be stored as muscle glycogen in healthy subjects. The glycogen stores in skeletal muscles are limited because an efficient feedback-mediated inhibition of glycogen synthase prevents accumulation. De novo lipid synthesis can contribute to glucose disposal when glycogen stores are filled. Exercise physiologists normally consider glycogenâs main function as energy substrate. Glycogen is the main energy substrate during exercise intensity above 70% of maximal oxygen uptake (Vo2maxâ¡) and fatigue develops when the glycogen stores are depleted in the active muscles. After exercise, the rate of glycogen synthesis is increased to replete glycogen stores, and blood glucose is the substrate. Indeed insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis is elevated after exercise, which, from an evolutional point of view, will favor glycogen repletion and preparation for new âfight or flightâ events. In the modern society, the reduced glycogen stores in skeletal muscles after exercise allows carbohydrates to be stored as muscle glycogen and prevents that glucose is channeled to de novo lipid synthesis, which over time will causes ectopic fat accumulation and insulin resistance. The reduction of skeletal muscle glycogen after exercise allows a healthy storage of carbohydrates after meals and prevents development of type 2 diabetes.},

  abstract      = {The “flipped classroom” is a learning model in which content attainment is shifted forward to outside of class, then followed by instructor-facilitated concept application activities in class. Current studies on the flipped model are limited. Our goal was to provide quantitative and controlled data about the effectiveness of this model. Using a quasi-experimental design, we compared an active nonflipped classroom with an active flipped classroom, both using the 5-E learning cycle, in an effort to vary only the role of the instructor and control for as many of the other potentially influential variables as possible. Results showed that both low-level and deep conceptual learning were equivalent between the conditions. Attitudinal data revealed equal student satisfaction with the course. Interestingly, both treatments ranked their contact time with the instructor as more influential to their learning than what they did at home. We conclude that the flipped classroom does not result in higher learning gains or better attitudes compared with the nonflipped classroom when both utilize an active-learning, constructivist approach and propose that learning gains in either condition are most likely a result of the active-learning style of instruction rather than the order in which the instructor participated in the learning process.},

  abstract      = {In recent years, neonicotinoid insecticides have been the fastest growing class of insecticides in modern crop protection, with widespread use against a broad spectrum of sucking and certain chewing pests. As potent agonists, they act selectively on insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), their molecular target site. The discovery of neonicotinoids can be considered as a milestone in insecticide research and greatly facilitates the understanding of functional properties of the insect nAChRs. In this context, the crystal structure of the acetylcholine-binding proteins provides the theoretical foundation for designing homology models of the corresponding receptor ligand binding domains within the nAChRs, a useful basis for virtual screening of chemical libraries and rational design of novel insecticides acting on these practically relevant channels. Because of the relatively low risk for nontarget organisms and the environment, the high target specificity of neonicotinoid insecticides, and their versatility in application methods, this important class has to be maintained globally for integrated pest management strategies and insect resistance management programs. Innovative concepts for life-cycle management, jointly with the introduction of generic products, have made neonicotinoids the most important chemical class for the insecticide market.

In this study, we aimed to elucidate the mechanisms behind this protective effect by assessing the cell-autonomous response of primary adipocytes to CA treatment. Primary murine adipocytes were treated with CA and thermogenic and metabolic responses were assessed after both acute and chronic treatments. Human adipose stem cells were differentiated and treated with CA to assess whether the CA-mediated signaling is conserved in humans. CA significantly activated PKA signaling, increased expression levels of thermogenic genes and induced phosphorylation of HSL and PLIN1 in murine primary adipocytes. Inhibition of PKA or p38 MAPK enzymatic activity markedly inhibited the CA-induced thermogenic response. In addition, chronic CA treatment regulates metabolic reprogramming, which was partially diminished in FGF21KO adipocytes. Importantly, both acute and chronic effects of CA were observed in human adipose stem cells isolated from multiple donors of different ethnicities and ages and with a variety of body mass indexes (BMI). CA activates thermogenic and metabolic responses in mouse and human primary subcutaneous adipocytes in a cell-autonomous manner, giving a mechanistic explanation for the anti-obesity effects of CA observed previously and further supporting its potential metabolic benefits on humans. Given the wide usage of cinnamon in the food industry, the notion that this popular food additive, instead of a drug, may activate thermogenesis, could ultimately lead to therapeutic strategies against obesity that are much better adhered to by participants.},

premenstrual mood disturbance with oral contraceptive pill use.
STUDY DESIGN: Predictors of the deleterious and beneficial effects of oral contraceptive pill use on
premenstrual mood were analyzed with the use of logistic regression in a nested case-control study within
a community-based cohort of 976 premenopausal women in Massachusetts.
RESULTS: Of 658 women who were using oral contraceptive pills, 16.3% of the women reported oral
contraceptive pill-related premenstrual mood deterioration, and 12.3% of the women reported premenstrual
mood improvement. In adjusted models, previous depression was the only significant predictor of mood
deterioration (odds ratio, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.8); early-onset premenstrual mood disturbance and dysmenorrhea
were significant predictors of oral contraceptive pill-related mood improvement (odds ratio, 3.1 [95% CI,
1.9-5.2] and odds ratio, 2.3 [95% CI, 1.4-3.9], respectively).
CONCLUSION: Oral contraceptive pills do not influence premenstrual mood in most women. Premenstrual
mood is most likely to deteriorate in women with a history of depression and to improve in women with
early-onset premenstrual mood disturbance or dysmenorrhea. (Am J Obstet Gynecol 2003;189:1523-30.)

We asked how the lateralized brain handles this basic problem of spatial and temporal coordination. We show that the brain consistently appoints one of the hands as prime actor while the other assists, but the choice of acting hand is flexible. When study participants control a cursor by manipulating a tool held freely between the hands, the left hand becomes prime actor if the cursor moves directionally with the left-hand forces, whereas the right hand primarily acts if it moves with the opposing right-hand forces. In neurophysiological (electromyography, transcranial magnetic brain stimulation) and functional magnetic resonance brain imaging experiments we demonstrate that changes in hand assignment parallels a midline shift of lateralized activity in distal hand muscles, corticospinal pathways, and primary sensorimotor and cerebellar cortical areas. We conclude that the two hands can readily exchange roles as dominant actor in bimanual tasks. Spatial relationships between hand forces and goal motions determine hand assignments rather than habitual handedness. Finally, flexible role assignment of the hands is manifest at multiple levels of the motor system, from cortical regions all the way down to particular muscles.},

Despite evidence of memory decreases during pharmacological GC treatment, and correlations between memory and cortisol levels in certain disease conditions, it remains unclear whether exposure to the endogenous GC cortisol at levels seen during physical and psychological stress in humans can inhibit memory performance in otherwise healthy individuals. Methods Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled comparison of 2 fixed oral doses of cortisol (40 mg/d and 160 mg/d using split doses to approximate circadian rhythm) given for 4 days to matched groups of healthy subjects (n=51). Lower-dose treatment approximated cortisol exposure during mild stress, whereas the higher dose approximated cortisol exposure during major stress. Cognitive testing and plasma sampling were done at baseline, after 1 and 4 days of treatment, and after a 6-day washout period, hypothesizing dose-dependent decreases in verbal declarative memory. Results Cortisol treatment at the higher dose produced reversible decreases in verbal declarative memory without effects on nonverbal memory, sustained or selective attention, or executive function. A significant interaction between time and treatment condition for paragraph recall was explained by treatment-induced differences in performance after 4 treatment days, with lower immediate and delayed recall performance during higher-dose cortisol treatment compared with lower-dose treatment and placebo. Conclusions Several days of exposure to cortisol at doses and plasma concentrations associated with physical and psychological stress in humans can?similar to pharmacological GC treatment?reversibly decrease specific elements of memory performance in otherwise healthy individuals.},

Energy expenditure was maintained at about 3,600 kcal/day.

Body weight losses averaged 6.0 and 5.2 kg (8.1 and 7.2% of their initial weights) for groups I and II, respectively. Some hypohydration occurred during the first days of restriction, but part of this water was regained during rehabilitation.

Under the conditions of this study, the caloric deficit was accounted for primarily through catabolism of fat stores, with body protein contributing 4 to 5%. Due to the lower caloric value of protein and its associated water, this protein loss accounted for approximately one-fourth of the weight loss observed. Negative nitrogen balances averaged 7.1 and 6.5 g/man per day, and no improvement in nitrogen balances was observed during the study, which would indicate that this may be the best balance attainable under these conditions.

Sodium losses amounted to only approximately 5 g/man for all of the subjects during 10 days of restriction, but potassium losses were large, namely, 19 and 21 g/man for groups I and II.},

  abstract      = {Ecosystem engineers are organisms that directly or indirectly modulate the availability of resources to other species, by causing physical state changes in biotic or abiotic materials. In so doing they modify, maintain and create habitats. Autogenic engineers (e.g. corals, or trees) change the environment via their own physical structures (i.e. their living and dead tissues). Allogenic engineers (e.g. woodpeckers, beavers) change the environment by transforming living or non-living materials from one physical state to another, via mechanical or other means. The direct provision of resources to other species, in the form of living or dead tissues is not engineering. Organisms act as engineers when they modulate the supply of a resource or resources other than themselves. We recognise and define five types of engineering and provide examples. Humans are allogenic engineers par excellence, and also mimic the behaviour of autogenic engineers, for example by constructing glasshouses. We explore related concepts including the notions of extended phenotypes and keystone species. Some (but not all) products of ecosystem engineering are extended phenotypes. Many (perhaps most) impacts of keystone species include not only trophic effects, but also engineers and engineering. Engineers differ in their impacts. The biggest effects are attributable to species with large per capita impacts, living at high densities, over large areas for a long time, giving rise to structures that persist for millennia and that modulate many resource flows (e.g. mima mounds created by fossorial rodents). The ephemeral nests constructed by small, passerine birds lie at the opposite end of this continuum. We provide a tentative research agenda for an exploration of the phenomenon of organisms as ecosystem engineers, and suggest that all habitats on earth support, and are influenced by, ecosystem engineers.},

In it, we describe the results of a census, and our estimation of age structure, survivorship, mean age of women at childbearing, number of live children, total population size and density, and rate of change since 1967. We show that relevant measures fit closely the stable population model North 6 chosen by Dyson to represent Hadza demography in the 1960s.We compare aspects of Hadza demography with surrounding non-Hadza and with the !Kung. Among other things, we find that the Hadza have a higher population density, higher fertility, and a faster population growth rate than do the !Kung. These demographic differences are consistent with our expectations, which were based on differences in the costs and benefits of foraging in the two regions.We also show that Hadza demographic parameters display remarkable consistency over the past 20 years. Since neighboring populations have been encroaching on the area used by the Hadza, and Hadza foragers have been subject to interludes of externally imposed settlement, this consistency is surprising. We discuss some of the implications. Â© 1992 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract      = {Division of labour is of fundamental importance for the success of societies, yet little is known about how individual specialization affects the fitness of the group as a whole. While specialized workers may be more efficient in the tasks they perform than generalists, they may also lack the flexibility to respond to rapid shifts in task needs. Such rigidity could impose fitness costs when societies face dynamic and unpredictable events, such as an attack by socially parasitic slavemakers. Here, we experimentally assess the colony-level fitness consequences of behavioural specialization in Temnothorax longispinosus ants that are attacked by the slavemaker ant T. americanus. We manipulated the social organization of 102 T. longispinosus colonies, based on the behavioural responses of all 3842 workers. We find that strict specialization is disadvantageous for a colony{\textquoteright}s annual reproduction and growth during slave raids. These fitness costs may favour generalist strategies in dynamic environments, as we also demonstrate that societies exposed to slavemakers in the field show a lower degree of specialization than those originating from slavemaker-free populations. Our findings provide an explanation for the ubiquity of generalists and highlight their importance for the flexibility and functional robustness of entire societies.},

A total of 209 temperature measurements from 11 years surveillance were used to calculate transport distances until 90% inactivation of the E. coli. Three scenario sets of different site specific values for the first order reference inactivation rate constant k20 (0.145, 0.230 and 0.555 dayâ1) and temperature coefficient of the rate constant \{Q10\} (2.07, 1.50 and 1.86) were tested in the upper parts of river IndalsÃ¤lven, in northern Scandinavia. The first and third parameter sets represented respectively pristine water and lake water while the second setting was considered most representative of river IndalsÃ¤lven. All three scenarios demonstrated considerable transport distances of E. coli with a clear and structured seasonal variation. The longest transport distances observed during late winter and spring are caused by a combination of low water temperature and high water velocity. The results have implications for water management decisions within the watersheds of oligotrophic rivers in cold and temperate climate. },

  abstract      = {The input of mercury (Hg) to ecosystems is estimated to have increased two- to fivefold during the industrial era, and Hg accumulates in aquatic biota as neurotoxic methylmercury (MeHg). Escalating anthropogenic land use and climate change are expected to alter the input rates of terrestrial natural organic matter (NOM) and nutrients to aquatic ecosystems. For example, climate change has been projected to induce 10 to 50\% runoff increases for large coastal regions globally. A major knowledge gap is the potential effects on MeHg exposure to biota following these ecosystem changes. We monitored the fate of five enriched Hg isotope tracers added to mesocosm scale estuarine model ecosystems subjected to varying loading rates of nutrients and terrestrial NOM. We demonstrate that increased terrestrial NOM input to the pelagic zone can enhance the MeHg bioaccumulation factor in zooplankton by a factor of 2 to 7 by inducing a shift in the pelagic food web from autotrophic to heterotrophic. The terrestrial NOM input also enhanced the retention of MeHg in the water column by up to a factor of 2, resulting in further increased MeHg exposure to pelagic biota. Using mercury mass balance calculations, we predict that MeHg concentration in zooplankton can increase by a factor of 3 to 6 in coastal areas following scenarios with 15 to 30\% increased terrestrial runoff. The results demonstrate the importance of incorporating the impact of climate-induced changes in food web structure on MeHg bioaccumulation in future biogeochemical cycling models and risk assessments of Hg.},

A study was undertaken of semen samples from 1082 fertile men from four European cities (Copenhagen, Denmark; Paris, Fra nce; Edinburgh, Scotland; and Turku, Finland). Semen analysis was standardized, inter-laboratory differences in assessment of sperm concentration were evaluated , and morphology assessment centralized. Lowest sperm concentrations and total c ounts were detected for Danish men, followed by French and Scottish men. Finnish men had the highest sperm counts. Men from Edinburgh had the highest proportion of motile spermatozoa, followed by men from Turku, Copenhagen and Paris. Only t he differences between Paris/Edinburgh and Paris/Turku were statistically signif icant (P < 0.003 and P < 0.002 respectively). No significant differences in morp hology were detected. A general seasonal variation in sperm concentration (summe r 70\% of winter) and total sperm count (summer 72\% of winter) was detected. Seme n quality of a 'standardized' man (30 years old, fertile, ejaculation abstinence of 96 h) were estimated. Typically, sperm concentrations (x 10(6)/ml) for winte r/summer were: Turku 132/93; Edinburgh 119/84; Paris 103/73; and Copenhagen 98/6 9. These differences in semen quality may indicate different environmental expos ures or lifestyle changes in the four populations. However, it remains to be see n whether such changes can account for these differences. These data may also se rve as a reference point for future studies on time trends in semen quality in E urope. },

Groups of young men from Denmark, Norway, Finland and Estonia were investigated to elucidate whether semen parameters and other related parameters follow a gradient between these countries, as does the gradient in incidence of testicular cancer. METHODS: In total, 968 young men from the general population in these four countries were investigated according to the same protocol. Possible confounders were evaluated, and included in the statistical analysis when appropriate. Inter-laboratory differences in assessment of sperm concentrations were controlled by an external quality control programme and morphology assessment was centralized to one person. RESULTS: The Finnish and Estonian men had an adjusted median sperm concentration of 54 and 57 x 10(6)/ml, respectively and the Norwegian and Danish men 41 x 10(6)/ml. The corresponding total sperm counts were 185, 174, 133 and 144 x 10(6). The frequency of normal sperm in men from Finland was 8.9\%, Estonia 9.2\%, Norway 6.9\% and Denmark 6.4\%. Within all four groups of men, a relationship between increasing levels of inhibin-B and increasing sperm counts was observed. However, inhibin-B levels were not predictive of sperm count differences between countries. CONCLUSIONS: It is believed that the men examined were representative of the normal population of young men in all four countries as they were recruited from groups attending a compulsory medical examination, and not selected for known fertility or semen quality. Moreover, the majority of participants had no prior knowledge of their fertility potential. It appears that an east-west gradient exists in the Nordic-Baltic area with regard to semen parameters, this being in parallel with the incidences of testicular cancer. Further investigations are required to determine whether these findings are due to genetic differences, to different environments, or perhaps to a combination of both factors.},

  abstract      = {Field studies were undertaken to investigate if wild plants alone can be used as food to supply the necessary quantities of carbohydrates during survival and evasion. In these situations, attention must be drawn to the physiological effects of hypoglycemia and the proper utilisation of the adipose tissue as energy in conjunction with minimizing the breakdown of proteins. The results show that it is possible to collect wild plants daily within 4 h with a carbohydrate content which amounts to at least 2 MJ. This will be enough to maintain the blood glucose concentration at the initial value without a simultaneous gluconeogenesis, and will prevent the production and excretion of ketone bodies. The studies demonstrate that plants are a good source of food in survival situations, allowing the survivor to perform hard and prolonged physical work during periods of restricted food intake. The study is part of a military survival project which forms the basis of a new military survival training program.},

  abstract      = {Summary This paper provides the official recommendation of the Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme (UIAA) Medical Commission to manage the problem of safe drinking water. The recommendation was accepted and authorized for publication by the Medical Commission during their annual meeting at Treplice, Tzechia, 2008. Safe water is essential for mountaineers worldwide in order to balance challenges associated with high altitude dehydration. The paper summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of several procedures used to procure safe drinking water in the mountains or at high altitude. Limitations or critical details, which may cause failure of the methods are mentioned systematically. We differentiate between âconventionalâ methods, which should be preferred because they produce safe water and âimprovisationâ. The latter does not produce safe water but may be used if conventional methods are not available for any reason. They decrease the concentration of pathogenic microorganisms and by this they reduce the risk of enteral infection. Water filtration using a ceramic filter system or chemical disinfection is recommended as a standard method. Boiling water should be avoided because it is too fuel consuming and has the potential to increase deforestation. Generally, with regard to infections by water or food, all mountaineers should be vaccinated against hepatitis A and poliomyelitis in regions where they may be at-risk. },

Studies in the past 10 years have suggested that apes and scrub jays are also able to make such plans. However, these studies{\textemdash}especially those in the birds{\textemdash}have been questioned. It has been argued that planning in foraging and natural tasks is not the same as planning in a more general way. Kabadayi et al. tested ravens with tasks designed to specifically assess their general planning abilities (see the Perspective by Boeckle and Clayton). Confirming their forward-planning abilities, the birds performed at least as well as apes and small children in this complex cognitive task.Science, this issue p. 202; see also p. 126The ability to flexibly plan for events outside of the current sensory scope is at the core of being human and is crucial to our everyday lives and society. Studies on apes have shaped a belief that this ability evolved within the hominid lineage. Corvids, however, have shown evidence of planning their food hoarding, although this has been suggested to reflect a specific caching adaptation rather than domain-general planning. Here, we show that ravens plan for events unrelated to caching{\textemdash}tool-use and bartering{\textemdash}with delays of up to 17 hours, exert self-control, and consider temporal distance to future events. Their performance parallels that seen in apes and suggests that planning evolved independently in corvids, which opens new avenues for the study of cognitive evolution.},

Design: A school based survey of health, health behaviour, and behaviour in school which included questions about bullying and the Beck depression inventory, which includes items asking about suicidal ideation. Setting: Secondary schools in two regions of Finland. Participants: 16 410 adolescents aged 14-16. Results: There was an increased prevalence of depression and severe suicidal ideation among both those who were bullied and those who were bullies. Depression was equally likely to occur among those who were bullied and those who were bullies. It was most common among those students who were both bullied by others and who were also bullies themselves. When symptoms of depression were controlled for, suicidal ideation occurred most often among adolescents who were bullies. Conclusion: Adolescents who are being bullied and those who are bullies are at an increased risk of depression and suicide. The need for psychiatric intervention should be considered not only for victims of bullying but also for bullies. Key messages About 1 in 10 schoolchildren report being bullied weekly at school Adolescents who are bullied or who are bullies have an increased risk of depression and suicidal ideation Bullies are often as depressed as those who are bullied, and suicidal ideation is even more common among bullies Interventions aimed at reducing bullying in schools, as well as psychiatric assessment and treatment of bullies and those who are bullied, might also prevent depression and suicidal ideation},

is often extraneous and may compete with the deeper to-be-learned structure, consequently
hindering either the learning of relevant structure or its transfer to new situations. This hypothesis was
tested in 4 experiments in which 6- to 8-year-old children learned to read simple bar graphs. In some
conditions, the bars were monochromatic (i.e., No Extraneous Information), whereas in other conditions,
the bars consisted of columns of discrete countable objects (i.e., Extraneous Information). Results
demonstrated that the presence of extraneous information substantially attenuated learning; participants
tended to count the objects and failed to acquire the appropriate strategy. The interference effects
decreased with age. These findings present evidence of how extraneous information affects learning of
new mathematical knowledge. Broader implications of these findings for understanding the development
of the ability to filter task-irrelevant information and for educational practice are also discussed.

  abstract      = {BACKGROUND:Domestication of chicken is believed to have occurred in Southeast Asia, especially in Indus valley. However, non-inclusion of Indian red jungle fowl (RJF), Gallus gallus murghi in previous studies has left a big gap in understanding the relationship of this major group of birds. In the present study, we addressed this issue by analyzing 76 Indian birds that included 56 G. g. murghi (RJF), 16 G. g. domesticus (domestic chicken) and 4 G. sonneratii (Grey JF) using both microsatellite markers and mitochondrial D-loop sequences. We also compared the D-loop sequences of Indian birds with those of 779 birds obtained from GenBank.RESULTS:Microsatellite marker analyses of Indian birds indicated an average FST of 0.126 within G. g. murghi, and 0.154 within G. g. domesticus while it was more than 0.2 between the two groups. The microsatellite-based phylogenetic trees showed a clear separation of G. g. domesticus from G. g. murghi, and G. sonneratii. Mitochondrial DNA based mismatch distribution analyses showed a lower Harpending's raggedness index in both G. g. murghi (0.001515) and in Indian G. g. domesticus (0.0149) birds indicating population expansion. When meta analysis of global populations of 855 birds was carried out using median joining haplotype network, 43 Indian birds of G. g. domesticus (19 haplotypes) were distributed throughout the network sharing haplotypes with the RJFs of different origins.CONCLUSION:Our results suggest that the domestication of chicken has occurred independently in different locations of Asia including India. We found evidence for domestication of Indian birds from G. g. spadiceus and G. g. gallus as well as from G. g. murghi, corroborating multiple domestication of Indian and other domestic chicken. In contrast to the commonly held view that RJF and domestic birds hybridize in nature, the present study shows that G. g. murghi is relatively pure. Further, the study also suggested that the chicken populations have undergone population expansion, especially in the Indus valley.},

  abstract      = {Shift-work seriously affects the health and well-being of millions of people worldwide, and the
number of shift workers is constantly rising (currently approximately 20% of the workforce). While
some effects are acute, others lead to chronic syndromes that persist after retirement. Though health
problems in shift workers are well established, we still do not properly understand the causal
mechanisms underlying shift-work’s effects on health. One reason may be the heterogeneity in
shift-work research design and methodology, rendering comparison between studies difficult or
even impossible. Shift-work also involves a multitude of interacting factors, and we do not yet fully
understand many of these interactions. Interindividual differences between workers are central
predictors for health. Among these, individual differences in internal time (chronotype) should play
a key role in a worker’s ability to adjust to shift-work. While the importance of chronotype is
receiving increased attention in chronobiology, it is still being largely ignored by shift-work studies,
particularly by those performed in the field. Shift-work research would greatly benefit from increased
attention to circadian components in real-life shift-work situations.
Here, we summarize the current state of shift-work research in an attempt to address the reasons as
to why we still do not clearly understand the links between shift-work and health. The aim of
shift-work research should ultimately be to improve health and well-being (including social issues)
in shift workers by means of improved work schedules. Society as a whole would benefit from such
improvements – the individual worker, the health system, and industry.

  abstract      = {Previous research has suggested that bullying is an increasingly severe problem in schools. Such research has approached the phenomenon from two different angles. Earlier research has treated bullying and victimisation as separate entities. However, current research suggests that bullies and victims engage in a special dynamic and interactive relationship, thereby providing the need for studying any similarities and differences between bullies and victims in relation to various factors. The present research has approached bullying and victimisation in both ways. First, we studied differences between bullies, victims, and those not involved in relation to various demographic, school, well-being, and personality factors to identify factors that separate these three groups. In addition, we studied differences between those involved in bullying/victimisation (one group) and those never involved in relation to the same aforementioned factors to highlight aspects of the development of their special relationship (i.e., common factors). Prevalence rates and types of bullying/victimisation experienced/expressed in Scottish schools were also investigated. It was found that bullying and victimisation, when treated as separate entities, differed in relation to peer self-esteem, with bullies reporting higher levels of peer self-esteem than victims. When bullies and victims were treated as one group (involved), they were found to differ from the noninvolved group in relation to various factors, including school, well-being, and personality factors. The involved group was found to be disadvantaged in relation to all measures used. However, overall results indicated that from all these factors the best predictors of overall involvement as bully, victim, or bully-victim were Quality of School Life and school stress. The present results support the notion that bullying and victimisation could be treated, by future research, as both separate and/or interactive entities. This is so because bullying and victimisation were found to differ in relation to one personality factor, that is, peer self-esteem. However, Quality of School Life and school stress, both school factors, were found to be associated with the phenomenon as a whole. Results are discussed in relation to future development of antibullying policy in Scottish schools. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc. C1 Univ Stirling, Dept Psychol, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.},

Amatoxins, a group of bicyclic octapeptides occurring in some Amanita, Galerina and Lepiota species, induce deficient protein synthesis resulting in cell death, but might also exert toxicity through inducing apoptosis. Target organs are intestinal mucosa, liver and kidneys. Poisoning will result in dehydration and electrolyte derangement, liver necrosis and possibly kidney damage. In established poisoning the mainstay of treatment is optimum symptomatic and supportive care. No specific treatment is available, but some pharmaceuticals, like silibinin, benzylpenicillin and acetylcysteine, might have a role in limiting the extent of hepatic damage. Orellanine is a nephrotoxic bipyridine N-oxide found in some Cortinarius species. Its mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it has been shown to inhibit protein synthesis and to generate free oxygen radicals. As early symptoms often are lacking or vague, poisoning may initially be overlooked or misinterpreted and the patients usually present with established renal damage. Supportive care is the only therapeutic option. Tricholoma equestre might contain a myotoxin and repeated ingestion may cause significant rhabdomyolysis. Ingestion of Amanita smithiana and A. proxima has been reported to result in kidney damage. Gyromitrin, a toxic compound that is converted to hydrazines in the stomach, occurs in some Gyromitra species. It is mainly neurotoxic, but may also induce moderate hepatic damage and haemolysis.},

The advantage of retrieval practice generalized across texts identical to those commonly found in science education. The advantage of retrieval practice was observed with test questions that assessed comprehension and required students to make inferences. The advantage of retrieval practice occurred even when the criterial test involved creating concept maps. Our findings support the theory that retrieval practice enhances learning by retrieval-specific mechanisms rather than by elaborative study processes.

In three experiments, 88 children (mean age 10 years) studied a list of words and either restudied the items or practiced retrieving them. They then took a final free recall test (Experiments 1 and 2) or recognition test (Experiment 3). In all experiments, children showed robust retrieval practice effects. Although a range of individual differences in reading comprehension and processing speed were observed among these children, the benefits of retrieval practice were independent of these factors. The results contribute to the growing body of research supporting the mnemonic benefits of retrieval practice and provide preliminary evidence that practicing retrieval may be an effective learning strategy for children with varying levels of reading comprehension and processing speed.},

Children participated in their classrooms and completed activities with educational texts selected from the school curriculum. In Experiment 1, when children were asked to freely recall the texts, they recalled very little of the material (about 10%) and showed almost no improvement after rereading. In another condition that involved creating concept maps, the children produced only about 20% of the ideas on their maps, even though they viewed the texts during the entire activity. Experiments 2 and 3 explored ways to provide support during retrieval activities. In Experiment 2, children were very successful at retrieving knowledge on concept maps that were partially completed. In Experiment 3, a question map activity, where questions were displayed in a relational map format, was effective for guiding retrieval practice and improving learning relative to repeated studying. The results demonstrate the importance of examining strategies that work with college students with young children in educational settings using authentic materials. The results also highlight the need for guided retrieval practice in young children. },

However, little is known about the difficulties experienced among this population. Specifically, those with a high intellectual capacity (hyper brain) possess overexcitabilities in various domains that may predispose them to certain psychological disorders as well as physiological conditions involving elevated sensory, and altered immune and inflammatory responses (hyper body). The present study surveyed members of American Mensa, Ltd. (n=3715) in order to explore psychoneuroimmunological (PNI) processes among those at or above the 98th percentile of intelligence. Participants were asked to self-report prevalence of both diagnosed and/or suspected mood and anxiety disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and physiological diseases that include environmental and food allergies, asthma, and autoimmune disease. High statistical significance and a remarkably high relative risk ratio of diagnoses for all examined conditions were confirmed among the Mensa group 2015 data when compared to the national average statistics. This implicates high IQ as being a potential risk factor for affective disorders, ADHD, ASD, and for increased incidence of disease related to immune dysregulation. Preliminary findings strongly support a hyper brain/hyper body association which may have substantial individual and societal implications and warrants further investigation to best identify and serve this at-risk population.},

  abstract      = {AbstractBackground Many studies examining individual-level correlates in youth utilize self-report rather than objective measures of physical activity (PA). This utilization of self-report may result in associations that are not present when examining objectively measured PA. The present study investigates the relationship between hypothesized correlates of \{PA\} with objectively and subjectively measured PA. Methods Participating children (nÂ =Â 232, 101 males, mean ageÂ =Â 12.3 years) provided a minimum of four monitored days of \{PA\} (via accelerometer) and completed a survey assessing moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), sport competence, appearance, enjoyment, and self-efficacy. Height and weight were measured and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Results Hierarchical regression models controlling for sex, race, and \{BMI\} Z-score showed that only sex and \{BMI\} Z-score were significant correlates of objective \{MVPA\} while only sex was a significant correlate of objective total PA. However, in a separate model examining the relationship with subjective MVPA, enjoyment of \{PA\} and self-efficacy for \{PA\} were the only significant correlates of self-reported PA. Conclusion Measuring \{MVPA\} via self-report versus accelerometry produces considerably different results in a sample of young adolescents. Future studies should use caution when selecting outcome measures if the intent is to identify modifiable correlates of \{MVPA\} in youth. },

  abstract      = {The topic of EDCs presents significant issues to the risk assessment process. In Table I, we have summarized many of the issues raised above. We have a working definition of an EDC, that provides a starting point for considering what chemicals are of concern. We also have an understanding of the important biological endpoints. Significantly, there are indications that large scale impacts might be occurring in both human and wildlife populations. Should these effects be confirmed and the causative agents identified, we will face difficult risk management decisions to minimize or mitigate the risks. Our present knowledge base, however, suggests that the traditional approach to assessing both noncancer and cancer endpoints will be suitable for toxicity mediated through disruption of endocrine systems, although there is controversy here as well. The fact that many EDCs share a common MOA should, in fact, assist in developing more scientifically defensible risk assessments, given that we must often extrapolate across doses and species in the absence of a mechanistic basis for noncancer effects. As more research focuses on the key uncertainties, we should acquire a better vision of the relative risks that EDCs pose to humans and wildlife.},

  abstract      = {Over biological history, several different groups of vertebrate tetrapods have reinvaded the marine environment. Although these groups are widely distributed among reptiles, mammals, amphibians, and birds, the shapes they have evolved are remarkably similar. Kelley and Pyenson review the literature on marine vertebrate groups over time and describe the innovations that facilitated the evolution of these marine forms, the environmental conditions that selected for such convergence of form, and the threats they face from future environment change.Science, this issue 10.1126/science.aaa3716 BACKGROUND More than 30 different lineages of amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals have independently invaded oceans ecosystems. Prominent examples include ichthyosaurs and mosasaurs during the Mesozoic (252 to 66 million years ago) and penguins and sea otters during the Cenozoic (66 million years ago to the present). In today{\textquoteright}s oceans, marine tetrapods are ecologically important consumers with trophic influence disproportionate to their abundance. They have occupied apex roles in ocean food webs for more than 250 million years, through major changes in ocean and climate, and through mass extinctions. Major paleontological discoveries in the past 40 years have clarified the early land-sea transitions for some marine tetrapods (e.g., whales, sea cows), although the terrestrial origins of many lineages remain obscure. Incipient invasions appear frequently in marine tetrapod history, but such early transitions account for only a small proportion of the total fossil record of successful marine lineages, which in some cases persist for hundreds of millions of years. ADVANCES Marine tetrapods provide ideal models for testing macroevolutionary hypotheses because the repeated transitions between land and sea have driven innovation, convergence, and diversification against a backdrop of changing marine ecosystems and mass extinctions. Recent investigations across a broad range of scales{\textemdash}from molecules to food webs{\textemdash}have clarified the phylogenetic scope, timing, and ecological consequences of these repeated innovations. Studies of the physiology and functional morphology of living species have illuminated the constraints and tradeoffs that shape the pathway of initial marine invasions. Comparative studies on muscle myoglobin concentration or the evolution of sex determination mechanisms, for example, have revealed rampant convergence for these adaptive traits in the marine realm. Exceptionally preserved fossils have also revealed insights into reproductive biology, soft tissue structures, and trophic interactions. Fossils provide critical baselines for understanding historical changes in marine communities and diversity through time, and these baselines remain vital for evaluating the ongoing and severe anthropogenic disturbance to marine tetrapod populations and marine ecosystems as a whole. OUTLOOK Technological advances in remote sensing and biologging will continue to provide crucial insights into the macroecology of marine tetrapods below the water{\textquoteright}s edge. Field data, when combined with extensive vouchers represented in museum collections, provide the basis for integrative models of the function and ecology of these logistically challenging organisms. Placed in a phylogenetic comparative framework, these data can enable tests of hypotheses about macroevolutionary patterns. Although perpetually incomplete, new fossil discoveries continue to improve our understanding of the early land-sea transitions in lineages and reveal past ecologies that could not have otherwise been predicted. Emerging imaging, molecular, and isotopic techniques provide an opportunity to expand the investigational scope for studying extinct taxa and to inform our understanding of how living species evolved. Lastly, resolving the full evolutionary scope of marine tetrapod history provides context for the origins of modern ecological patterns and interactions, which are fundamentally being altered by human activities. A unified view of marine tetrapod evolution. Circles mark initial invasions of marine tetrapod groups. Extinct and extant lineages are denoted by open and solid circles, respectively (yellow, amphibians; green, nonavian reptiles; blue, birds; red, mammals). Top curve summarizes marine tetrapod fossil richness through time. Schematic limb drawings demonstrate convergent hydrodynamic forelimbs in marine tetrapods (top to bottom): sea lion, whale, penguin, sea turtle, mosasaur, ichthyosaur. Ma, millions of years ago. Many top consumers in today{\textquoteright}s oceans are marine tetrapods, a collection of lineages independently derived from terrestrial ancestors. The fossil record illuminates their transitions from land to sea, yet these initial invasions account for a small proportion of their evolutionary history. We review the history of marine invasions that drove major changes in anatomy, physiology, and ecology over more than 250 million years. Many innovations evolved convergently in multiple clades, whereas others are unique to individual lineages. The evolutionary arcs of these ecologically important clades are framed against the backdrop of mass extinctions and regime shifts in ocean ecosystems. Past and present human disruptions to marine tetrapods, with cascading impacts on marine ecosystems, underscore the need to link macroecology with evolutionary change.},

Effects of two short-term, intermittent hypoxic training protocols on the finger temperature response to local cold stress. High Alt Med Biol 16:251–260, 2015.—The study examined the effects of two short-term, intermittent hypoxic training protocols, namely exercising in hypoxia and living in normoxia (LL-TH; n=8), and exercising in normoxia preceded by a series of brief intermittent hypoxic exposures at rest (IHE+NOR; n=8), on the finger temperature response during a sea-level local cold test. In addition, a normoxic group was assigned as a control group (NOR; n=8). All groups trained on a cycle-ergometer 1 h/day, 5 days/week for 4 weeks at 50% of peak power output. Pre, post, and 11 days after the last training session, subjects immersed their right hand for 30 min in 8°C water. In the NOR group, the average finger temperature was higher in the post (+2.1°C) and 11-day after (+2.6°C) tests than in the pre-test (p≤0.001). Conversely, the fingers were significantly colder immediately after both hypoxic protocols (LL-TH: −1.1°C, IHE+NOR: −1.8°C; p=0.01). The temperature responses returned to the pre-training level 11 days after the hypoxic interventions. Ergo, present findings suggest that short-term intermittent hypoxic training impairs sea-level local cold tolerance; yet, the hypoxic-induced adverse responses seem to be reversible within a period of 11 days.},

  abstract      = {Cold-induced vasodilatation (CIVD) is a cyclical increase in finger temperature that has been suggested to provide cryoprotective function during cold exposures. Physical fitness has been suggested as a potential factor that could affect CIVD response, possibly via central (increased cardiac output, decreased sympathetic nerve activity) and/or peripheral (increased microcirculation) cardiovascular and neural adaptations to exercise training. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of endurance exercise training on the CIVD response. Eighteen healthy males trained 1 h d−1 on a cycle ergometer at 50% of peak power output, 5 days week−1 for 4-weeks. Pre, Mid, Post, and 10 days after the cessation of training and on separate days, subjects performed an incremental exercise test to exhaustion (V⋅O2peak),(V⋅O2peak), and a 30-min hand immersion in 8°C water to examine their CIVD response. The exercise-training regimen significantly increased V⋅O2peakV⋅O2peak (Pre: 46.0 ± 5.9, Mid: 52.5 ± 5.7, Post: 52.1 ± 6.2, After: 52.6 ± 7.6 ml kg−1 min−1; P < 0.001). There was a significant increase in average finger skin temperature (Pre: 11.9 ± 2.4, After: 13.5 ± 2.5°C; P < 0.05), the number of waves (Pre: 1.1 ± 1.0, After: 1.7 ± 1.1; P < 0.001) and the thermal sensation (Pre: 1.7 ± 0.9, After: 2.5 ± 1.4; P < 0.001), after training. In conclusion, the aforementioned endurance exercise training significantly improved the finger CIVD response during cold-water hand immersion.

A distinction is made between aggregate studies of overall stress effects and focused studies of particular events and difficulties. A distinction is also made between effects of life stress on first onset of depression and on the subsequent course of depression. Although the available evidence suggests that acute stressful life events can lead to the recurrence of episodes of major depression, a series of methodological problems compromise our ability to make clear causal inferences about the effects of life events on first onset of major depression or about the effects of chronic stress on either onset or recurrence of depression. The main problems of this sort are discussed, and recommendations made for ways of addressing these problems in future studies. },

  abstract      = {The increasing rate of failure of antidepressant clinical trials has led to the assertion that antidepressants do not have meaningful clinical benefits. Our hypothesis was that the decrease in antidepressant–placebo differences in antidepressant clinical trials over the past three decades could be explained by changes in research design features rather than a lack of potency of the antidepressants being tested. We collected data from 130 double blind placebo controlled antidepressant clinical trials conducted between 1981 and 2008 that included 35,122 depressed patients with 23,157 patients assigned to antidepressants and 11,965 assigned to placebo. We conducted a hierarchical regression analysis of change in HAM-D scores in antidepressant and placebo groups separately with year of publication, and research design features as independent variables. We found that antidepressant–placebo differences in antidepressant clinical trials have declined markedly over the past three decades. Decline in change scores in the antidepressant group was related to mean total baseline HAM-D scores in the trial, the version of HAM-D used, and duration of trial. Similarly, decline in change scores in the placebo group was related to mean total baseline HAM-D scores, duration of trial, and year of publication. Overall, we found that antidepressant–placebo differences were statistically significantly higher in trials that used HAM-D 21 rather than HAM-D 17 and in trials that lasted 6 weeks or less. These data suggest that, apart from the efficacy of the antidepressant being tested, factors such as baseline HAM-D scores, version of HAM-D used and duration of trial have a significant impact on outcome. As such a clinician's assessment of the usefulness of antidepressants should not be based solely on the results of such clinical trials. In the meantime there is a need for continuing research to improve the methodology of antidepressant clinical trials. These data suggest that many aspects of the design of antidepressant trials have a significant impact on outcome. Further, these data suggest that the results of more recent placebo controlled trials do not adequately inform clinicians about the potential utility of antidepressants.},

MBT did not differ from traditional CBT or behavioral therapies (n=9; Hedge's g=â.07) or pharmacological treatments (n=3; Hedge's g=.13). MBT is an effective treatment for a variety of psychological problems, and is especially effective for reducing anxiety, depression, and stress.},

On the other hand, open-plan layouts are widely acknowledged to be more disruptive due to uncontrollable noise and loss of privacy. Based on the occupant survey database from Center for the Built Environment (CBE), empirical analyses indicated that occupants assessed Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) issues in different ways depending on the spatial configuration (classified by the degree of enclosure) of their workspace. Enclosed private offices clearly outperformed open-plan layouts in most aspects of IEQ, particularly in acoustics, privacy and the proxemics issues. Benefits of enhanced âease of interactionâ were smaller than the penalties of increased noise level and decreased privacy resulting from open-plan office configuration. },

Here we present a draft map of the human proteome using high-resolution Fourier-transform mass spectrometry. In-depth proteomic profiling of 30 histologically normal human samples, including 17 adult tissues, 7 fetal tissues and 6 purified primary haematopoietic cells, resulted in identification of proteins encoded by 17,294 genes accounting for approximately 84% of the total annotated protein-coding genes in humans. A unique and comprehensive strategy for proteogenomic analysis enabled us to discover a number of novel protein-coding regions, which includes translated pseudogenes, non-coding RNAs and upstream open reading frames. This large human proteome catalogue (available as an interactive web-based resource at http://www.humanproteomemap.org) will complement available human genome and transcriptome data to accelerate biomedical research in health and disease.},

A living body can only maintain its core temperature when heat production and heat loss are balanced. That means that heat transport from body core to skin must equal heat transport from skin to the environment. This study focuses on what combinations of core and skin temperature satisfy the biophysical requirements of being in the thermoneutral zone for humans. Moreover, consequences are considered of changes in insulation and adding restrictions such as thermal comfort (i.e. driver for thermal behavior). A biophysical model was developed that calculates heat transport within a body, taking into account metabolic heat production, tissue insulation, and heat distribution by blood flow and equates that to heat loss to the environment, considering skin temperature, ambient temperature and other physical parameters. The biophysical analysis shows that the steady-state ambient temperature range associated with the thermoneutral zone does not guarantee that the body is in thermal balance at basal metabolic rate per se. Instead, depending on the combination of core temperature, mean skin temperature and ambient temperature, the body may require significant increases in heat production or heat loss to maintain stable core temperature. Therefore, the definition of the thermoneutral zone might need to be reformulated. Furthermore, after adding restrictions on skin temperature for thermal comfort, the ambient temperature range associated with thermal comfort is smaller than the thermoneutral zone. This, assuming animals seek thermal comfort, suggests that thermal behavior may be initiated already before the boundaries of the thermoneutral zone are reached.},

Only laboratory-based measurements were used to avoid confounding effects with differences in litter input rates, litter quality, soil moisture or other environmental factors. A considerable range of values has been reported, with the greatest relative sensitivity of decomposition processes to temperature having been observed at low temperatures. A relationship fitted to the literature data indicated that the rate of decomposition increases with temperature at 0°C with a Q10 of almost 8. The temperature sensitivity of organic matter decomposition decreases with increasing temperature, indicated by the Q10 decreasing with temperature to be about 4.5 at 10°C and 2.5 at 20°C. At low temperatures, the temperature sensitivity of decomposition was consequently much greater than the temperature sensitivity of net primary productivity, whereas the temperature sensitivities became more similar at higher temperatures. The much higher temperature sensitivity of decomposition than for net primary productivity has important implications for the store of soil organic C in the soil. The data suggest that a 1°C increase in temperature could ultimately lead to a loss of over 10\% of soil organic C in regions of the world with an annual mean temperature of 5°C, whereas the same temperature increase would lead to a loss of only 3\% of soil organic C for a soil at 30°C. These differences are even greater in absolute amounts as cooler soils contain greater amounts of soil organic C. This analysis supports the conclusion of previous studies which indicated that soil organic C contents may decrease greatly with global warming and thereby provide a positive feed-back in the global C cycle.},

  abstract      = {Cyclooxygenase (COX)-3, a novel COX splice variant, was suggested as the key to unlocking the mystery of the mechanism of action of acetaminophen. Although COX-3 might have COX activity in canines, and this activity might be inhibited by acetaminophen, its low expression level and the kinetics indicate unlikely clinical relevance. In rodents and humans, COX-3 encodes proteins with completely different amino acid sequences than COX-1 or COX-2 and without COX activity; therefore, it is improbable that COX-3 in these species plays a role in prostaglandin-mediated fever and pain. The aim of this review is to evaluate the literature that seeks to point out critical theoretical and methodological limitations of the COX-3 studies that led several investigators to scientifically questionable conclusions.

  abstract      = {Drivers who are 15 to 20 years of age constitute 6.4% of all drivers, but they account for 10.0% of all motor vehicle traffic deaths and 14.0% of all police-reported crashes resulting in injuries.1 These rates are thought to result from a combination of young age, inexperience, and risky driving behaviors.2

One of the riskiest driving behaviors is the performance of a secondary task, and novice drivers appear to be particularly prone to this distraction.3 Distracted driving has been defined as the “diversion of attention away from activities critical for safe driving toward a competing activity.”4 Drivers engage in many competing tasks (including eating, adjusting the radio, and talking to passengers) that are not related to operating the vehicle in traffic, but the use of electronic devices such as cell phones while driving has garnered the most public and mass-media interest. An estimated 9% of all persons who drive during the day do so while dialing or talking on a cell phone or sending or receiving text messages.3

Estimates based on cell-phone records indicate that cell-phone use among all drivers increases the risk of a crash by a factor of 4.5,6 Likewise, simulator studies involving adolescent drivers indicate that texting while driving increases the frequency of deviations in a lane relative to the position from the centerline.7 Adolescents who were using a cell phone on a test track were more likely than experienced adult drivers who were using a cell phone to enter an intersection at a red or yellow light.8 Simulation and test-track research on distraction among experienced drivers indicates that cell-phone use delays reaction to potential hazards,9-11 increases following distances,12 and decreases the driver's visual scanning of the environment.13,14 Performance of a secondary task can increase the risk of a crash because it is cognitively demanding (preventing the driver from devoting full attention to driving) and because it takes the driver's eyes off the road ahead so that he or she cannot see and respond to unexpected hazards.15

Both the 100-Car Naturalistic Driving Study (hereinafter called the 100-Car Study),14 which involved experienced drivers, and the Naturalistic Teenage Driving Study (NTDS),16 which involved novice drivers, used data-recording devices installed in the participants' vehicles to assess their behaviors while driving and during a crash or near-crash. In previous analyses of NTDS data, we reported that among newly licensed drivers, the rates of crashes or near-crashes were 3.9 times as high as the corresponding rates among their parents when they drove the same vehicles, and the rates of a gravitational-force event (e.g., hard braking or making sharp turns or an overcorrection) were 5.1 times as high.15 Here we report the results of our analysis of both studies with respect to the prevalence of engagement in a secondary task and the associated risk of a crash or near-crash among novice and experienced drivers.},

The present review examines whether detox diets are necessary, what they involve, whether they are effective and whether they present any dangers. Although the detox industry is booming, there is very little clinical evidence to support the use of these diets. A handful of clinical studies have shown that commercial detox diets enhance liver detoxification and eliminate persistent organic pollutants from the body, although these studies are hampered by flawed methodologies and small sample sizes. There is preliminary evidence to suggest that certain foods such as coriander, nori and olestra have detoxification properties, although the majority of these studies have been performed in animals. To the best of our knowledge, no randomised controlled trials have been conducted to assess the effectiveness of commercial detox diets in humans. This is an area that deserves attention so that consumers can be informed of the potential benefits and risks of detox programmes.},

Glucose rate of appearance (Ra) and disappearance (Rd) were calculated from plasma glucose enrichment during a primed, continuous infusion of [6,6–2H]glucose. Serum substrates and insulin levels were measured and glycogen content of the vastus lateralis was determined in biopsies taken before and after exercise. At rest, whole-body glucose flux (determined by the deuterated tracer) and carbohydrate oxidation (determined from respiratory exchange ratio) were lower in F than PA, but muscle glycogen levels were similar. During exercise, glucose flux, whole-body carbohydrate oxidation, and the rate of muscle glycogen utilization were significantly lower during the fast. In the PA state, glucose Ra and Rd increased together throughout exercise. However, in the F state Ra exceeded Rd during the 1st h of exercise, causing an increase in plasma glucose to levels similar to those of the PA state. The increase in glucose flux was markedly less throughout F exercise. Lower carbohydrate utilization in the F state was accompanied by higher circulating fatty acids and ketone bodies, lower plasma insulin levels, and the maintenance of physical performance reflected by similar time to exhaustion.},

To assist the research community, we report a software usability study in which 40 researchers across different disciplines prepared scholarly texts with either Microsoft Word or LaTeX. The probe texts included simple continuous text, text with tables and subheadings, and complex text with several mathematical equations. We show that LaTeX users were slower than Word users, wrote less text in the same amount of time, and produced more typesetting, orthographical, grammatical, and formatting errors. On most measures, expert LaTeX users performed even worse than novice Word users. LaTeX users, however, more often report enjoying using their respective software. We conclude that even experienced LaTeX users may suffer a loss in productivity when LaTeX is used, relative to other document preparation systems. Individuals, institutions, and journals should carefully consider the ramifications of this finding when choosing document preparation strategies, or requiring them of authors.},

Their model for the evolution of anisogamy requires only that zygote fitness (F) increase steeply with increases in zygote volume (V) (for Focâ Vx, x must be greater than 1Â·5) and that a sufficiently broad range of zygote productivity-size variants exist in the population (the higher the value of x, the broader the range needed). They suggest that anisogamy is almost universal in multicellular organisms but relatively rare in unicellular organisms because only for the former is an investment in extra gametic reserves at the expense of the number of gametes produced likely to be worthwhile in terms of increasing the survival probability of the zygote. In this note a graphical analysis and evidence from the anisogamous Protista will be presented concerning this hypothesis.},

In all four species, two types of symbionts are present: bacterium Sulcia (phylum Bacteroidetes) and yeast-like symbionts closely related to the entomopathogenic fungi (phylum Ascomycota, class Sordariomycetes). Sulcia bacteria are always harbored in giant bacteriocytes, which are grouped into large organs termed ``bacteriomes.'' In F. septentrionalis, G. ventralis, and O. ishidae, numerous yeast-like microorganisms are localized in cells of the fat body, whereas in C. quadrinotata, they occupy the cells of midgut epithelium in large number.

  abstract      = {Grounding lines are a key indicator of ice-sheet instability, because changes in their position reflect imbalance with the surrounding ocean and affect the flow of inland ice. Although the grounding lines of several Antarctic glaciers have retreated rapidly due to ocean-driven melting, records are too scarce to assess the scale of the imbalance. Here, we combine satellite altimeter observations of ice-elevation change and measurements of ice geometry to track grounding-line movement around the entire continent, tripling the coverage of previous surveys. Between 2010 and 2016, 22%, 3% and 10% of surveyed grounding lines in West Antarctica, East Antarctica and at the Antarctic Peninsula retreated at rates faster than 25âmâyrâ1 (the typical pace since the Last Glacial Maximum) and the continent has lost 1,463âkm2âÂ±â791âkm2 of grounded-ice area. Although by far the fastest rates of retreat occurred in the Amundsen Sea sector, we show that the Pine Island Glacier grounding line has stabilized, probably as a consequence of abated ocean forcing. On average, Antarcticaâs fast-flowing ice streams retreat by 110âmetres per metre of ice thinning.},

To deepen our knowledge of cellular transcription, we have determined the structure of the 13-subunit DNA-directed RNAP from Sulfolobus shibatae at 3.35 {\r{A}} resolution. The structure contains the full complement of subunits, including RpoG/Rpb8 and the equivalent of the clamp-head and jaw domains of the eukaryotic Rpb1. Furthermore, we have identified subunit Rpo13, an RNAP component in the order Sulfolobales, which contains a helix-turn-helix motif that interacts with the RpoH/Rpb5 and RpoA/Rpb1 subunits. Its location and topology suggest a role in the formation of the transcription bubble.},

I investigated the spacing effect in the realistic context of flashcard use. Learners often divide flashcards into relatively small stacks, but compared to a large stack, small stacks decrease the spacing between study trials. In three experiments, participants used a web-based study programme to learn GRE-type word pairs. Studying one large stack of flashcards (i.e. spacing) was more effective than studying four smaller stacks of flashcards separately (i.e. massing). Spacing was also more effective than crammingâthat is, massing study on the last day before the test. Across experiments, spacing was more effective than massing for 90% of the participants, yet after the first study session, 72% of the participants believed that massing had been more effective than spacing.

Recall tests, however, measure the number of items that are above a recall threshold, not memory strength per se. According to the model proposed in this paper, tests without feedback produce bifurcated item distributions: Retrieved items become stronger, but non-retrieved items remain weak, resulting in a gap between the two classes of items. Restudying items, on the other hand, strengthens all items, though to a lesser degree than does retrieval. These differing outcomes can make tested items appear to be forgotten more slowly than are restudied itemsâeven if all items are forgotten at the same rateâbecause the test-induced bifurcation leaves items either well above or well below threshold. We review prior evidence and present three new experiments designed to test the bifurcation interpretation.},

  abstract      = {Taking tests enhances learning. But what happens when one cannot answer a test questionâdoes an unsuccessful retrieval attempt impede future learning or enhance it? The authors examined this question using materials that ensured that retrieval attempts would be unsuccessful. In Experiments 1 and 2, participants were asked fictional general-knowledge questions (e.g., âWhat peace treaty ended the Calumet War?â). In Experiments 3â6, participants were shown a cue word (e.g., whale) and were asked to guess a weak associate (e.g., mammal); the rare trials on which participants guessed the correct response were excluded from the analyses. In the test condition, participants attempted to answer the question before being shown the answer; in the read-only condition, the question and answer were presented together. Unsuccessful retrieval attempts enhanced learning with both types of materials. These results demonstrate that retrieval attempts enhance future learning; they also suggest that taking challenging testsâinstead of avoiding errorsâmay be one key to effective learning.

Att jorden {\"{a}}r rund och en massa miljarder {\r{a}}r gammal, vad har det med hur jag behandlar min medm{\"{a}}nniska att g{\"{o}}ra, skriver Per Kornhall. UNT debatt har publicerat flera inl{\"{a}}gg genererade av den v{\r{a}}g av intelligent design-relaterat material som dykt upp i svenska medier som en efterdyning till r{\"{a}}tteg{\r{a}}ngen i Dover, USA. Skapelsetror{\"{o}}relsen i USA hade f{\"{o}}rlorat kampen om att f{\"{o}}ra in skapelsetro i det offentliga skolv{\"{a}}sendet. H{\"{o}}gsta domstolen fastslog f{\"{o}}r mer {\"{a}}n 20 {\r{a}}r sedan att skapelsetro {\"{a}}r en religionsut{\"{o}}vning och inte f{\r{a}}r undervisas inom biologi. Men r{\"{o}}relsen kunde naturligtvis inte ge sig med det. Detta {\"{a}}r m{\"{a}}nniskor som tror att evolutionsteori {\"{a}}r av ondo och att m{\"{a}}nniskor som tror p{\r{a}} den kommer att sluta sina liv i helvetet. F{\"{o}}r att f{\r{a}} en ny angreppspunkt lanserades d{\r{a}} i st{\"{a}}llet begreppet intelligent design, ID. Inom denna r{\"{o}}relse v{\"{a}}ljer man medvetet bort ord som gud eller skapelse. Syftet {\"{a}}r att g{\"{o}}ra skapelsetro godtagbar och "rumsren" i vidare kretsar. Att ID fortfarande {\"{a}}r en religi{\"{o}}s utsaga {\"{a}}r uppenbart och om man g{\r{a}}r in p{\r{a}} de organisationers hemsidor som driver den h{\"{a}}r kampanjen s{\r{a}} {\"{a}}r det ingen tvekan att det {\"{a}}r den kristne guden och skapelse enligt Bibeln som {\r{a}}syftas. Men ID, med sin ned­tonade profil, lockar m{\r{a}}nga apologeter som vill f{\"{o}}rs{\"{o}}ka ge gudstron ett rationellt ansikte men som inte k{\"{a}}nde sig hemma i den bibeltummande fanatismen. Detta {\"{a}}r en medveten strategi inom ID-r{\"{o}}relsen. Sj{\"{a}}lva r{\"{a}}tteg{\r{a}}ngen initierades av n{\r{a}}gra f{\"{o}}r{\"{a}}ldrar som st{\"{a}}mde skolstyrelsen i Dover. Denna hade beslutat att ID skulle undervisas som ett alternativ till biologisk vetenskap. Ett av {\r{a}}klagarvittnena har ber{\"{a}}ttat att skolstyrelsem{\"{o}}tet liknade ett v{\"{a}}ckelsem{\"{o}}te. Bibeln citerades, spridda "amen" h{\"{o}}rdes och hon fick efter{\r{a}}t veta att hon var p{\r{a}} v{\"{a}}g till helvetet eftersom hon best{\"{a}}mt sig f{\"{o}}r att r{\"{o}}sta emot och l{\"{a}}mna skolstyrelsen. Ett expertvittne redogjorde noggrant f{\"{o}}r historien bakom ID. Hon kunde bl a visa att den l{\"{a}}robok i ID som man best{\"{a}}mt sig f{\"{o}}r att k{\"{o}}pa in fr{\r{a}}n b{\"{o}}rjan inneh{\"{o}}ll ordet skapelse och skapelsetro men att alla dessa ord helt enkelt bytts ut mot intelligent design? Dessa sm{\r{a}} fragment fr{\r{a}}n r{\"{a}}tteg{\r{a}}ngen visar kanske vad det {\"{a}}r f{\"{o}}r krafter som {\"{a}}r i r{\"{o}}relse. Inl{\"{a}}ggen fr{\r{a}}n Bength Gustafson och Krister Renard speglar detta. De tillh{\"{o}}r den del av svensk frikyrklighet som vill fr{\"{a}}lsa Sverige. Bength Gustafson antyder i slutet av sin artikel att evolutionsteori f{\"{o}}r med sig d{\r{a}}lig etik och moral. Han g{\"{o}}r naturligtvis h{\"{a}}r ett kardinalfel. Vem har sagt att man skall ha naturvetenskapliga data eller teorier som grund f{\"{o}}r sin etik? Att jorden {\"{a}}r rund och en massa miljarder {\r{a}}r gammal, vad har det med hur jag behandlar min medm{\"{a}}nniska att g{\"{o}}ra? Skall vi l{\"{a}}ra barnen att jorden {\"{a}}r platt om vi tror att det g{\"{o}}r dem till b{\"{a}}ttre m{\"{a}}nniskor? Varf{\"{o}}r skulle evolutionsteori tillfredsst{\"{a}}lla mitt behov av mening? Bength Gustafsson blandar {\"{a}}pplen med p{\"{a}}ron p{\r{a}} ett s{\"{a}}tt som g{\"{o}}r hans referenser till Uppsala universitet ganska pinsamma. Han g{\"{o}}r ocks{\r{a}} den inom skapelsetro vanliga r{\"{a}}ttvisev{\"{a}}djan. Varf{\"{o}}r skall inte elever f{\r{a}} v{\"{a}}lja, fr{\r{a}}gar han, varf{\"{o}}r skall de inte presenteras f{\"{o}}r alternativa teorier? Samma fr{\r{a}}ga st{\"{a}}ller Krister Renard. Saken {\"{a}}r, f{\"{o}}r det f{\"{o}}rsta, att det inte finns n{\r{a}}gra alternativa teorier. Bara f{\"{o}}r att en religi{\"{o}}s minoritet har en annan tro kan man inte inom naturvetenskap undervisa annat {\"{a}}n etablerade vetenskapliga teorier. F{\"{o}}r det andra s{\r{a}} f{\r{a}}r svenska elever redan v{\"{a}}lja. Vi har religionskunskap p{\r{a}} schemat och en diskussion kring evolutionsteorins filosofiska konsekvenser och historiska betydelse f{\"{o}}rs i alla klassrum d{\"{a}}r biologi undervisas i Sverige. D{\"{a}}remot undervisas det inte om religi{\"{o}}sa trossatser s{\r{a}}som vetenskap (utom m{\"{o}}jligen p{\r{a}} vissa friskolor d{\"{a}}r definitionen av all­sidighet och saklighet skiljer sig fr{\r{a}}n den i samh{\"{a}}llet g{\"{a}}ngse). Vetenskapen gjorde sig fri fr{\r{a}}n den typen av styrning fr{\r{a}}n religionens sida redan p{\r{a}} 1600-talet och denna frihet finns inskriven i styrdokumenten f{\"{o}}r den svenska skolan. Jag vill p{\r{a}}st{\r{a}} att Krister Renard har en r{\"{a}}v bakom {\"{o}}rat. N{\"{a}}r man l{\"{a}}ser hans inl{\"{a}}gg kan man tro att det enda han vill {\"{a}}r att till{\r{a}}ta olika {\r{a}}sikter i Sverige. P{\r{a}} hans hemsida d{\"{a}}r han f{\"{o}}rklarar vad¨han egentligen vill kan man l{\"{a}}sa: "Jag tror det {\"{a}}r viktigt att kristen­heten inser var striden st{\r{a}}r ?s{\r{a}} l{\r{a}}t oss kristna rikta om kanonerna lite grand och b{\"{o}}rja skjuta p{\r{a}} sj{\"{a}}lva grunden f{\"{o}}r ateismen \u2014 evolutionen!". Varf{\"{o}}r tycker han att ID {\"{a}}r bra d{\r{a}}? "Genom att inte blanda in Gud eller n{\r{a}}gon speciell religion, kommer man f{\"{o}}rbi de blockeringar som m{\r{a}}nga m{\"{a}}nniskor har n{\"{a}}r det g{\"{a}}ller existensen av n{\r{a}}got {\"{o}}vernaturligt, och speciellt d{\r{a}} existensen av Gud." och "Och det {\"{a}}r just detta som intelligent designr{\"{o}}relsen tagit fasta p{\r{a}}. N{\"{a}}r m{\"{a}}nniskor v{\"{a}}l b{\"{o}}rjat accepterat existensen av en Designer kommer detta s{\"{a}}kert att leda till att de fr{\r{a}}gar sig vem denne Designer {\"{a}}r." Det han {\"{a}}r ute efter {\"{a}}r detsamma som resten av ID-r{\"{o}}relsen \u2014 att du och jag skall ta emot Jesus och bli medlemmar i deras kyrkor. ID {\"{a}}r helt enkelt kristen evangelisation iscensatt av fundamentalistiska str{\"{o}}mningar inom frikyrkligheten. Evolution {\"{a}}r som all annan komplicerad vetenskap ett didaktiskt och metodiskt problem. Hur l{\"{a}}r man p{\r{a}} ett enkelt och l{\"{a}}ttfattligt s{\"{a}}tt, under begr{\"{a}}nsad tid, ut all v{\r{a}}r nya kunskap om gener och evolution utan att n{\r{a}}gon annan del av biologin blir lidande? Vi befinner oss just nu i en fas d{\"{a}}r vi tack vare DNA-teknik p{\r{a}} ett helt nytt s{\"{a}}tt kan rekonstruera livets tr{\"{a}}d och st{\"{a}}lla nya fr{\r{a}}gor om v{\r{a}}rt och alla andra organismers ursprung. Svenska skolan har en uppgift i att f{\"{o}}rklara detta. Att samtidigt som forskningen befinner sig i en s{\r{a}} expansiv fas l{\"{a}}ra ut till sm{\r{a}} skolbarn att en icke namngiven intelligens skulle vara en godtagbar vetenskaplig f{\"{o}}rklaring till de m{\"{o}}nster som vi ser i de genetiska sekvenserna skulle knappast leda annat {\"{a}}n till religi{\"{o}}st bigotteri.

The analysis presented is based on a dataset of over 58,000 volunteers who provided their Facebook Likes, detailed demographic profiles, and the results of several psychometric tests. The proposed model uses dimensionality reduction for preprocessing the Likes data, which are then entered into logistic/linear regression to predict individual psychodemographic profiles from Likes. The model correctly discriminates between homosexual and heterosexual men in 88% of cases, African Americans and Caucasian Americans in 95% of cases, and between Democrat and Republican in 85% of cases. For the personality trait “Openness,” prediction accuracy is close to the test–retest accuracy of a standard personality test. We give examples of associations between attributes and Likes and discuss implications for online personalization and privacy.},

BACKGROUND:
The aim of the study was to determine whether urine color, osmolality and specific electrical conductance (SEC) provide an accurate index of hydration status and of fluid requirements during the recovery phase after an acute exercise-induced dehydration.

METHODS:

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:
eight well-trained healthy males were dehydrated about 3% of body mass, 3 times, by cycling in the heat. To rehydrate after exercise, three types of drinks frequently consumed by athletes postexercise, i.e. a caffeinated soft drink (CC), a mineral water (MW), or a carbohydrate-electrolyte solution (CES) were ingested ad libitum and in randomized cross-over design during the first 2 hrs of an observation period lasting 6 hrs.

MEASURES:
urine was sampled each hour for determination of color, osmolality and SEC. Net rehydration was calculated from fluid intake and fluid loss by sweat and urine.

RESULTS:
Fluid intake amounted 2.6 +/- 0.2 kg for CC, 2.2 +/- 0.2 kg for MW and 2.8 +/- 0.3 kg for CES representing 116%, 96% and 127% of fluid lost by sweat. Urine output showed a negative correlation with color, osmolality and SEC (p < 0.001). These variables were highly interrelated (p < 0.001). However, the level of rehydration did not correlate with any of the measured urinary variables (p > 0.05).

CONCLUSIONS:
Urine color, SEC and osmolality are poor indicators of hydration status measured from the balance between fluid intake and urine output up to 6 hrs postexercise.},

accounting 95–98% of all reported animal cases. Exposures occur more commonly in the summer and in December that is associated
with the holiday season. The majority (>90%) of animal poisonings are accidental and acute in nature and occur near or at the animal
owner's home. Feeding human foodstuff to pets may also prove dangerous for their health.
The aim of this review was to present common food items that should not be fed (intentionally or unintentionally) to dogs, i.e.
chocolate, caffeine, and other methylxanthines, grapes, raisins, onion, garlic, avocado, alcohol, nuts, xylitol contained in chewing
gum and candies, etc. Onion and avocado are toxic for cats, too. The clinical effects of individual toxicants and possible therapy are
also mentioned. Knowing what human food has the potential to be involved in serious toxicoses should allow veterinarians to better
educate their clients on means of preventing pet poisonings.
It can be concluded that the best advice must surely be to give animal fodder or treats specifically developed for their diets.

  abstract      = {Abstract Adhesives are an important yet often overlooked aspect of human tool use. Previous experiments have shown that compound resin/gum adhesive production by anatomically modern humans was a cognitively demanding task that required advanced use of fire, forward planning and abstraction, among other traits. Yet the oldest known adhesives were produced by Neandertals, not anatomically modern humans. These tar or pitch adhesives are an entirely different material, produced from a distinct, albeit similarly complex process. However, the material properties of these adhesives and the influence of the production process on performance are still unclear. To this end we conducted a series of laboratory based lap shear and impact tests following modern adhesive testing standards at three different temperatures to measure the strength of pine and birch pitch adhesives. We tested eight different recipes that contain charcoal as an additive (mimicking contamination) or were reduced by boiling (seething) for different lengths of time. Lap shear tests were conducted on wood and flint adherends to determine shear strength on different materials, and we conducted high load-rate tests to understand how the same material behaves under impact forces. Our results indicate that both pine and birch pitch adhesives behave similarly at room temperature. Pine pitch is highly sensitive to the addition of charcoal and further heating. Up to a certain extent, charcoal additives increase performance, as does extra seething. However, too much charcoal and seething will reduce performance. Similarly, pine pitch is sensitive to ambient temperature changes and it is strongest at 0 Â°C and weakest at 38 Â°C. Adhesive failures occur in a similar manner on flint and wood suggesting the weakest part of a flint-adhesive-wood composite tool may have been the cohesive strength of the adhesive. Finally, pine pitch adhesives may be better suited to resisting high-load rate impacts than static shear forces. Our experiments show that pitch production and post-production manipulation are sensitive processes, and to obtain a workable and strong adhesive one requires a deep understanding of the material properties. Our results validate previous archaeological adhesive studies that suggest that the manufacture and use of adhesives was an advanced technological process. },

Previous field and laboratory testing of adhesives has shown the complexities involved in creating an effective Middle Stone Age glue using Acacia gum. However, it is currently unclear how efficient different adhesive recipes are, how much specific ingredients influence their performance, and how difficult it may have been for those ingredients to be combined to maximum effect. We conducted a series of laboratory-based lap shear and impact tests, following modern adhesion testing standards, to determine the efficacy of compound adhesives, with particular regard to the ingredient ratios. We tested rosin (colophony) and gum adhesives, containing additives of beeswax and ochre in varying ratios. During both lap shear and impact tests compound rosin adhesives performed better than single component rosin adhesives, and pure acacia gum was the strongest. The large difference in performance between each base adhesive and the significant changes in performance that occur due to relatively small changes in ingredient ratios lend further support to the notion that high levels of skill and knowledge were required to consistently produce the most effective adhesives.},

  abstract      = {The destructive distillation of birch bark to produce tar has recently featured in debates about the technological and cognitive abilities of Neandertals and modern humans. The abilities to precisely control fire temperatures and to manipulate adhesive properties are believed to require advanced mental traits. However, the significance given to adhesive technology in these debates has quickly outgrown our understanding of birch bark tar and its manufacture using aceramic techniques. In this paper, we detail three experimental methods of Palaeolithic tar production ranging from simple to complex. We recorded the fuel, time, materials, temperatures, and tar yield for each method and compared them with the tar known from the Palaeolithic. Our results indicate that it is possible to obtain useful amounts of tar by combining materials and technology already in use by Neandertals. A ceramic container is not required, and temperature control need not be as precise as previously thought. However, Neandertals must have been able to recognize certain material properties, such as adhesive tack and viscosity. In this way, they could develop the technology from producing small traces of tar on partially burned bark to techniques capable of manufacturing quantities of tar equal to those found in the Middle Palaeolithic archaeological record.},

There is no direct evidence to date, however, linking these cognitive styles to specific neural systems. In the present study, visual and verbal cognitive styles are measured by self-report survey, and cognitive abilities are measured by scored tests of visual and verbal skills. Specifically, we administered the Verbalizer{\textendash}Visualizer Questionnaire (VVQ) and modality-specific subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) to 18 subjects who subsequently participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment. During the imaging session, participants performed a novel psychological task involving both word-based and picture-based feature matching conditions that was designed to permit the use of either a visual or a verbal processing style during all conditions of the task. Results demonstrated a pattern of activity in modality-specific cortex that distinguished visual from verbal cognitive styles. During the word-based condition, activity in a functionally defined brain region that responded to viewing pictorial stimuli (fusiform gyrus) correlated with self-reported visualizer ratings on the VVQ. In contrast, activity in a phonologically related brain region (supramarginal gyrus) correlated with the verbalizer dimension of the VVQ during the picture-based condition. Scores from the WAIS subtests did not reliably correlate with brain activity in either of these regions. These findings suggest that modality-specific cortical activity underlies processing in visual and verbal cognitive styles.},

Genetic research has shown that intelligence makes a major contribution to the heritability of educational achievement. However, we show that other broad domains of behavior such as personality and psychopathology also account for genetic influence on GCSE scores beyond that predicted by intelligence. Together with intelligence, these domains account for 75\% of the heritability of GCSE scores. These results underline the importance of genetics in educational achievement and its correlates. The results also support the trend in education toward personalized learning.Because educational achievement at the end of compulsory schooling represents a major tipping point in life, understanding its causes and correlates is important for individual children, their families, and society. Here we identify the general ingredients of educational achievement using a multivariate design that goes beyond intelligence to consider a wide range of predictors, such as self-efficacy, personality, and behavior problems, to assess their independent and joint contributions to educational achievement. We use a genetically sensitive design to address the question of why educational achievement is so highly heritable. We focus on the results of a United Kingdom-wide examination, the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE), which is administered at the end of compulsory education at age 16. GCSE scores were obtained for 13,306 twins at age 16, whom we also assessed contemporaneously on 83 scales that were condensed to nine broad psychological domains, including intelligence, self-efficacy, personality, well-being, and behavior problems. The mean of GCSE core subjects (English, mathematics, science) is more heritable (62\%) than the nine predictor domains (35{\textendash}58\%). Each of the domains correlates significantly with GCSE results, and these correlations are largely mediated genetically. The main finding is that, although intelligence accounts for more of the heritability of GCSE than any other single domain, the other domains collectively account for about as much GCSE heritability as intelligence. Together with intelligence, these domains account for 75\% of the heritability of GCSE. We conclude that the high heritability of educational achievement reflects many genetically influenced traits, not just intelligence.},

In further experiments using Dewar-flask calorimeters, the rate of heat elimination and rapidity of onset of the cold vasodilatation response on immersing the hand in water at 0°C were also recorded. The subjects were kept warm in order to remove as far as possible the effects of differing degrees of vasoconstrictor fiber activity. The onset of the cold vasodilatation was found to be more rapid in the cold-habituated subjects than in the control subjects. The levels of hand blood flow were, however, the same in all three groups of subjects, implying that habituation to cold does not alter the local vascular response to temperature. It is suggested that the difference reported by other workers in similar studies are probably found only when subjects examined are partially vasoconstricted, and reflect a more general process of adaptation to cold which results in a reduced vasoconstrictor fiber activity on exposure to a given thermal environment.},

Across 4 studies, the authors found that participants scoring in the bottom quartile on tests of humor, grammar, and logic grossly overestimated their test performance and ability. Although their test scores put them in the 12th percentile, they estimated themselves to be in the 62nd. Several analyses linked this miscalibration to deficits in metacognitive skill, or the capacity to distinguish accuracy from error. Paradoxically, improving the skills of the participants, and thus increasing their metacognitive competence, helped them recognize the limitations of their abilities.

The mean loss in body weight of 5.7 and 4.1 kg in groups I and II, respectively, was partitioned into the following losses in body compartments: group I, 1.24 kg fat and 4.47 kg fat-free body mass (including 0.90 kg dry protein); group II, 0.98 kg fat and 3.13 kg fat-free body mass (including 0.64 kg of dry protein).

The observed total body water (D2O dilution) decreased significantly in both groups; however, a greater loss of water was observed in group I. Predicted body water estimates were lower than the observed values. Estimates of the dry protein mass derived from urinary creatinine excretion and total body potassium were higher than observed values.

  abstract      = {Molecular (DNA) studies suggest that birds radiated rapidly in the wake of the Cretaceous{\textendash}Paleogene mass extinction (66 Ma), diversifying into nearly all the major groups we recognize today. However, fossil evidence for this pattern has been difficult to find because of the poor fossilization potential of small, delicate-boned birds. We report a tiny species of bird from \~{}62.5 million-year-old rocks in New Mexico. Tsidiiyazhi abini (Navajo for {\textquotedblleft}little morning bird{\textquotedblright}) is an ancient species of mousebird (Coliiformes). The fossil provides evidence that many groups of birds arose just a few million years after the mass extinction and had already begun evolving specializations of the foot for different ecological roles.Evidence is accumulating for a rapid diversification of birds following the K{\textendash}Pg extinction. Recent molecular divergence dating studies suggest that birds radiated explosively during the first few million years of the Paleocene; however, fossils from this interval remain poorly represented, hindering our understanding of morphological and ecological specialization in early neoavian birds. Here we report a small fossil bird from the Nacimiento Formation of New Mexico, constrained to 62.221{\textendash}62.517 Ma. This partial skeleton represents the oldest arboreal crown group bird known. Phylogenetic analyses recovered Tsidiiyazhi abini gen. et sp. nov. as a member of the Sandcoleidae, an extinct basal clade of stem mousebirds (Coliiformes). The discovery of Tsidiiyazhi pushes the minimum divergence ages of as many as nine additional major neoavian lineages into the earliest Paleocene, compressing the duration of the proposed explosive post{\textendash}K{\textendash}Pg radiation of modern birds into a very narrow temporal window parallel to that suggested for placental mammals. Simultaneously, Tsidiiyazhi provides evidence for the rapid morphological (and likely ecological) diversification of crown birds. Features of the foot indicate semizygodactyly (the ability to facultatively reverse the fourth pedal digit), and the arcuate arrangement of the pedal trochleae bears a striking resemblance to the conformation in owls (Strigiformes). Inclusion of fossil taxa and branch length estimates impacts ancestral state reconstructions, revealing support for the independent evolution of semizygodactyly in Coliiformes, Leptosomiformes, and Strigiformes, none of which is closely related to extant clades exhibiting full zygodactyly.},

Background
Fish is one of the most allergenic foods. While clinical cross-reactivity among different fishes is a widely accepted feature of fish allergy, associations with other food allergies are not well understood. This study aims at analyzing the relevance of clinical cross-reactivity between fish and chicken meat in patients with allergy to chicken meat without sensitization to hen's eggs.

Methods
Patients with food allergy to fish and chicken meat (n = 29) or chicken meat only (n = 7) were recruited. IgE-reactive chicken proteins were identified (Edman, MS analysis) and quantified (ELISA). Allergens were used in IgE ELISA and skin testing.

Results
Chicken parvalbumin and two new allergens, aldolase and enolase, were identified at 12, 40, and 50 kDa, respectively. They were recognized by sIgE of 61%, 75%, and 83% of all patient sera which were in the majority of the cases positive for the fish homologues as well. Fish and chicken meat allergens were highly cross-reactive while high inhibition rates with fish or chicken allergens correlated with the patients' primary sensitization to fish or chicken. In cooked or roasted foods, enolase and aldolase were detectable in chicken breast while parvalbumin was detectable in chicken legs and wings.

Conclusions
Fish and chicken meat are cross-reactive foods; both fish-allergic and chicken meat-allergic patients might be at risk of developing a food allergy to chicken meat or to fish, respectively. This clinical phenomenon is proposed to be termed âfishâchicken syndromeâ with cross-reactive allergens involved being parvalbumins, enolases, and aldolases.

We find that a population that diverged early from other modern humans in Africa contributed genetically to the ancestors of Neanderthals from the Altai Mountains roughly 100,000 years ago. By contrast, we do not detect such a genetic contribution in the Denisovan or the two European Neanderthals. We conclude that in addition to later interbreeding events, the ancestors of Neanderthals from the Altai Mountains and early modern humans met and interbred, possibly in the Near East, many thousands of years earlier than previously thought.},

  abstract      = {Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) infections are highly prevalent in developing countries where clinical presentations range from asymptomatic colonization to severe cholera-like illness. The molecular basis for these varied presentations, that may involve strain-specific virulence features as well as host factors, have not been elucidated. We demonstrate that when challenged with ETEC strain H10407, originally isolated from a case of cholera-like illness, blood group A human volunteers developed severe diarrhea more frequently than individuals from other blood groups. Interestingly, a diverse population of ETEC strains, including H10407, secrete a novel adhesin molecule, EtpA. As many bacterial adhesins also agglutinate red blood cells, we combined the use of glycan arrays, biolayer inferometry, and non-canonical amino acid labeling with hemagglutination studies to demonstrate that EtpA is a dominant ETEC blood group A specific lectin/hemagglutinin. Importantly, we also show that EtpA interacts specifically with glycans expressed on intestinal epithelial cells from blood group A individuals, and that EtpA-mediated bacterial-host interactions accelerate bacterial adhesion and the effective delivery both heat-labile and heat-stable toxins of ETEC. Collectively, these data provide additional insight into the complex molecular basis of severe ETEC diarrheal illness that may inform rational design of vaccines to protect those at highest risk.},

Computational models emphasize the potential role of the hippocampus in novelty detection, its unique anatomical circuitry making it ideally suited to act as a comparator between past and present experience. The hippocampus, therefore, is viewed to detect associative mismatches between what is expected based on retrieval of past experience and current sensory input. However, direct evidence that the human hippocampus performs such operations is lacking. We explored brain responses to novel sequences of objects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), while subjects performed an incidental target detection task. Our results demonstrate that hippocampal activation was maximal when prior predictions concerning which object would appear next in a sequence were violated by sensory reality. In so doing, we establish the biological reality of associative match-mismatch computations within the human hippocampus, a process widely held to play a cardinal role in novelty detection. Our results also suggest that the hippocampus may generate predictions about how future events will unfold, and critically detect when these expectancies are violated, even when task demands do not require it. The present study also offers broader insights into the nature of essential computations carried out by the hippocampus, which may also underpin its unique contribution to episodic memory.},

Although RSODs reveal a lower life solitary RSODs satisfaction generally and tend to have more depressive moods, are even less satisfied and more depressive. In addition, the latter tend to have lower self-esteem and are more often victims of bullying. Conclusions RSODs are not a homogeneous group of adolescents and preventive efforts, such as competence-enhancing and social resistance programmes, should be applied in accordance with the constellation of associated problems: solitary RSODs appear to be socially inhibited, depressive and often victims of bullying, whereas social RSODs appear to be socially accepted but are prone to be violent offenders.

  abstract      = {Organismal functions are size-dependent whenever body surfaces supply body volumes. Larger organisms can develop strongly folded internal surfaces for enhanced diffusion, but in many cases areas cannot be folded so that their enlargement is constrained by anatomy, presenting a problem for larger animals. Here, we study the allometry of adhesive pad area in 225 climbing animal species, covering more than seven orders of magnitude in weight. Across all taxa, adhesive pad area showed extreme positive allometry and scaled with weight, implying a 200-fold increase of relative pad area from mites to geckos. However, allometric scaling coefficients for pad area systematically decreased with taxonomic level, and were close to isometry when evolutionary history was accounted for, indicating that the substantial anatomical changes required to achieve increases in relative pad area are limited by phylogenetic constraints. Using a comparative phylogenetic approach, we found that the departure from isometry is almost exclusively caused by large differences in size-corrected pad area between arthropods and vertebrates. To mitigate the expected decrease of weight-specific adhesion within closely related taxa where pad area scaled close to isometry, data for several taxa suggest that the pads{\textquoteright} adhesive strength increased for larger animals. The combination of adjustments in relative pad area for distantly related taxa and changes in adhesive strength for closely related groups helps explain how climbing with adhesive pads has evolved in animals varying over seven orders of magnitude in body weight. Our results illustrate the size limits of adhesion-based climbing, with profound implications for large-scale bio-inspired adhesives.},

  abstract      = {Various studies have demonstrated that a night of sleep has a beneficial effect on the
retention of previously acquired declarative material. In two experiments, we addressed
the question of whether this effect extends to daytime naps. In the first experiment we
assessed free recall of a list of 30 words after a 60 min retention interval that was either
filled with daytime napping or waking activity. Memory performance was significantly
enhanced after napping as opposed to waking but was not correlated with time spent in
slow wave sleep or total sleep time within the napping condition. The second
experiment was designed to clarify the role of total sleep time and therefore included an
additional third group, which was allowed to nap for no longer than 6 min on average.
In comparing word recall after conditions of no napping (waking), short napping, and
long napping, we found superior recall for both nap conditions in contrast to waking as
well as for long naps in contrast to short naps. These results demonstrate that even an
ultra short period of sleep is sufficient to enhance memory processing. We suggest that
the mere onset of sleep may initiate active processes of consolidation which – once
triggered – remain effective even if sleep is terminated shortly thereafter.

The conceptual framework of evolutionary biology emerged with the Modern Synthesis in the early twentieth century and has since expanded into a highly successful research program to explore the processes of diversification and adaptation. Nonetheless, the ability of that framework satisfactorily to accommodate the rapid advances in developmental biology, genomics and ecology has been questioned. We review some of these arguments, focusing on literatures (evo-devo, developmental plasticity, inclusive inheritance and niche construction) whose implications for evolution can be interpreted in two ways{\textemdash}one that preserves the internal structure of contemporary evolutionary theory and one that points towards an alternative conceptual framework. The latter, which we label the {\textquoteleft}extended evolutionary synthesis{\textquoteright} (EES), retains the fundaments of evolutionary theory, but differs in its emphasis on the role of constructive processes in development and evolution, and reciprocal portrayals of causation. In the EES, developmental processes, operating through developmental bias, inclusive inheritance and niche construction, share responsibility for the direction and rate of evolution, the origin of character variation and organism{\textendash}environment complementarity. We spell out the structure, core assumptions and novel predictions of the EES, and show how it can be deployed to stimulate and advance research in those fields that study or use evolutionary biology.},

  abstract      = {Objective: Light therapy and antidepressants
have shown comparable efficacy in
separate studies of seasonal affective disorder
treatment, but few studies have directly
compared the two treatments. This
study compared the effectiveness of light
therapy and an antidepressant within a
single trial.
Method: This double-blind, randomized,
controlled trial was conducted in four Canadian
centers over three winter seasons.
Patients met DSM–IV criteria for major depressive
disorder with a seasonal (winter)
pattern and had scores ≥23 on the 24-
item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale.
After a baseline observation week, eligible
patients were randomly assigned to 8
weeks of double-blind treatment with either
1) 10,000-lux light treatment and a
placebo capsule, or 2) 100-lux light treatment
(placebo light) and fluoxetine, 20
mg/day. Light treatment was applied for
30 minutes/day in the morning with a fluorescent
white-light box; placebo light
boxes used neutral density filters.
Results: A total of 96 patients were randomly
assigned to a treatment condition.
Intent-to-treat analysis showed overall
improvement with time, with no differences
between treatments. There were
also no differences between the light and
fluoxetine treatment groups in clinical response
rates (67% for each group) or remission
rates (50% and 54%, respectively).
Post hoc testing found that light-treated
patients had greater improvement at 1
week but not at other time points. Fluoxetine
was associated with greater treatment-emergent
adverse events (agitation,
sleep disturbance, palpitations), but both
treatments were generally well-tolerated
with no differences in overall number of
adverse effects.
Conclusions: Light treatment showed
earlier response onset and lower rate of
some adverse events relative to fluoxetine,
but there were no other significant
differences in outcome between light
therapy and antidepressant medication.
Although limited by lack of a double-placebo
condition, this study supports the effectiveness
and tolerability of both treatments
for seasonal affective disorder and
suggests that other clinical factors, including
patient preference, should guide selection
of first-line treatment.},

the oceanic mercury inventory by 36–1,313 million moles since the
1500s2–9. Such predictions have remained largely untested owing to
a lack of appropriate historical data and natural archives. Here we
report oceanographic measurements of total dissolved mercury and
related parameters from several recent expeditions to theAtlantic, Pacific,
Southern and Arctic oceans. We find that deep North Atlantic
waters and most intermediate waters are anomalously enriched in
mercury relative to the deep waters of the South Atlantic, Southern
and Pacific oceans, probably as a result of the incorporation of anthropogenic
mercury. We estimate the total amount of anthropogenicmercury
presentin the global ocean to be 2906 80millionmoles,
with almost two-thirds residing in water shallower than a thousand
metres. Our findings suggest that anthropogenic perturbations to the
globalmercury cycle haveled to an approximately 150 per centincrease
in the amount of mercuryin thermocline waters and have tripled the
mercury content of surface waters compared to pre-anthropogenic
conditions. Thisinformation may aid our understanding of the processes
and the depths at which inorganic mercury species are converted
into toxic methyl mercury and subsequently bioaccumulated
in marine food webs.},

Fifty consecutive new cardiology clinic patients who were on statin drug therapy (for an average of 28 months) on their initial visit were evaluated for possible adverse statin effects (myalgia, fatigue, dyspnea, memory loss, and peripheral neuropathy). All patients discontinued statin therapy due to side effects and began supplemental CoQ10 at an average of 240 mg/day upon initial visit. Patients have been followed for an average of 22 months with 84% of the patients followed now for more than 12 months. The prevalence of patient symptoms on initial visit and on most recent follow-up demonstrated a decrease in fatigue from 84% to 16%, myalgia from 64% to 6%, dyspnea from 58% to 12%, memory loss from 8% to 4% and peripheral neuropathy from 10% to 2%. There were two deaths from lung cancer and one death from aortic stenosis with no strokes or myocardial infarctions. Measurements of heart function either improved or remained stable in the majority of patients. We conclude that statin-related side effects, including statin cardiomyopathy, are far more common than previously published and are reversible with the combination of statin discontinuation and supplemental CoQ10. We saw no adverse consequences from statin discontinuation. Keywords: Statin cardiomyopathy, coenzyme Q10, CoQ10, ubiquinone, statins, statin side effects, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors},

Residents were randomised to two counter-balanced groups which either took tests on status epilepticus and studied a review sheet on myasthenia gravis (SE-T/MG-S group) or took tests on myasthenia gravis and studied a review sheet on status epilepticus (MG-T/SE-S group). Testing and studying occurred immediately after teaching and then at two additional times at intervals of about 2Â weeks. Residents received feedback after each test. Tests consisted of short-answer questions and the review sheets consisted of information identical to that on the answer sheets for the tests. At about 6Â months residents took a final test on both topics.Resultsâ Nineteen residents in the SE-T/MG-S group and 21 residents in the MG-T/SE-S group completed the study. Collapsing across groups, repeated testing produced final test scores that were an average of 13% higher than those produced by repeated study (39% versus 26%) at >Â 6Â months after the initial teaching session (t[78]Â =Â 3.93, standard error of the differenceÂ =Â 0.03, PÂ <Â 0.001, dÂ =Â 0.91).Conclusionsâ Repeated testing with feedback appears to result in significantly greater long-term retention of information taught in a didactic conference than repeated, spaced study.

Energy restriction and adherence required
for weight loss without surgery
Non-surgical weight loss treatment has not been shown
to reduce mortality or cardiovascular morbidity, but can
prevent diabetes mellitus and improves cardiovascular
risk factors. For weight loss, energy restriction is
fundamental and can lead to an average 2 to 20 kg
loss over 6 to 12 months. Pharmacological treatment,
behaviour therapy, physical activity and weight loss
advice through web sites and smartphone applications
and combinations in addition to energy restriction
can contribute to further, but relatively limited weight
loss up to 30 months. Adherence to the treatment is
necessary for both weight loss and long-term weight
loss maintenance.},

  abstract      = {daptation is an aspect of virtually all questions of human biology. Besides their interest in evolution through adaptive selection of the primates, including man, physical anthropologists are concerned with biological adaptability as a human attribute. In this sense adaptation has been examined at three overlapping levels: (i) those represented by differences in the extent of inherent capacities in subpopulations long exposed to different conditions, such as differences in the inherited determinants of body form and skin pigment in peoples in different climatic zones; (ii) adaptations acquired during the growth period of the individual such as residual stunting and reduced caloric needs in individuals receiving low caloric diets throughout childhood; and (iii) reversible acclimatization to the immediate conditions such as the changes which make it easier to work at high altitudes after the first few days there. Greater resilience to change is achieved if adaptations are reversible in each generation or within a lifetime. This implies an evolutionary tendency to shift human adaptability from genetic selection to ontogenetic plasticity to reversible adaptability.},

Structure and property changes resulted almost independent of the different treatments and were followed by Fourier transform infrared analysis (FTIR), thermogravimetry (TG), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), insoluble determination and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). The initial phase of drying consists of the autoxidation phenomenon of the unsaturated fatty acid components with the development of extensive cross-linking, together with formation of conjugated unsaturations. The following stage of slow consumption of labile cross-links gives rise to a highly stable network, which contains small amounts of low molecular weight molecules, either formed by fragmentation or still present as unreacted triglycerides. The oxidative degradation of linseed oil consists of the continuation of the hardening process, and only for long periods of artificial ageing, corresponding to years of natural ageing, the oxidation also takes place on the alkylic segments, leading to partial fragmentation of the structure.},

It has been proposed that this cognitive paralysis occurs due to temporal and cognitive constraints on survival response times while leaving open the question of which cognitive component is implicated in this behavior. This paper proposes, firstly, that the temporal constraints which occur during an emergency inhibit the functioning of the supervisory attentional system (SAS), which leads to the victim showing: 1) an appropriate response, if trained; 2) stereotypical or otherwise irrational behavior, if untrained; or 3) cognitive paralysis. Secondly, that the main role of the SAS is to operate as a temporal buffer, enabling a survival response to be prepared prior to facing a life-threatening event and not as a real-time immediate responder. It is argued that the initial cognitive paralysis differs at the cognitive and neurological levels from the more prolonged hypoactive behavior commonly seen in victims rescued from disasters and which is considered to be a form of disassociative reaction.},

Compared to a baseline condition and control group those undergoing environmental duress showed significant impairment in selective and sustained attention which taken together suggests dysfunction in controlled attention. No impairment was found in either attentional switching or auditoryâverbal working memory. It is argued that this type of cognitive impairment makes flexible interaction with the survival environment difficult and the victim's behaviour becomes dominated by environmental cues at the expense of wilful, goalâdirected survival behaviour.

  abstract      = {Achieving sustainable crop production while feeding an increasing world population is one of the most ambitious challenges of this century1. Meeting this challenge will necessarily imply a drastic reduction of adverse environmental effects arising from agricultural activities2. The reduction of pesticide use is one of the critical drivers to preserve the environment and human health. Pesticide use could be reduced through the adoption of new production strategies3,​4,​5; however, whether substantial reductions of pesticide use are possible without impacting crop productivity and profitability is debatable6,​7,​8,​9,​10,​11,​12,​13,​14,​15,​16,​17. Here, we demonstrated that low pesticide use rarely decreases productivity and profitability in arable farms. We analysed the potential conflicts between pesticide use and productivity or profitability with data from 946 non-organic arable commercial farms showing contrasting levels of pesticide use and covering a wide range of production situations in France. We failed to detect any conflict between low pesticide use and both high productivity and high profitability in 77% of the farms. We estimated that total pesticide use could be reduced by 42% without any negative effects on both productivity and profitability in 59% of farms from our national network. This corresponded to an average reduction of 37, 47 and 60% of herbicide, fungicide and insecticide use, respectively. The potential for reducing pesticide use appeared higher in farms with currently high pesticide use than in farms with low pesticide use. Our results demonstrate that pesticide reduction is already accessible to farmers in most production situations. This would imply profound changes in market organization and trade balance.},

This study tested the hypothesis that the number of CD34+ cells in the blood would increase after eccentric exercise of the elbow flexors, but decrease in recovery, and the magnitude of the changes would be dependent on the magnitude of muscle damage. Methods Nine men (28.0Â Â±Â 6.6 years) performed exercises consisting of 10 sets of six maximal voluntary eccentric contractions of the elbow flexors with their non-dominant arm. Six of them performed the same exercise with the same arm 4 weeks later. Changes in indirect markers of muscle damage were measured before, within 10Â min after, and at 24, 48, 72, and 96Â h after eccentric exercise. Differential leukocyte counts (total leukocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes) and CD34+ cells in the blood were measured before, immediately after, and at 2, 24, 48, 72, and 96Â h following the exercises. Results After eccentric exercise, significant (pÂ &lt;Â 0.05) decreases in maximal voluntary isometric contraction torque and increases in delayed onset muscle soreness and plasma creatine kinase activity were observed. However, no significant changes in leukocytes and CD34+ cells were evident. The changes in muscle damage markers were significantly (pÂ &lt;Â 0.05) smaller following the second exercise session as compared with the first exercise session, but the changes in leukocytes and CD34+ cells were not significantly different between sessions. Conclusion These results did not support the hypothesis, and showed that eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage to the elbow flexors did not influence the number of circulating CD34+ cells. },

In humans, exposure to PCAHs is aimed chiefly at epithelial cells residing in the intestinal mucosa, because oral intake of contaminated food is a major source of PCAHs. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to examine the effects of chronic exposure to various PCAHs [i.e. 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran (PeCDF), 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB-126), and 2,2'4,4'5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB-153)], given alone or as mixtures, on intestinal cholecystokinin (CCK) peptide and messenger RNA levels. We show that chronic PCAH treatment significantly lowers intestinal levels of stored CCK peptide. Intestinal CCK messenger RNA levels are not affected. In addition, 3,3',4,4',5pentachlorobiphenyl treatment increased intestinal insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 levels in a dose-related manner. Acute 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin treatment of intestinal CCK cells lowered levels of CCK-processing enzymes (i.e. prohormone convertase-1 and -2). Together, these data indicate that PCAHs may decrease intestinal levels of stored CCK peptide by affecting the intestinal insulin-like growth factor system and CCK processing. },

camp or while hiking are the leading contributing factors. The most common illnesses are gastrointestinal
symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (26.4%) and all flu-like illness, including
flu symptoms and respiratory symptoms (16.6%). Rock fall was the leading near-miss incident. Two
hundred fifty-seven (53%) medical evacuees received treatment and were able to rejoin and finish
their course. There was one fatality from 1999 to 2002. The fatality rate for this period is 0.002 per
1000 program days.
Conclusions.—The number of injuries and, specifically, the number of athletic injuries have declined.
The number and rate of near-miss incidents increased as a result of better reporting; the rate
of nonmedical incidents held steady. Motivation continues to be our leading category of nonmedical
incident. Efforts at collecting incident data provide a useful measurement from which we can gauge
our risk-management performance.

A conflict situation was set up in which subjects were given instructions that described one procedure and an example that described another procedure. The effectiveness of example and instruction information was measured by looking at which procedure subjects used. In the six experiments reported, most of the subjects consistently used the example information and disregarded the instructions. This example effect was not the result of the order of the instruction and example information, nor was it a result of the nature of information in the instructions and example. When the instruction information was stressed as very important, the example effect was attenuated but not eliminated. The results suggest that subjects may not fully process instructions because they believe that examples are more useful and important. },

Roads and traffic greatly affect animals{\textquoteright} mortality not only through habitat structure modifications but also through direct mortality owing to collisions. Although species are known to differ in their sensitivity to the risk of collision, whether individuals can change their behaviour in response to this is still unknown. Here, we tested whether common European birds changed their flight initiation distances (FIDs) in response to vehicles according to road speed limit (a known factor affecting killing rates on roads) and vehicle speed. We found that FID increased with speed limit, although vehicle speed had no effect. This suggests that birds adjust their flight distance to speed limit, which may reduce collision risks and decrease mortality maximizing the time allocated to foraging behaviours. Mobility and territory size are likely to affect an individuals{\textquoteright} ability to respond adaptively to local speed limits.},

  abstract      = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are generated from aerobic metabolism, as a result of accidental electron leakage as well as regulated enzymatic processes. Because ROS/RNS can induce oxidative injury and act in redox signaling, enzymes metabolizing them will inherently promote either health or disease, depending on the physiological context. It is thus misleading to consider conventionally called antioxidant enzymes to be largely, if not exclusively, health protective. Because such a notion is nonetheless common, we herein attempt to rationalize why this simplistic view should be avoided. First we give an updated summary of physiological phenotypes triggered in mouse models of overexpression or knockout of major antioxidant enzymes. Subsequently, we focus on a series of striking cases that demonstrate âparadoxicalâ outcomes, i.e., increased fitness upon deletion of antioxidant enzymes or disease triggered by their overexpression. We elaborate mechanisms by which these phenotypes are mediated via chemical, biological, and metabolic interactions of the antioxidant enzymes with their substrates, downstream events, and cellular context. Furthermore, we propose that novel treatments of antioxidant enzyme-related human diseases may be enabled by deliberate targeting of dual roles of the pertaining enzymes. We also discuss the potential of âantioxidantâ nutrients and phytochemicals, via regulating the expression or function of antioxidant enzymes, in preventing, treating, or aggravating chronic diseases. We conclude that âparadoxicalâ roles of antioxidant enzymes in physiology, health, and disease derive from sophisticated molecular mechanisms of redox biology and metabolic homeostasis. Simply viewing antioxidant enzymes as always being beneficial is not only conceptually misleading but also clinically hazardous if such notions underpin medical treatment protocols based on modulation of redox pathways.},

Substances to be tested were dissolved in acetone and added to separated spermatozoa in culture media to final concentrations of 100 and 1000 Î¼M. Aliquots were removed immediately (<5 min.) and 24 hr after the addition and tested for sperm motility characteristics. Four of the substances tested; 2,4,7âtrinitrofluorenâ9âone (2,4,7âtNFO), 2,sâdiaminofluorene (2,5âdAF), 7âhydroxyâ2ânitrofluorene (7âOHâNF) and 2,7âdiaminofluorene (2,7âdAF) showed strong detrimental effects on the sperm motility. Slight detrimental effects were also recorded using 2ânitrofluorene and 2,5âdinitrofluorene (2,5âdNF). Weak stimulatory effects were obtained using 2âacetoamidofluorene (AAF) and 2,7âdinitrofluorene (2,7âdNF). No significant effects were seen with 5âhydroxyâ2ânitrofluorene (5âOHâNF), 2âaminofluorene (AF), 2âaminofluorenâ9âone (AFO), 2âaminoâ9âhydroxyfluorene (9âOHâAF) or 9âhydroxyâ2ânitrofluorene (9âOHâNF). The mechanism behind this effect is not known but it could be speculated that these lipophilic substances interact with the membranes or the cellular respiration.},

an accelerating decline of the world’s stocks of biological diversity at
rates 100 to 1,000 times pre-human levels 2 . Historically, low-impact
intrusion into species habitats arose from local demands for food,
fuel and living space 3 . However, in today’s increasingly globalized
economy, international trade chains accelerate habitat degradation
far removed from the place of consumption. Although adverse
effects of economic prosperity and economic inequality have been
confirmed 4,5 , the importance of international trade as a driver of
threats to species is poorly understood. Here we show that a signifi-
cant number of species are threatened as a result of international
trade along complex routes, and that, in particular, consumers in
developed countries cause threats to species through their demand of
commodities that are ultimately produced in developing countries.
We linked 25,000 Animalia species threat records from the
International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List to more
than 15,000 commodities produced in 187 countries and evaluated
more than 5 billion supply chains in terms of their biodiversity
impacts. Excluding invasive species, we found that 30% of global
species threats are due to international trade. In many developed
countries, the consumption of imported coffee, tea, sugar, textiles,
fish and other manufactured items causes a biodiversity footprint
that is larger abroad than at home. Our results emphasize the
importance of examining biodiversity loss as a global systemic phe-
nomenon, instead of looking at the degrading or polluting producers
in isolation. We anticipate that our findings will facilitate better
regulation, sustainable supply-chain certification and consumer
product labelling},

Here, we quantify tourism-related global carbon flows between 160 countries, and their carbon footprints under origin and destination accounting perspectives. We find that, between 2009 and 2013, tourismâs global carbon footprint has increased from 3.9 to 4.5âGtCO2e, four times more than previously estimated, accounting for about 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Transport, shopping and food are significant contributors. The majority of this footprint is exerted by and in high-income countries. The rapid increase in tourism demand is effectively outstripping the decarbonization of tourism-related technology. We project that, due to its high carbon intensity and continuing growth, tourism will constitute a growing part of the worldâs greenhouse gas emissions.},

It was produced from 32 million random DNA fragments, sequenced by Sanger dideoxy technology and assembled into 4,528 scaffolds, comprising 2,810 million bases (Mb) of contiguous sequence with approximately 7.5-fold coverage for any given region. We developed a modified version of the Celera assembler to facilitate the identification and comparison of alternate alleles within this individual diploid genome. Comparison of this genome and the National Center for Biotechnology Information human reference assembly revealed more than 4.1 million DNA variants, encompassing 12.3 Mb. These variants (of which 1,288,319 were novel) included 3,213,401 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 53,823 block substitutions (2206 bp), 292,102 heterozygous insertion/deletion events (indels)(1571 bp), 559,473 homozygous indels (182,711 bp), 90 inversions, as well as numerous segmental duplications and copy number variation regions. Non-SNP DNA variation accounts for 22% of all events identified in the donor, however they involve 74% of all variant bases. This suggests an important role for non-SNP genetic alterations in defining the diploid genome structure. Moreover, 44% of genes were heterozygous for one or more variants. Using a novel haplotype assembly strategy, we were able to span 1.5 Gb of genome sequence in segments >200 kb, providing further precision to the diploid nature of the genome. These data depict a definitive molecular portrait of a diploid human genome that provides a starting point for future genome comparisons and enables an era of individualized genomic information.},

  abstract      = {Identification of common mechanistic principles that shed light on the action of the many chemically diverse toxicants to which we are exposed is of central importance in understanding how toxicants disrupt normal cellular function and in developing more effective means of protecting against such effects. Of particular importance is identifying mechanisms operative at environmentally relevant toxicant exposure levels. Chemically diverse toxicants exhibit striking convergence, at environmentally relevant exposure levels, on pathway-specific disruption of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling required for cell division in central nervous system (CNS) progenitor cells. Relatively small toxicant-induced increases in oxidative status are associated with Fyn kinase activation, leading to secondary activation of the c-Cbl ubiquitin ligase. Fyn/c-Cbl pathway activation by these pro-oxidative changes causes specific reductions, in vitro and in vivo, in levels of the c-Cbl target platelet-derived growth factor receptor- and other c-Cbl targets, but not of the TrkC RTK (which is not a c-Cbl target). Sequential Fyn and c-Cbl activation, with consequent pathway-specific suppression of RTK signaling, is induced by levels of methylmercury and lead that affect large segments of the population, as well as by paraquat, an organic herbicide. Our results identify a novel regulatory pathway of oxidant-mediated Fyn/c-Cbl activation as a shared mechanism of action of chemically diverse toxicants at environmentally relevant levels, and as a means by which increased oxidative status may disrupt mitogenic signaling. These results provide one of a small number of general mechanistic principles in toxicology, and the only such principle integrating toxicology, precursor cell biology, redox biology, and signaling pathway analysis in a predictive framework of broad potential relevance to the understanding of pro-oxidantmediated disruption of normal development.},

Compared with oral contraceptives containing levonorgestrel and with the same dose of oestrogen and length of use, the rate ratio for oral contraceptives with norethisterone was 0.98 (0.71 to 1.37), with norgestimate 1.19 (0.96 to 1.47), with desogestrel 1.82 (1.49 to 2.22), with gestodene 1.86 (1.59 to 2.18), with drospirenone 1.64 (1.27 to 2.10), and with cyproterone 1.88 (1.47 to 2.42). Compared with non-users of oral contraceptives, the rate ratio for venous thromboembolism in users of progestogen only oral contraceptives with levonorgestrel or norethisterone was 0.59 (0.33 to 1.03) or with 75 Î¼g desogestrel was 1.12 (0.36 to 3.49), and for hormone releasing intrauterine devices was 0.90 (0.64 to 1.26).Conclusion The risk of venous thrombosis in current users of combined oral contraceptives decreases with duration of use and decreasing oestrogen dose. For the same dose of oestrogen and the same length of use, oral contraceptives with desogestrel, gestodene, or drospirenone were associated with a significantly higher risk of venous thrombosis than oral contraceptives with levonorgestrel. Progestogen only pills and hormone releasing intrauterine devices were not associated with any increased risk of venous thrombosis.},

  abstract      = { Endurance running may be a derived capability of the genus Homo and may have been instrumental in the evolution of the human body form. Two hypotheses have been presented to explain why early Homo would have needed to run long distances: scavenging and persistence hunting. Persistence hunting takes place during the hottest time of the day and involves chasing an animal until it is run to exhaustion. A critical factor is the fact that humans can keep their bodies cool by sweating while running. Another critical factor is the ability to track down an animal. Endurance running may have had adaptive value not only in scavenging but also in persistence hunting. Before the domestication of dogs, persistence hunting may have been one of the most efficient forms of hunting and may therefore have been crucial in the evolution of humans. },

  abstract      = {Ethanol abuse produces fatty liver which cannot be prevented by supplementation in protein, minerals, vitamins, and choline. In rats, protein and choline deficiencies potentiate the effect, whereas replacement of dietary fat by medium chain triglycerides or carbohydrates decreases the capacity of ethanol to produce steatosis. Administration of a single dose of ethanol to rats represents a stressful condition associated with moderate hepatic accumulation of fatty acids derived from adipose tissue. By contrast, chronic ethanol administration produces more pronounced steatosis with a predominance of endogenously synthesized and, when available, dietary fatty acids. These accumulate because of decreased fat oxidation. Ethanol also stimulates hepatic lipogenesis. These various effects can be explained by the increase in the hepatic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ratio secondary to the oxidation of ethanol via the alcohol dehydrogenase pathway. In addition there are more lasting changes in intermediary metabolism, such as increased hepatic ketogenesis which could be linked to the persistent alteration in mitochondrial function and structure found after chronic ethanol ingestion. The ultrastructural changes also are characterized by proliferation of the hepatic smooth endoplasmic reticulum. The latter was documented by subfraction. This led to the description of a new pathway for ethanol metabolism, the microsomal ethanol oxidizing system, which doubles in activity after ethanol feeding. The existence of the microsomal ethanol oxidizing system may contribute to our understanding of increased cholesterol and lipoprotein synthesis. Other effects upon lipid metabolism include decreases in free fatty acids and glycerol concentrations and free fatty acid turnover which result from inhibition of peripheral fat mobilization by acetate, a metabolite of ethanol.},

  abstract      = {Humans have engaged in endurance running for millions of years1, but the modern running shoe was not invented until the 1970s. For most of human evolutionary history, runners were either barefoot or wore minimal footwear such as sandals or moccasins with smaller heels and little cushioning relative to modern running shoes. We wondered how runners coped with the impact caused by the foot colliding with the ground before the invention of the modern shoe. Here we show that habitually barefoot endurance runners often land on the fore-foot (fore-foot strike) before bringing down the heel, but they sometimes land with a flat foot (mid-foot strike) or, less often, on the heel (rear-foot strike). In contrast, habitually shod runners mostly rear-foot strike, facilitated by the elevated and cushioned heel of the modern running shoe. Kinematic and kinetic analyses show that even on hard surfaces, barefoot runners who fore-foot strike generate smaller collision forces than shod rear-foot strikers. This difference results primarily from a more plantarflexed foot at landing and more ankle compliance during impact, decreasing the effective mass of the body that collides with the ground. Fore-foot- and mid-foot-strike gaits were probably more common when humans ran barefoot or in minimal shoes, and may protect the feet and lower limbs from some of the impact-related injuries now experienced by a high percentage of runners.},

  abstract      = {Under what circumstances speciation in sexually reproducing animals can occur without geographical disjunction is still controversial. According to the ring-species model, a reproductive barrier may arise through 'isolation by distance' when peripheral populations of a species meet after expanding around some uninhabitable barrier. The classical example of this kind of speciation is the herring gull (Larus argentatus) complex, with a circumpolar distribution in the Northern Hemisphere. Based on mitochondrial DNA variation among 21 gull taxa, we show that members of this complex differentiated largely in allopatry following multiple vicariance and long-distance-colonization events, not primarily through isolation by distance. Reproductive isolation evolved more rapidly between some lineages than between others, irrespective of their genetic distance. Extant taxa are the result of divergent as well as reticulate evolution between two ancestral lineages originally separated in a North Atlantic refugium and a continental Eurasian refugium, respectively. Continental birds expanded along the entire north Eurasian coast and via Beringia into North America. Contrary to the ring-species model, we find no genetic evidence for a closure of the circumpolar ring through colonization of Europe by North American herring gulls. However, closure of the ring in the opposite direction may be imminent, with lesser black-backed gulls about to colonize North America.},

  abstract      = {Sleep deprivation severely compromises the ability of human beings to respond to stimuli in a timely fashion. These deficits have been attributed in large part to failures of vigilant attention, which many theorists believe forms the bedrock of the other more complex components of cognition. One of the leading paradigms used as an assay of vigilant attention is the psychomotor vigilance test (PVT), a high signal-load reaction-time test that is extremely sensitive to sleep deprivation. Over the last twenty years, four dominant findings have emerged from the use of this paradigm. First, sleep deprivation results in an overall slowing of responses. Second, sleep deprivation increases the propensity of individuals to lapse for lengthy periods (>500Â ms), as well as make errors of commission. Third, sleep deprivation enhances the time-on-task effect within each test bout. Finally, PVT results during extended periods of wakefulness reveal the presence of interacting circadian and homeostatic sleep drives. A theme that links these findings is the interplay of âtop-downâ and âbottom-upâ attention in producing the unstable and unpredictable patterns of behavior that are the hallmark of the sleep-deprived state.},

Review:
I debattboken L{\"{a}}rarens {\r{a}}terkomst ger pedagogikprofessorn och spelforskaren Jonas Linderoth uppr{\"{a}}ttelse till den svenska l{\"{a}}rark{\r{a}}ren. De l{\"{a}}rare som tror p{\r{a}} att undervisa har under l{\r{a}}ng tid demoniserats av politiker, skolforskare, fackf{\"{o}}rbund och l{\"{a}}rarutbildare. Detta menar f{\"{o}}rfattaren {\"{a}}r en av orsakerna till Sveriges l{\"{a}}rarbrist och en delf{\"{o}}rklaring till svensk skolas stora problem. Idéer om att elever l{\"{a}}r sig b{\"{a}}st n{\"{a}}r de s{\"{o}}ker kunskap p{\r{a}} egen hand, att man inte b{\"{o}}r dela in skolan i olika {\"{a}}mnen och att all kunskap endast {\"{a}}r konstruktioner har skadat l{\"{a}}raryrkets sj{\"{a}}lva k{\"{a}}rna.

Even though the programs are conducted in the same context and are highly similar if characterized according to established research frameworks, our results suggest that they differ in their impact on student achievement. We therefore develop an analytical framework that allow us to characterize the programsâ content and delivery in detail. Through this approach, we identify important differences between the programs that provide explanatory value in discussing reasons for their differing impacts. },

Since the discovery of the salamander chytrid pathogen [Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans (Bsal)] (1), the world has been preoccupied with determining where it does and does not occur (2) so that policies can be implemented to prevent introduction into unaffected areas (3). Pathogenic chytrids cause chytridiomycosis, a disease of the skin that can cause mortality and die-offs, including population declines and species extinctions. In the United States—the world's biodiversity hot spot for salamanders and currently free of Bsal—a multinational scientific task force has been created to test the susceptibility of native species and to prepare an emergency response should Bsal be detected (4). Meanwhile, attention to Bsal's better-known cousin B. dendrobatidis (Bd), another chytrid pathogen that has decimated amphibian populations around the world, has faded, in part because of perceptions that once Bd is present, conservation actions and policy options are limited. On page 621 of this issue, O'Hanlon et al. (5) remind us that Bd remains a serious threat to global amphibian biodiversity and clarify where and when Bd came from and how it spread.

Methods University students from the Mainland (nÂ =Â 191) and Hong Kong (nÂ =Â 194) of China participated in this study. Factorial validity, discriminant validity, nomological validity, internal reliability, and measurement invariance across sample of the C-BREQ-2 were examined. Results Confirmatory factor analysis provided support for the factorial validity of the 18-item, 5-factor structure C-BREQ-2. Examination of the 95% confidence interval of the inter-factor correlations suggested that the C-BREQ-2 assesses related but distinct constructs, which provided support for its discriminant validity. The internal consistency reliability of the C-BREQ-2 was found acceptable. Examination of the pattern of inter-factor correlations between different regulations suggested that a simplex-like pattern was displayed, which provided evidence for the nomological validity of C-BREQ-2. The results from multi-group confirmatory factor analysis suggested that the factor loadings and variances/covariances of the C-BREQ-2 measurement model were invariant across the Chinese university students in the Mainland and Hong Kong of China. Conclusion The current study provided further psychometric evidence for the C-BREQ-2, which makes the further application and research of self-determination theory (SDT) based motivation in relation to exercise and physical activity in the Mainland of China context possible. },

Presently available tests for detection of BoNTs, although sensitive, require hours to days. We report a BoNT-B sensor whose properties allow detection of BoNT-B within minutes. The technique relies on the detection of an agarose bead detachment from the tip of a micromachined cantilever resulting from BoNT-B action on its substratum, the synaptic protein synaptobrevin 2, attached to the beads. The mechanical resonance frequency of the cantilever is monitored for the detection. To suspend the bead off the cantilever we use synaptobrevin's molecular interaction with another synaptic protein, syntaxin 1A, that was deposited onto the cantilever tip. Additionally, this bead detachment technique is general and can be used in any displacement reaction, such as in receptor-ligand pairs, where the introduction of one chemical leads to the displacement of another. The technique is of broad interest and will find uses outside toxicology},

Vad {\"{a}}r Clostridium botulinum?
Clostridium botulinum {\"{a}}r en bakterie som v{\"{a}}xer i syrefria milj{\"{o}}er och som bildar motst{\r{a}}ndskraftiga sporer som {\"{o}}verlever tillagning.

Var finns Clostridium botulinum?
C. botulinum f{\"{o}}rekommer {\"{o}}verallt i naturen i jord, slam och liknande. De bildar mycket motst{\r{a}}ndskraftiga sporer som {\"{o}}verlever tillagning.

Sporerna kan gro till bakterier som f{\"{o}}r{\"{o}}kar sig i livsmedlet d{\"{a}}r tillg{\r{a}}ngen p{\r{a}} syre {\"{a}}r liten. De v{\"{a}}xande bakterierna bildar ett nervgift, botulinumtoxin, som {\"{a}}r bland de starkaste gifter man k{\"{a}}nner till. Detta kan ske i bland annat felkonserverade livsmedel, hemgjorda oljeinl{\"{a}}ggningar, hemgjorda inl{\"{a}}ggningar av sill och str{\"{o}}mming och gravad eller r{\"{o}}kt vakuumpackad fisk som f{\"{o}}rvaras f{\"{o}}r varmt.

Hos sp{\"{a}}dbarn under ett {\r{a}}rs {\r{a}}lder kan sporer gro i tarmen och n{\"{a}}r bakterierna v{\"{a}}xer bildas botulinumtoxin som kan orsaka f{\"{o}}rgiftning, s{\r{a}} kallad sp{\"{a}}dbarnsbotulism. Denna botulism kan bara drabba sp{\"{a}}dbarn innan deras egen tarmflora av bakterier hunnit utvecklas tillr{\"{a}}ckligt mycket f{\"{o}}r att f{\"{o}}rhindra att C. botulinum v{\"{a}}xer.

Sjukdomstecken
Botulinumtoxin {\"{a}}r ett kraftigt nervgift som f{\"{o}}rlamar muskler.

Fr{\r{a}}n ett par timmar upp till flera dagar efter att man har f{\r{a}}tt i sig botulinumgiftet drabbas man av illam{\r{a}}ende och kr{\"{a}}kningar, synrubbningar, tal- och sv{\"{a}}ljsv{\r{a}}righeter, muskelsvaghet och andningssv{\r{a}}righeter. Denna f{\"{o}}rgiftning kan ha d{\"{o}}dlig utg{\r{a}}ng om en inte f{\r{a}}r v{\r{a}}rd, eftersom det i f{\"{o}}rl{\"{a}}ngningen inneb{\"{a}}r f{\"{o}}rlamning av andningsmuskulaturen. Botulismf{\"{o}}rgiftning smittar inte fr{\r{a}}n person till person.

I Sverige {\"{a}}r det mycket ovanligt med fall av b{\r{a}}de vanlig botulism och sp{\"{a}}dbarnsbotulism.

Hur undviker man att bli sjuk?
F{\"{o}}lj recepten noga om du konserverar eller g{\"{o}}r inl{\"{a}}ggningar. De m{\r{a}}ste inneh{\r{a}}lla tillr{\"{a}}ckligt med {\"{a}}ttika och salt, och f{\"{o}}rvaras kylsk{\r{a}}pskallt f{\"{o}}r att bakterierna inte ska kunna v{\"{a}}xa. Experimentera d{\"{a}}rf{\"{o}}r inte med egna saltm{\"{a}}ngder eller {\"{a}}ttiksyrahalter. Uts{\"{a}}tt inte produkten f{\"{o}}r h{\"{o}}ga temperaturer utan f{\"{o}}rvara alltid i kylsk{\r{a}}pstemperaturer.

R{\"{o}}kt och gravad fisk med l{\r{a}}ng h{\r{a}}llbarhet f{\"{o}}rvaras i h{\"{o}}gst +4°C. Att fisken {\"{a}}r r{\"{o}}kt inneb{\"{a}}r inte att den t{\r{a}}l att f{\"{o}}rvaras vid rumstemperatur.

Honung kan inneh{\r{a}}lla sporer fr{\r{a}}n C. botulinum. Ge d{\"{a}}rf{\"{o}}r inte honung till barn under ett {\r{a}}r. D{\"{a}}remot {\"{a}}r det inga problem att {\"{a}}ta honung om man {\"{a}}r gravid.

 

F{\"{o}}rdjupning
F{\"{o}}rekomst
Clostridium botulinum {\"{a}}r en anaerob (v{\"{a}}xer i syrefri milj{\"{o}}), sporbildande bakterie som f{\"{o}}rekommer allm{\"{a}}nt i naturen i jord, f{\"{o}}rmultnande v{\"{a}}xtmaterial och i bottenslammet i sj{\"{o}}ar och hav. Bakterien indelas p{\r{a}} grund av sin f{\"{o}}rm{\r{a}}ga att bilda funktionellt likartade toxiner i sju olika typer, A–G.

F{\"{o}}rgiftningstillst{\r{a}}nd hos m{\"{a}}nniska har rapporterats av typ A, B, E och F. Toxinet {\"{a}}r t{\"{a}}mligen v{\"{a}}rmelabilt och inaktiveras efter cirka tio minuter vid 80°C.

Utbrott av botulism {\"{a}}r mycket ovanligt i Sverige. I de fall det f{\"{o}}rekommit har smittk{\"{a}}llan ofta varit fiskprodukter. I andra l{\"{a}}nder {\"{a}}r det fr{\"{a}}mst gr{\"{o}}nsaks- och k{\"{o}}ttkonserver som pekats ut som smittk{\"{a}}lla.

S{\r{a}} l{\"{a}}nge bakterien befinner sig i sporform {\"{a}}r den ofarlig. Men beroende p{\r{a}} livsmedlets egenskaper och hur det f{\"{o}}rvaras kan den i vissa fall b{\"{o}}rja aktiveras (f{\"{o}}rvandlas till en aktivt v{\"{a}}xande bakterie). F{\"{o}}r tillv{\"{a}}xt kr{\"{a}}vs anaerob milj{\"{o}} samt att pH {\"{o}}verstiger 4,5. Den anaeroba milj{\"{o}}n uppn{\r{a}}s i till exempel vakuumf{\"{o}}rpackade fiskprodukter. Bakterien tillv{\"{a}}xer ej vid temperaturer under +4°C.

Bakterien h{\"{a}}mmas av koksalt. Salttoleransen varierar f{\"{o}}r de olika typerna av C. botulinum. C. botulinum typ E som p{\r{a}}tr{\"{a}}ffas i fisk och andra marina produkter {\"{a}}r k{\"{a}}nsligast, och dess toxinbildande f{\"{o}}rm{\r{a}}ga upph{\"{o}}r redan vid salthalter {\"{o}}ver 4 procent. Vid bed{\"{o}}mning av risken f{\"{o}}r tillv{\"{a}}xt och toxinbildning m{\r{a}}ste man ta h{\"{a}}nsyn till flera samverkande faktorer. I exempelvis sillinl{\"{a}}ggningar sker en samverkan mellan salt, {\"{a}}ttika (l{\r{a}}gt pH) och l{\r{a}}g temperatur, s{\r{a}} att deras gemensamma h{\"{a}}mmande effekt blir starkare {\"{a}}n de enskilda komponenternas.

Utbrott och fall
Matf{\"{o}}rgiftningen (botulism) f{\"{o}}rorsakas - med undantag f{\"{o}}r sp{\"{a}}dbarnsbotulism - av att ett neurotoxin producerats i livsmedlet av bakterien vid tillv{\"{a}}xt. Botulinumtoxinet tillh{\"{o}}r de mest potenta, naturliga gifterna och ett enda gram av toxinet anses kunna d{\"{o}}da en miljon m{\"{a}}nniskor.

Ibland f{\"{o}}reg{\r{a}}s de neurologiska symtomen av illam{\r{a}}ende, kr{\"{a}}kningar och diarré. Efter en inkubationstid p{\r{a}} 12–36 timmar intr{\"{a}}der de f{\"{o}}rsta neurologiska symtomen best{\r{a}}ende av dimsyn och muntorrhet, f{\"{o}}ljt av dubbelseende, tal- och sv{\"{a}}ljsv{\r{a}}righeter samt muskelsvaghet. Slutligen intr{\"{a}}der andningsf{\"{o}}rlamning, vilket kan leda till d{\"{o}}den om behandling inte s{\"{a}}tts in.

Vid typ E-botulism kan behandling ges med antitoxin. {\"{O}}vriga typer behandlas idag med underst{\"{o}}djande terapi, bland annat med respiratorbehandling. Sjukdomsf{\"{o}}rloppet {\"{a}}r ofta l{\r{a}}ngdraget och respiratorbehandling i ett par m{\r{a}}nader f{\"{o}}rekommer. Synrubbningar kan kvarst{\r{a}} i upp till ett {\r{a}}r.

Botulism utg{\"{o}}r, p{\r{a}} grund av det dramatiska sjukdomsf{\"{o}}rloppet och dess alvarliga konsekvenser, en av de mest fruktade matf{\"{o}}rgiftningarna. Ytterst f{\r{a}} fall har intr{\"{a}}ffat i Sverige. Sedan 1969 har knappt 20 fall av botulism rapporterats i Sverige, varav fem sp{\"{a}}dbarnsbotulism. F{\"{o}}rutom f{\"{o}}r sp{\"{a}}dbarnen var fiskprodukter som heminlagd sill samt gravad och r{\"{o}}kt lax smittk{\"{a}}lla i n{\"{a}}stan alla fall.

De flesta fall av botulism beror p{\r{a}} felaktig hantering och/eller tillagning. Bland fallen kan n{\"{a}}mnas varmr{\"{o}}kt vakuumf{\"{o}}rpackad lax, som f{\"{o}}rvarats vid f{\"{o}}r h{\"{o}}g temperatur i butik, och en hemlagad sillinl{\"{a}}ggning, d{\"{a}}r f{\"{o}}r lite {\"{a}}ttika i f{\"{o}}rh{\r{a}}llande till fiskvikt anv{\"{a}}nts.

Sp{\"{a}}dbarnsbotulism
Denna form av botulism skiljer sig fr{\r{a}}n den normala genom att sporerna gror och en tillv{\"{a}}xt av bakterien sker i tarmen, d{\"{a}}r toxinet bildas. Denna botulism kan endast drabba sp{\"{a}}dbarn under ett {\r{a}}rs {\r{a}}lder, d{\r{a}} barnets egen tarmflora ej hunnit utvecklas f{\"{o}}r att kunna konkurrera med clostridiebakterierna.

Sp{\"{a}}dbarn kan smittas genom inandning av sporer fr{\r{a}}n jord i samband med gr{\"{a}}varbeten, eller via honung som kan inneh{\r{a}}lla sporer. I ett av de fem fall av sp{\"{a}}dbarnsbotulism som intr{\"{a}}ffat i Sverige under de senaste trettio {\r{a}}ren kan smittk{\"{a}}llan ha varit honung. I {\"{o}}vriga var smittk{\"{a}}llan antingen jord eller ok{\"{a}}nd efter utlandsvistelse.},

  abstract      = {Higher levels of moderate to vigorous physical activity improve all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events. However, the effect of running, a moderate to vigorous activity, in those with knee osteoarthritis (OA), a common arthritis that occurs with aging, a high-risk group for mortality and cardiovascular events, is unclear. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the association of self-selected running on OA symptom and structure progression in people with knee OA. This nested cohort study within the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) (2004--2014) included those at least 50Â years old with OA in at least one knee. Runners were defined using a self-administered questionnaire at the 96-month visit. At baseline and 48-months, symptoms were assessed and radiographs were scored for Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade (2--4) and medial Joint Space Narrowing (JSN) score (0--3). We evaluated the association of self-selected running with outcomes: KL worsening, medial JSN worsening, new knee pain, and improved knee pain over 48Â months, adjusting for baseline age, sex, body mass index (BMI), KL score, contralateral KL score, contralateral knee pain, and injury. If data were not available at the 48-month visit, then they were imputed from the 36-month visit. One thousand two hundred three participants had a mean age of 63.2 (7.9) years, BMI of 29.5 (4.6) kg/m2, 45.3{\%} male, and 11.5{\%} runners. Data from 8{\%} of participants required imputation. Adjusted odds ratios for KL grade worsening and new frequent knee pain were 0.9 (0.6--1.3) and 0.9 (0.6--1.6) respectively. Adjusted odds ratio for frequent knee pain resolution was 1.7 (1.0--2.8). Among individuals 50Â years old and older with knee OA, self-selected running is associated with improved knee pain and not with worsening knee pain or radiographically defined structural progression. Therefore, self-selected running, which is likely influenced by knee symptoms and may result in lower intensity and shorter duration sessions of exercise, need not be discouraged in people with knee OA.},

A true meiotic process occurs only in eukaryotes, while in bacteria, gene transcription is fragmentary, so asexual reproduction in this case really means clonal reproduction. Sex could stem from a signal that leads to increased reproductive output of all interacting individuals and could be understood as a secondary consequence of primitive metabolic reactions. Meiotic sex evolved in proto-eukaryotes to solve a problem that bacteria did not have, namely a large amount of DNA material, occurring in an archaic step of proto-cell formation and genetic exchanges. Rather than providing selective advantages through reproduction, sex could be thought of as a series of separate events which combines step-by-step some very weak benefits of recombination, meiosis, gametogenesis and syngamy.},

In rodents intermittent or periodic fasting protects against diabetes, cancers, heart disease, and neurodegeneration, while in humans it helps reduce obesity, hypertension, asthma, and rheumatoid arthritis.

  abstract      = {The effect of the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) (formerly Cretaceous{\textendash}Tertiary, K{\textendash}T) mass extinction on avian evolution is debated, primarily because of the poor fossil record of Late Cretaceous birds. In particular, it remains unclear whether archaic birds became extinct gradually over the course of the Cretaceous or whether they remained diverse up to the end of the Cretaceous and perished in the K{\textendash}Pg mass extinction. Here, we describe a diverse avifauna from the latest Maastrichtian of western North America, which provides definitive evidence for the persistence of a range of archaic birds to within 300,000 y of the K{\textendash}Pg boundary. A total of 17 species are identified, including 7 species of archaic bird, representing Enantiornithes, Ichthyornithes, Hesperornithes, and an Apsaravis-like bird. None of these groups are known to survive into the Paleogene, and their persistence into the latest Maastrichtian therefore provides strong evidence for a mass extinction of archaic birds coinciding with the Chicxulub asteroid impact. Most of the birds described here represent advanced ornithurines, showing that a major radiation of Ornithurae preceded the end of the Cretaceous, but none can be definitively referred to the Neornithes. This avifauna is the most diverse known from the Late Cretaceous, and although size disparity is lower than in modern birds, the assemblage includes both smaller forms and some of the largest volant birds known from the Mesozoic, emphasizing the degree to which avian diversification had proceeded by the end of the age of dinosaurs.},

  abstract      = {The literature on Conium maculatum biochemistry and toxicology, dispersed in a large number of scientific publications, has been put together in this review. C. maculatum is a weed known almost worldwide by its toxicity to many domestic animals and to human beings. It is an Umbelliferae, characterized by long, hollow stems, reaching up to 2 m height at maturity, producing a large amount of lush foliage during its vegetative growth. Its flowers are white, grouped in umbels formed by numerous umbellules. It produces a large number of seeds that allow the plant to form thick stands in modified soils, sometimes encroaching on cultivated fields, to the extent of impeding the growth of any other vegetation inside the C. maculatum area of growth. Eight piperidinic alkaloids have been identified in this species. Two of them, -coniceine and coniine are generally the most abundant and they account for most of the plant acute and chronic toxicity. These alkaloids are synthesized by the plant from eight acetate units from the metabolic pool, forming a polyketoacid which cyclises through an aminotransferase and forms -coniceine as the parent alkaloid via reduction by a NADPH-dependent reductase. The acute toxicity is observed when animals ingest C. maculatum vegetative and flowering plants and seeds. In a short time the alkaloids produce a neuromuscular blockage conducive to death when the respiratory muscles are affected. The chronic toxicity affects only pregnant animals. When they are poisoned by C. maculatum during the fetuses organ formation period, the offspring is born with malformations, mainly palatoschisis and multiple congenital contractures (MCC; frequently described as arthrogryposis). Acute toxicity, if not lethal, may resolve in the spontaneous recovery of the affected animals provided further exposure to C. maculatum is avoided. It has been observed that poisoned animals tend to return to feed on this plant. Chronic toxicity is irreversible and although MCC can be surgically corrected in some cases, most of the malformed animals are lost. Since no specific antidote is available, prevention is the only way to deal with the production loses caused by this weed. Control with herbicides and grazing with less susceptible animals (such as sheep) have been suggested. C. maculatum alkaloids can be transferred to milk and to fowl muscle tissue through which the former can reach the human food chain. The losses produced by C. maculatum chronic toxicity may be largely underestimated, at least in some regions, because of the difficulty in associate malformations in offspring with the much earlier maternal poisoning.},

However, the nature of the mitochondrial host is controversial, although the recent discovery of an archaeal lineage phylogenetically close to eukaryotes reinforces models proposing archaea-derived hosts. We argue that, in addition to improved phylogenomic analyses with more comprehensive taxon sampling to pinpoint the closest prokaryotic relatives of eukaryotes, determining plausible mechanisms and selective forces at the origin of key eukaryotic features, such as the nucleus or the bacterial-like eukaryotic membrane system, is essential to constrain existing models.},

  abstract      = {Caffeine elevates cortisol secretion, and caffeine is often consumed in conjunction with exercise or mental stress. The interactions of caffeine and stress on cortisol secretion have not been explored adequately in women. We measured cortisol levels at eight times on days when healthy men and women consumed caffeine (250Â mg Ã 3) and underwent either mental stress or dynamic exercise protocols, followed by a midday meal, in a double blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Men and women had similar cortisol levels at the predrug baselines, but they responded differently to mental stress and exercise. The cortisol response to mental stress was smaller in women than in men (p = .003). Caffeine acted in concert with mental stress to further increase cortisol levels (p = .011), the effect was similar in men and women. Exercise alone did not increase cortisol, but caffeine taken before exercise elevated cortisol in both men and women (ps &lt; .05). After a postexercise meal, the women had a larger cortisol response than the men, and this effect was greater after caffeine (p &lt; .01). Cortisol release in response to stress and caffeine therefore appears to be a function of the type of stressor and the sex of the subject. However, repeated caffeine doses increased cortisol levels across the test day without regard to the sex of the subject or type of stressor employed (p &lt; .00001). Caffeine may elevate cortisol by stimulating the central nervous system in men but may interact with peripheral metabolic mechanisms in women. },

Here we argue that at least some of the same factors which influence investment decisions postpartum also affect the decision to terminate a current pregnancy through voluntary abortion. We show that both female age and marital status influence the probability of abortion, with the key variable being the likelihood of future marriage. Thus, abortion procedures extend a woman's ability to manage her reproduction into the prenatal period.},

modifying cold exposure are: age, gender, employment, education, health, and amount of physi-
cal exercise. Several symptoms and complaints are associated with wintertime cold exposure
and start to appear more commonly when temperatures decrease below 108C. Urban circum-
polar people do not evidently demonstrate cold acclimatization responses in terms of changes in
thermoregulation, probably due to behavioral factors (adequate protective clothing, short cold
exposures, and high housing temperatures). With regard to performance, we observed that mod-
erate cold exposure, which may occur in everyday life, affects cognition negatively through the
mechanisms of distraction and both positively and negatively through the mechanism of arousal
(increased vigilance). It seems that especially simple cognitive tasks are adversely affected by
cold, while in more complex tasks performance may even improve in mild or moderate cold.
Repeated, short cold exposures in the laboratory, causing cold habituation responses, do not
markedly improve neuromuscular or cognitive performance. The article discusses the functional
significance of cold exposure, adaptation, and the specific environmental conditions and physio-
logical mechanisms that affect behavior and performance in high latitude environments. Am. J.

populations, followed by a reduction in variance in fear responses with a subsequent increase in diversity of fear responses as
urban populations become adapted to the urban environment. Using information on variance in flight initiation distances
(FIDs) when approached by a human, I show that rural populations of birds characterized by short mean flight distances and
large variances in flight distances differentially colonized urban areas. As a consequence of this urban invasion, urban populations
lost variation in FID. The variance in FID was initially larger in rural than in urban populations but eventually became larger
in urban populations with time since urbanization. This secondary increase in variance in FID of urban populations was
associated with an increase in population density of urban populations, suggesting that as birds became adapted to urban
areas, they secondarily gained variance in behavioral flexibility. Key words: flight initiation distance, invasion, personality,

This review considers the acute and chronic effects of different levels of carbohydrate (CHO) intakes. The type of CHO consumed, especially glucose vs fructose, affects the glycaemic, insulinaemic and thermogenic responses. In addition, other aspects of food (type of starch, method of processing or cooking, presence of other nutrients) affects the glycaemic response (glycaemic index). In general, the greatest benefit to health is derived from consuming foods with a low glycaemic index and a high non-starch polysaccharide (fibre) content. Healthy, moderately active adults require at least 200g CHO per day to sustain normal brain metabolism and muscle function. Moreover, the CHO content should represent at least 50% of energy intake. Higher intakes of CHO can have deleterious effects on blood lipids (especially plasma triacylglycerol) in middle-aged and elderly subjects, and are really only appropriate for subjects with a high level of physical activity who need to maintain muscle glycogen content. Meals with a high carbohydrate content can lead to problems of postprandial hypotension in the elderly, and impaired exercise capacity in patients with angina.},

For example, previous studies of prehistoric Central European agriculturalists (~5300 calibrated years BC to 850 AD) demonstrated a significant reduction in tibial rigidity among men, whereas women were characterized by low tibial rigidity, little temporal change, and high variability. Because of the potential for sex-specific skeletal responses to mechanical loading and a lack of modern comparative data, women{\textquoteright}s activity in prehistory remains difficult to interpret. This study compares humeral and tibial cross-sectional rigidity, shape, and interlimb loading among prehistoric Central European women agriculturalists and living European women of known behavior (athletes and controls). Prehistoric female tibial rigidity at all time periods was highly variable, but differed little from living sedentary women on average, and was significantly lower than that of living runners and football players. However, humeral rigidity exceeded that of living athletes for the first ~5500 years of farming, with loading intensity biased heavily toward the upper limb. Interlimb strength proportions among Neolithic, Bronze Age, and Iron Age women were most similar to those of living semi-elite rowers. These results suggest that, in contrast to men, rigorous manual labor was a more important component of prehistoric women{\textquoteright}s behavior than was terrestrial mobility through thousands of years of European agriculture, at levels far exceeding those of modern women.},

  abstract      = {Dieting is the most common approach to losing weight for the majority of obese and overweight individuals. Restricting intake leads to weight loss in the short term, but, by itself, dieting has a relatively poor success rate for long-term weight reduction. Most obese people eventually regain the weight they have worked so hard to lose. Weight regain has emerged as one of the most significant obstacles for obesity therapeutics, undoubtedly perpetuating the epidemic of excess weight that now affects more than 60\% of U.S. adults. In this review, we summarize the evidence of biology{\textquoteright}s role in the problem of weight regain. Biology{\textquoteright}s impact is first placed in context with other pressures known to affect body weight. Then, the biological adaptations to an energy-restricted, low-fat diet that are known to occur in the overweight and obese are reviewed, and an integrative picture of energy homeostasis after long-term weight reduction and during weight regain is presented. Finally, a novel model is proposed to explain the persistence of the {\textquotedblleft}energy depletion{\textquotedblright} signal during the dynamic metabolic state of weight regain, when traditional adiposity signals no longer reflect stored energy in the periphery. The preponderance of evidence would suggest that the biological response to weight loss involves comprehensive, persistent, and redundant adaptations in energy homeostasis and that these adaptations underlie the high recidivism rate in obesity therapeutics. To be successful in the long term, our strategies for preventing weight regain may need to be just as comprehensive, persistent, and redundant, as the biological adaptations they are attempting to counter.},

  abstract      = {Weight regain after weight loss is a substantial challenge in obesity therapeutics. Dieting leads to significant adaptations in the homeostatic system that controls body weight, which promotes overeating and the relapse to obesity. In this review, we focus specifically on the adaptations in white adipose tissues that contribute to the biological drive to regain weight after weight loss. Weight loss leads to a reduction in size of adipocytes and this decline in size alters their metabolic and inflammatory characteristics in a manner that facilitates the clearance and storage of ingested energy. We present the hypothesis whereby the long-term signals reflecting stored energy and short-term signals reflecting nutrient availability are derived from the cellularity characteristics of adipose tissues. These signals are received and integrated in the hypothalamus and hindbrain and an energy gap between appetite and metabolic requirements emerges and promotes a positive energy imbalance and weight regain. In this paradigm, the cellularity and metabolic characteristics of adipose tissues after energy-restricted weight loss could explain the persistence of a biological drive to regain weight during both weight maintenance and the dynamic period of weight regain.},

We asked whether these enhancements follow simply from prior effects on item-memory, or also strengthen associations between items. Participants studied word pairs varying in imageability or frequency: pairs were âpureâ (highâhigh, lowâlow) or âmixedâ (highâlow, lowâhigh) where âhighâ and âlowâ refer to imageability or frequency values and are probed with forward (Aâ?) and backward (?âB) cues. Probabilistic model fits to the data suggested that imageability primarily improved retrieval of associations, but frequency primarily improved recall of target items. All pair types exhibited a high correlation between forward and backward probe accuracy, a measure of holistic learning (Kahana, 2002), which extends the boundary conditions of holistic association-memory and challenges Paivioâs (1971) suggestion that holistic learning depends critically on imagery. In sum, item properties can boost association-memory beyond simply boosting target retrievability.},

The different types of placebo acupuncture were ranked from 1 to 5 according to assessment of the possibility of a physiological effect, and this ranking was meta-regressed with the effect of acupuncture.Data synthesis Thirteen trials (3025 patients) involving a variety of pain conditions were eligible. The allocation of patients was adequately concealed in eight trials. The clinicians managing the acupuncture and placebo acupuncture treatments were not blinded in any of the trials. One clearly outlying trial (70 patients) was excluded. A small difference was found between acupuncture and placebo acupuncture: standardised mean difference -0.17 (95\% confidence interval -0.26 to -0.08), corresponding to 4 mm (2 mm to 6 mm) on a 100 mm visual analogue scale. No statistically significant heterogeneity was present (P=0.10, I2=36\%). A moderate difference was found between placebo acupuncture and no acupuncture: standardised mean difference -0.42 (-0.60 to -0.23). However, considerable heterogeneity (P\&lt;0.001, I2=66\%) was also found, as large trials reported both small and large effects of placebo. No association was detected between the type of placebo acupuncture and the effect of acupuncture (P=0.60).Conclusions A small analgesic effect of acupuncture was found, which seems to lack clinical relevance and cannot be clearly distinguished from bias. Whether needling at acupuncture points, or at any site, reduces pain independently of the psychological impact of the treatment ritual is unclear.},

Why then is multiple copulation by females so common1–6? Many theoreticians have suggested that multiple copulations might enhance the viability of a female's offspring, either because of inadequate quantities of sperm from the first mating1,7, additional nutrients derived from the seminal fluid7,8 or some genetic advantage9–14. Our field studies on Swedish adders provide the first empirical evidence that multiple copulations, with different partners each time, increase offspring viability. This advantage apparently results from more intense sperm competition in the female's reproductive tract, resulting in a higher proportion of her ova being fertilized by genetically superior males.},

The solubilities of manganese sulphate under and over the maximum solubility temperature were first predicted individually by the electrolyte NRTL model. The binary interaction parameters and solubility parameters were universal parameters that were applied to any salts consisting of manganese, magnesium and sulfate ions, and they were newly obtained from the binary solubility data. The predicted solubility curves could represent the experimental data quantitatively, and adequately described the effect of co-salt of magnesium. The experimental solubility data were also satisfactorily correlated with the electrolyte NRTL model.},

  abstract      = { Objectives To investigate young male students' behaviour, knowledge, attitudes, and needs related to sexual and reproductive health (SRH). Differences between students on vocational and academic study programmes were also investigated.Method A questionnaire consisting of 87 multiple choice questions was distributed to 253 male students attending three upper secondary schools in a single Swedish county.Results A response rate of 76\% (n = 192) was achieved. Vocational students displayed more risk behaviour than those in academic study programmes regarding use of tobacco and sexual behaviour. Eighteen percent of those who were sexually experienced had suggested or provided the emergency contraception pill (ECP) to a girl. Insufficient knowledge of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) was identified, especially among the vocational students. No one reported the upper secondary school as their main source of knowledge and both groups requested more information about both genders' reproductive systems, and STIs. Some discriminatory attitudes regarding gender equality in SRH matters were identified. Both groups stated that male-friendly Youth Health Clinics (YHCs), easier access to condoms and Internet-service for Chlamydia test are important.Conclusions Improvements in the quality and quantity of sex education in upper secondary schools are needed; they should be tailored to the spectrum of students' situations and needs. A structure of the YHC adapted to male youths' needs and alternative, easily accessible STI tests are important factors for reaching young men and having them participate in a responsible way in protecting their own and their partners' SRH. },

  abstract      = { ABSTRACTBackground Almost 40\% of all induced abortions in Sweden are repeat abortions; little is known about the risk factors.Objective To investigate differences between women who had a first-time abortion and those with repeat abortion, and to identify factors associated with repeat abortion.Methods A questionnaire was answered by 798 abortion-seeking women in Sweden during 2009. A regression model was used to assess risk factors for repeat abortions.Results In the age range 20â49 years, 41\% of women had experienced at least one previous abortion. Risk factors for repeat abortion were parity (OR 2.57), lack of emotional support (OR 2.09), unemployment or sick leave (OR 1.65), tobacco use (OR 1.56), and low educational level (OR 1.5). Some women (n = 55) considered economic support and work opportunities could have enabled them to continue the pregnancy. Increased Sex and Relationship Education (SRE), easy access to high-quality contraception and counselling, were suggested (n = 86) as interventions for preventing unintended pregnancies.Conclusions Even in a country with long established SRE and a public health policy to enhance sexual and reproductive health over a third of women requesting abortion have experienced one previously and the rate is maintained. Some specific factors are identified but, overall, a picture of vulnerability among women seeking repeat abortion stands out that needs to be considered in the prevention of unintended pregnancies. },

Malinsky et al. investigated how two ecomorphs of cichlid fish in a small lake in Tanzania are diversifying relative to each other. Although there is gene flow between the two forms, major regions of genetic divergence, known as genomic islands, separate the populations. Within these islands, the authors found genes likely to be associated with mate choice, supporting the idea that genetic changes related to breeding preferences are the first to diverge during speciation.Science, this issue p. 1493The genomic causes and effects of divergent ecological selection during speciation are still poorly understood. Here we report the discovery and detailed characterization of early-stage adaptive divergence of two cichlid fish ecomorphs in a small (700 meters in diameter) isolated crater lake in Tanzania. The ecomorphs differ in depth preference, male breeding color, body shape, diet, and trophic morphology. With whole-genome sequences of 146 fish, we identified 98 clearly demarcated genomic {\textquotedblleft}islands{\textquotedblright} of high differentiation and demonstrated the association of genotypes across these islands with divergent mate preferences.

Our study suggests mechanisms and genomic regions that may play a role in the closely related mega-radiation of Lake Malawi.},

  abstract      = {Thermooxidation at 100{\textdegree}C and photooxidation at wavelengths above 300 nm of dried oil films were evaluated. The chemical modifications of the networks were determined by infrared analysis coupled with gaseous treatments (NO, SF4, and NH3). The dried films are rather stable in thermooxidation, whereas in photooxidation, important degradation of the network occurs with many chain scissions. This photoinstability results from the presence of crosslinks that are sensitive to radical attack because of the lability of the hydrogen atom on the tertiary carbons. The photooxidation reactions are fully described in this paper. Yellowing of the cured samples, observed with ultraviolet-visible and fluorescence spectrometries, rapidly is decreased by irradiation because the oil contaminants that are mainly responsible for the yellowness are photooxidized. On the contrary, yellowing slowly but continuously increases during thermooxidation at 100{\textdegree}C.},

Ketone bodies flow from the liver to extra-hepatic tissues (e.g., brain) for use as a fuel; this spares glucose metabolism via a mechanism similar to the sparing of glucose by oxidation of fatty acids as an alternative fuel. In comparison with glucose, the ketone bodies are actually a very good respiratory fuel. Indeed, there is no clear requirement for dietary carbohydrates for human adults. Interestingly, the effects of ketone body metabolism suggest that mild ketosis may offer therapeutic potential in a variety of different common and rare disease states. Also, the recent landmark study showed that a very-low-carbohydrate diet resulted in a significant reduction in fat mass and a concomitant increase in lean body mass in normal-weight men. Contrary to popular belief, insulin is not needed for glucose uptake and utilization in man. Finally, both muscle fat and carbohydrate burn in an amino acid flame.},

  abstract      = {Abstract:Background The global burden of sepsis is estimated as 15 to 19 million cases annually with a mortality rate approaching 60% in low income countries. Methods In this retrospective before-after clinical study, we compared the outcome and clinical course of consecutive septic patients treated with intravenous vitamin C, hydrocortisone and thiamine during a 7-month period (treatment group) compared to a control group treated in our \{ICU\} during the preceding 7 months. The primary outcome was hospital survival. A propensity score was generated to adjust the primary outcome. Findings There were 47 patients in both treatment and control groups with no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups. The hospital mortality was 8.5% (4 of 47) in the treatment group compared to 40.4% (19 of 47) in the control group (p &lt; 0.001). The propensity adjusted odds of mortality in the patients treated with the vitamin C protocol was 0.13 (95% \{CI\} 0.04-0.48, p=002). The \{SOFA\} score decreased in all patients in the treatment group with none developing progressive organ failure. Vasopressors were weaned off all patients in the treatment group, a mean of 18.3 Â± 9.8 hours after starting treatment with vitamin C protocol. The mean duration of vasopressor use was 54.9 Â± 28.4 hours in the control group (p&lt;0.001). Conclusion Our results suggest that the early use of intravenous vitamin C, together with corticosteroids and thiamine may prove to be effective in preventing progressive organ dysfunction including acute kidney injury and reducing the mortality of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Additional studies are required to confirm these preliminary findings. },

  abstract      = {Abstract Human pair bonding is often attributed to the importance of male provisioning. However, this has been called into question in recent years. Among tropical hunterâgatherers like the Hadza of Tanzania, the foods that men acquire contribute less to the diet than women's foods, are acquired with less regularity, and are shared more widely outside the household. This forces us to ask what benefits forager women gain from being married. Here, I present data suggesting that Hadza women benefit from a husband's provisioning when they have young nurslings. During this critical period, women have lower foraging returns and return rates, while their husbands have higher returns. These higher returns are not due to more meat, but to less widely shared foods, like honey. Even if women are subsidizing husbands much of the time, provisioning by husbands during this critical period of lactation could be enough to favor pair bonding.},

  abstract      = {Height is a highly heritable, classic polygenic trait with approximately 700 common associated variants identified through genome-wide association studies so far. Here, we report 83 height-associated coding variants with lower minor-allele frequencies (in the range of 0.1â4.8%) and effects of up to 2âcentimetres per allele (such as those in IHH, STC2, AR and CRISPLD2), greater than ten times the average effect of common variants. In functional follow-up studies, rare height-increasing alleles of STC2 (giving an increase of 1â2âcentimetres per allele) compromised proteolytic inhibition of PAPP-A and increased cleavage of IGFBP-4 in vitro, resulting in higher bioavailability of insulin-like growth factors. These 83 height-associated variants overlap genes that are mutated in monogenic growth disorders and highlight new biological candidates (such as ADAMTS3, IL11RA and NOX4) and pathways (such as proteoglycan and glycosaminoglycan synthesis) involved in growth. Our results demonstrate that sufficiently large sample sizes can uncover rare and low-frequency variants of moderate-to-large effect associated with polygenic human phenotypes, and that these variants implicate relevant genes and pathways.},

  abstract      = {Background In aggressive mimicry, a predator or parasite imitates a signal of another species in order to exploit the recipient of the signal. Some of the most remarkable examples of aggressive mimicry involve exploitation of a complex signal-response system by an unrelated predator species. Methodology/Principal Findings We have found that predatory Chlorobalius leucoviridis katydids (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae) can attract male cicadas (Hemiptera: Cicadidae) by imitating the species-specific wing-flick replies of sexually receptive female cicadas. This aggressive mimicry is accomplished both acoustically, with tegminal clicks, and visually, with synchronized body jerks. Remarkably, the katydids respond effectively to a variety of complex, species-specific Cicadettini songs, including songs of many cicada species that the predator has never encountered. Conclusions/Significance We propose that the versatility of aggressive mimicry in C. leucoviridis is accomplished by exploiting general design elements common to the songs of many acoustically signaling insects that use duets in pair-formation. Consideration of the mechanism of versatile mimicry in C. leucoviridis may illuminate processes driving the evolution of insect acoustic signals, which play a central role in reproductive isolation of populations and the formation of species.},

  abstract      = {A number of domestication hypotheses suggest that dogs have acquired a more tolerant temperament than wolves, promoting cooperative interactions with humans and conspecifics. This selection process has been proposed to resemble the one responsible for our own greater cooperative inclinations in comparison with our closest living relatives. However, the socioecology of wolves and dogs, with the former relying more heavily on cooperative activities, predicts that at least with conspecifics, wolves should cooperate better than dogs. Here we tested similarly raised wolves and dogs in a cooperative string-pulling task with conspecifics and found that wolves outperformed dogs, despite comparable levels of interest in the task. Whereas wolves coordinated their actions so as to simultaneously pull the rope ends, leading to success, dogs pulled the ropes in alternate moments, thereby never succeeding. Indeed in dog dyads it was also less likely that both members simultaneously engaged in other manipulative behaviors on the apparatus. Different conflict-management strategies are likely responsible for these results, with dogs’ avoidance of potential competition over the apparatus constraining their capacity to coordinate actions. Wolves, in contrast, did not hesitate to manipulate the ropes simultaneously, and once cooperation was initiated, rapidly learned to coordinate in more complex conditions as well. Social dynamics (rank and affiliation) played a key role in success rates. Results call those domestication hypotheses that suggest dogs evolved greater cooperative inclinations into question, and rather support the idea that dogs’ and wolves’ different social ecologies played a role in affecting their capacity for conspecific cooperation and communication.},

Despite strong phylogenetic evidence that mitochondria had an alphaproteobacterial ancestry 2 , efforts to pinpoint their closest relatives among sampled alphaproteobacteria have generated conflicting results, complicating detailed inferences about the identity and nature of the mitochondrial ancestor. While most studies support the idea that mitochondria evolved from an ancestor related to Rickettsiales3â9, an order that includes several host-associated pathogenic and endosymbiotic lineages10,11, others have suggested that mitochondria evolved from a free-living group12â14. Here we re-evaluate the phylogenetic placement of mitochondria. We used genome-resolved binning of oceanic metagenome datasets and increased the genomic sampling of Alphaproteobacteria with twelve divergent clades, and one clade representing a sister group to all Alphaproteobacteria. Subsequent phylogenomic analyses that specifically address long branch attraction and compositional bias artefacts suggest that mitochondria did not evolve from Rickettsiales or any other currently recognized alphaproteobacterial lineage. Rather, our analyses indicate that mitochondria evolved from a proteobacterial lineage that branched off before the divergence of all sampled alphaproteobacteria. In light of this new result, previous hypotheses on the nature of the mitochondrial ancestor6,15,16 should be re-evaluated.},

Central to the model is a pair of local fitness functions, which prescribe the fitness of the altruist and selfish phenotypes as functions of the composition of local groups into which prereproductives are subdivided. When the local groups are sibships or other kin groups, the model is one for kin selection. Functions for cost and benefit of altruism are derived from the fitness functions. Conditions for evolution of altruism are then determined in terms of cost and benefit. It is shown that the Hamilton rule has quantitative validity only in the special case of linear fitness functions. Sufficient conditions are found for qualitative validity of the Hamilton rule. Qualitative violation of the rule is also possible.

  abstract      = {Cicadas are dependent on the essential bacterial symbionts Sulcia and Hodgkinia. The symbiont genomes are extremely streamlined for provisioning of essential amino acids and other nutrients. In some cicada lineages, Hodgkinia genomes are fragmented into numerous minicircles, which may represent a critical stage of genomic erosion close to collapse. What would happen subsequently? Our survey of the Japanese cicada diversity revealed that while Sulcia is conserved among all species, the majority of them have lost Hodgkinia and instead harbor yeast-like fungal associates. The fungal symbionts are phylogenetically intermingled with cicada-parasitizing Ophiocordyceps fungi, indicating recurrent symbiont replacements by entomopathogens in cicadas and providing insights into the mechanisms underlying the parasitism-symbiosis evolutionary continuum, compensation of symbiont genome erosion, and diversification of host-symbiont associations.Diverse insects are associated with ancient bacterial symbionts, whose genomes have often suffered drastic reduction and degeneration. In extreme cases, such symbiont genomes seem almost unable to sustain the basic cellular functioning, which comprises an open question in the evolution of symbiosis. Here, we report an insect group wherein an ancient symbiont lineage suffering massive genome erosion has experienced recurrent extinction and replacement by host-associated pathogenic microbes. Cicadas are associated with the ancient bacterial co-obligate symbionts Sulcia and Hodgkinia, whose streamlined genomes are specialized for synthesizing essential amino acids, thereby enabling the host to live on plant sap. However, our inspection of 24 Japanese cicada species revealed that while all species possessed Sulcia, only nine species retained Hodgkinia, and their genomes exhibited substantial structural instability. The remaining 15 species lacked Hodgkinia and instead harbored yeast-like fungal symbionts. Detailed phylogenetic analyses uncovered repeated Hodgkinia-fungus and fungus-fungus replacements in cicadas. The fungal symbionts were phylogenetically intermingled with cicada-parasitizing Ophiocordyceps fungi, identifying entomopathogenic origins of the fungal symbionts. Most fungal symbionts of cicadas were uncultivable, but the fungal symbiont of Meimuna opalifera was cultivable, possibly because it is at an early stage of fungal symbiont replacement. Genome sequencing of the fungal symbiont revealed its metabolic versatility, presumably capable of synthesizing almost all amino acids, vitamins, and other metabolites, which is more than sufficient to compensate for the Hodgkinia loss. These findings highlight a straightforward ecological and evolutionary connection between parasitism and symbiosis, which may provide an evolutionary trajectory to renovate deteriorated ancient symbiosis via pathogen domestication.},

The University of Wisconsin study reported a significant positive impact of CR on survival, but the National Institute on Aging study detected no significant survival effect. Here we present a direct comparison of longitudinal data from both studies including survival, bodyweight, food intake, fasting glucose levels and age-related morbidity. We describe differences in study design that could contribute to differences in outcomes, and we report species specificity in the impact of CR in terms of optimal onset and diet. Taken together these data confirm that health benefits of CR are conserved in monkeys and suggest that CR mechanisms are likely translatable to human health.},

  abstract      = {Chronic mild dehydration is a common condition in some population groups, including especially the elderly and those who participate in physical activity in warm environments. Hypohydration is recognised as a precipitating factor in a number of acute medical conditions in the elderly, and there may be an association, although not necessarily a causal one, between a low habitual fluid intake and some cancers, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. There is some evidence of impairments of cognitive function at moderate levels of hypohydration, but even short periods of fluid restriction, leading to a loss of body mass of 1–2%, lead to reductions in the subjective perception of alertness and ability to concentrate and to increases in self-reported tiredness and headache. In exercise lasting more than a few minutes, hypohydration clearly impairs performance capacity, but muscle strength appears to be relatively unaffected.

  abstract      = {Abstract Several infectious agents are considered to be causes of cancer in humans. The fraction of the different types of cancer, and of all cancers worldwide and in different regions, has been estimated using several methods; primarily by reviewing the evidence for the strength of the association (relative risk) and the prevalence of infection in different world areas. The estimated total of infectionâattributable cancer in the year 2002 is 1.9 million cases, or 17.8\% of the global cancer burden. The principal agents are the bacterium Helicobacter pylori (5.5\% of all cancer), the human papilloma viruses (5.2\%), the hepatitis B and C viruses (4.9\%), EpsteinâBarr virus (1\%), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) together with the human herpes virus 8 (0.9\%). Relatively less important causes of cancer are the schistosomes (0.1\%), human Tâcell lymphotropic virus type I (0.03\%) and the liver flukes (0.02\%). There would be 26.3\% fewer cancers in developing countries (1.5 million cases per year) and 7.7\% in developed countries (390,000 cases) if these infectious diseases were prevented. The attributable fraction at the specific sites varies from 100\% of cervix cancers attributable to the papilloma viruses to a tiny proportion (0.4\%) of liver cancers (worldwide) caused by liver flukes.

Second, based on the cognitive theory of multimedia learning, we examine the concept of cognitive overload in which the learner's intended cognitive processing exceeds the learner's available cognitive capacity. Third, we examine five overload scenarios. For each overload scenario, we offer one or two theory-based suggestions for reducing cognitive load, and we summarize our research results aimed at testing the effectiveness of each suggestion. Overall, our analysis shows that cognitive load is a central consideration in the design of multimedia instruction. },

Liver glycogen decreased throughout the period in both groups. Regression lines for fed rats, and for fasting rats from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m., had similar slopes but were some distance apart. The apparently greater effect of glucose in suppressing the formation of FFA in fed rats might be due partly to the additional effect of other calorigenic constituents of the diet interpreted thus, the results were compatible with the hypothesis that regulation of output of FFA from fat depots varies inversely with the total rate of utilization of all calorigenic substances.-E.

By combining one of humankind{\textquoteright}s oldest technologies, textile processing, with electroactive polymers, we demonstrate here the feasibility of wearable, soft artificial muscles made by weaving and knitting, with tunable force and strain. These textile actuators were produced from cellulose yarns assembled into fabrics and coated with conducting polymers using a metal-free deposition. To increase the output force, we assembled yarns in parallel by weaving. The force scaled linearly with the number of yarns in the woven fabric. To amplify the strain, we knitted a stretchable fabric, exhibiting a 53-fold increase in strain. In addition, the textile construction added mechanical stability to the actuators. Textile processing permits scalable and rational production of wearable artificial muscles, and enables novel ways to design assistive devices.},

In the study reported here, we investigated whether sleep-dependent memory consolidation could help to save practice time during relearning. During two sessions occurring 12 hr apart, 40 participants practiced foreign vocabulary until they reached a perfect level of performance. Half of them learned in the morning and relearned in the evening of a single day. The other half learned in the evening of one day, slept, and then relearned in the morning of the next day. Their retention was assessed 1 week later and 6 months later. We found that interleaving sleep between learning sessions not only reduced the amount of practice needed by half but also ensured much better long-term retention. Sleeping after learning is definitely a good strategy, but sleeping between two learning sessions is a better strategy.},

In this paper, I examine evidence that four of these heuristics familiarity, social proof, commitment and scarcity have influenced the decisions of avalanche victims. Using a quantitative method to define the level of hazard exposure in 598 avalanche accidents in the United States, I compare the behavior of the victims when heuristic cues were present to their behavior when these cues were absent. Key findings of this study include: 1) evidence that social proof, commitment, and scarcity traps were significant in many accidents, 2) evidence that group size influenced susceptibility to certain heuristic traps, and 3) evidence that the level of avalanche training in victims influenced their susceptibility to heuristic traps. These findings strongly support the idea that tools for managing heuristic traps are essential for effective avalanche education. },

Many of the largest-sized species occur in the world’s oceans. For many of these, rarity, remoteness, and quite simply the logistics of measuring these giants has made obtaining accurate size measurements difficult. Inaccurate reports of maximum sizes run rampant through the scientific literature and popular media. Moreover, how intraspecific variation in the body sizes of these animals relates to sex, population structure, the environment, and interac- tions with humans remains underappreciated. Here, we review and analyze body size for 25 ocean giants ranging across the animal kingdom. For each taxon we document body size for the largest known marine species of several clades. We also analyze intraspecific variation and identify the largest known individuals for each species. Where data allows, we analyze spatial and temporal intraspecific size variation. We also provide allometric scaling equations between different size measurements as resources to other researchers. In some cases, the lack of data prevents us from fully examining these topics and instead we specifically highlight these deficiencies and the barriers that exist for data collection. Overall, we found considerable variability in intraspecific size distributions from strongly left- to strongly right-skewed. We provide several allometric equations that allow for estimation of total lengths and weights from more easily obtained measurements. In several cases, we also quantify considerable geographic variation and decreases in size likely attributed to humans.},

  abstract      = {Testing has been shown to enhance retention of learned information beyond simple studying, a phenomena known as test-enhanced learning (TEL). Research has shown that TEL effects are greater for tests that require the production of responses [e.g., short-answer questions (SAQs)] relative to tests that require the recognition of correct answers [e.g., multiple-choice questions (MCQs)]. High stakes licensure examinations have recently differentiated MCQs that require the application of clinical knowledge (context-rich MCQs) from MCQs that rely on the recognition of ``facts'' (context-free MCQs). The present study investigated the influence of different types of educational activities (including studying, SAQs, context-rich MCQs and context-free MCQs) on later performance on a mock licensure examination. Fourth-year medical students (nÂ =Â 224) from four Quebec universities completed four educational activities: one reading-based activity and three quiz-based activities (SAQs, context-rich MCQs, and context-free MCQs). We assessed the influence of the type of educational activity on students' subsequent performance in a mock licensure examination, which consisted of two types of context-rich MCQs: (1) verbatim replications of previous items and (2) items that tested the same learning objective but were new. Mean accuracy scores on the mock licensure exam were higher when intervening educational activities contained either context-rich MCQs (Mean z-scoreÂ =Â 0.40) or SAQs (MÂ =Â 0.39) compared to context-free MCQs (MÂ =Â â0.38) or study only items (MÂ =Â â0.42; all pÂ <Â 0.001). Higher mean scores were only present for verbatim items (pÂ <Â 0.001). The benefit of testing was observed when intervening educational activities required either the generation of a response (SAQs) or the application of knowledge (context-rich MCQs); however, this effect was only observed for verbatim test items. These data provide evidence that context-rich MCQs and SAQs enhance learning through testing compared to context-free MCQs or studying alone. The extent to which these findings generalize beyond verbatim questions remains to be seen.},

This assumption is challenged by a bacterial survey of the waters derived from the New Cairngorm National Park, Scotland. Over 480 spot samples were taken for 59 sites between March 2001 and October 2002 during nine field campaigns each of three to five days duration. Over 75% of samples tested positive for Escherichia coli (E. coli) and 85% for total coliforms. Concentrations displayed both temporal and spatial patterns. Largest values occurred over the summer months and particularly at weekends at sites frequented by visitors, either for âwildâ camping or day visits, or where water was drawn from the river for drinking. Overall the spatial and temporal variations in bacterial concentrations suggest a relationship with visitor numbers and in particular wild camping. The implications of the results for drinking water quality and visitors health are discussed along with possible management options for the area in terms of improving the disposal of human waste. },

The high fraction of VCP emissions is consistent with observed urban outdoor and indoor air measurements. We show that human exposure to carbonaceous aerosols of fossil origin is transitioning away from transportation-related sources and toward VCPs.

  abstract      = {Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov was an early 20th century Russian plant scientist who was killed by Joseph
Stalin in 1943 for his adherence to basic genetic principles. Vavilov is well known within plant
breeding and plant evolutionary biology circles, yet the science of Vavilov is just as important to the
field of weed science. Specifically, Vavilov proposed that certain weeds adapted to weed control
practices to survive in prehistorical agrarian societies. Most would refer to this adaption as crop
mimicry, but the term ‘‘Vavilovian mimicry’’ is more apt. Vavilovian mimicry requires three factors:
a model—the crop or desirable plant; a mimic—the weed; and an operator—the discriminating
agent, possibly human, animal, or machine. In a modern context, it is proposed that weed adaptation
to herbicide applications be included as a form of Vavilovian mimicry, with the acknowledgement
that the operator is the herbicide. In this context, Vavilovian mimicry is the adaption of the weed
mimic to be perceived by the operator as visually, physically, or biochemically indistinguishable from
the crop model. This review will cover the history and legacy of Vavilov in a condensed version in the
hope that weed scientists will hold this individual in high regard in our future endeavors and begin to
acknowledge Vavilov as one of the first scientists to propose that weeds can mimic the attributes of
crops.

  abstract      = {Importance There has been recent interest in the findings that the offspring of older fathers have an increased risk of both de novo mutations and neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the offspring of younger parents are also at risk for some adverse mental health outcomes.

Objective To determine the association between maternal and paternal age and a comprehensive range of mental health disorders.

Design, Setting, and Participants A comprehensive, population-based record linkage study using the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register from January 1, 1995, through December 31, 2011. A total of 2 894 688 persons born in Denmark from January 1, 1955, through December 31, 2006, were followed up during the study period.

Exposures Maternal and paternal age at the time of offspring’s birth.

Main Outcomes and Measures We examined a broad range of International Classification of Diseases–defined mental disorders, including substance use; schizophrenia and related disorders; mood disorders; neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders; eating disorders; specific personality disorders; and a range of developmental and childhood disorders. The incidence rate ratios for each mental disorder outcome were estimated by log linear Poisson regression with adjustments for the calendar period, age, sex, and age of the other parent.

Results The cohort was observed for 42.7 million person-years, during which 218 441 members of the cohort had their first psychiatric contact for any psychiatric disorder. Based on the overall risk of psychiatric disorders, the offspring of younger and older parents were at increased risk compared with those of parents aged 25 to 29 years. When the offspring were examined for particular disorders, the nature of the relationship changed. For example, the offspring of older fathers were at an increased risk of schizophrenia and related disorders, mental retardation, and autism spectrum disorders. In contrast, the offspring of young mothers (and to a lesser extent young fathers) were at an increased risk for substance use disorders, hyperkinetic disorders, and mental retardation.

Conclusions and Relevance The offspring of younger mothers and older fathers are at risk for different mental health disorders. These differences can provide clues to the complex risk architecture underpinning the association between parental age and the mental health of offspring.},

  abstract      = {AbstractBackground Using a cross-sectional design comparison, two overhead press techniques (in-front of the head or behind the head) were compared. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of behind the head or in-front of the head overhead pressing technique on shoulder range of movement (ROM) and spine posture. The overhead press is commonly prescribed exercise. The two techniques (in-front of the head or behind the head) may influence joint mechanics and therefore require an objective analysis. Methods Passive shoulder \{ROM\} quantified using goniometric measures, dynamic \{ROM\} utilised three-dimensional (3D) biomechanical measures (120 Hz) of 33 participants performing overhead pressing in a seated position. The timing and synchronisation of the upper limb shoulder and spine segments were quantified and influence of each technique was investigated. Results The in-front technique commenced in lordotic position, whilst behind the head technique commenced in kyphotic position. Behind the head technique started with less thoracic extension than in-front condition. The thoracic spine remained extended and moved between 12° and 15° regardless of gender or technique. The techniques resulted in a significant difference between genders. Males were able to maintain a flat or normal lumbar lordosis, whereas females tended to kyphotic. Conclusion Shoulder \{ROM\} was within passive \{ROM\} for all measures except external rotation for males with the behind the head technique. To avoid possible injury passive \{ROM\} should be increased prior to behind the head protocol. Females showed greater spine movements, suggesting trunk strengthening may assist overhead pressing techniques. For participants with normal trunk stability and ideal shoulder ROM, overhead pressing is a safe exercise (for the shoulder and spine) when performed either in-front of or behind the head.},

  abstract      = {The forelimbs, along with the crania, are an essential part of the prey-killing apparatus in cats. Linear morphometrics of the forelimbs were used to determine the morphological differences between felids that specialize on large prey, small prey, or mixed prey. We also compared the scaling of felid forelimbs to those of canids to test whether prey capture strategies affect forelimb scaling. Results suggest that large prey specialists have relatively robust forelimbs when compared with smaller prey specialists. This includes relatively more robust humeri and radii, relatively larger distal ends of the humerus, and relatively larger articular areas of the humerus and radius. Large prey specialists also had relatively longer olecranon processes of the ulna and wider proximal paws. These characters are all important for subduing large prey while the cat positions itself for the killing bite. Small prey specialists have relatively longer distal limb elements for swift prey capture, and mixed prey specialists had intermediate values with relatively more robust metacarpals. Arboreal felids also had more robust limbs. They had relatively longer proximal phalanges for better grip while climbing, and a relatively short brachial index (radius to humerus ratio). Additionally, we found that felids and canids differ in forelimb scaling, which emphasizes the dual use of forelimbs for locomotion and prey capture in felids. This morphometric technique worked well to separate prey-size preference in felids, but did not work as well to separate locomotor groups, as scansorial and terrestrial felids were not clearly distinguished.

  abstract      = {Background Alcohol and marijuana are the two most abused substances in US colleges. However, research on the combined influence (cross sectional or longitudinal) of these substances on academic performance is currently scant. Methods Data were derived from the longitudinal 2-year Brain and Alcohol Research in College Students (BARCS) study including 1142 freshman students who completed monthly marijuana use and alcohol consumption surveys. Subjects were classified into data-driven groups based on their alcohol and marijuana consumption. A linear mixed-model (LMM) was employed using this grouping factor to predict grade point average (GPA), adjusted for a variety of socio-demographic and clinical factors. Results Three data-driven clusters emerged: 1) No/low users of both, 2) medium-high alcohol/no-low marijuana, and 3) medium-high users of both substances. Individual cluster derivations between consecutive semesters remained stable. No significant interaction between clusters and semester (time) was noted. Post-hoc analysis suggest that at the outset, compared to sober peers, students using moderate to high levels of alcohol and low marijuana demonstrate lower GPAs, but this difference becomes non-significant over time. In contrast, students consuming both substances at moderate-to-high levels score significantly lower at both the outset and across the 2-year investigation period. Our follow-up analysis also indicate that when students curtailed their substance use over time they had significantly higher academic GPA compared to those who remained stable in their substance use patterns over the two year period. Conclusions Overall, our study validates and extends the current literature by providing important implications of concurrent alcohol and marijuana use on academic achievement in college.},

  abstract      = {Abstract Cold-induced vasodilatation (CIVD) is pro-
posed to be a protective response to prevent cold injuries in
the extremities during cold exposure, but the laboratory-
based trainability of CIVD responses in the hand remains
equivocal. Therefore, we investigated the thermal response
across the Wngers with repeated local cold exposure of the
whole hand, along with the transferability of acclimation to
the Wngers of the contralateral hand. Nine healthy subjects
immersed their right hand up to the styloid process in 8°C
water for 30 min daily for 13 days. The left hand was
immersed on days 1 and 13. Skin temperature was recorded
on the pads of the Wve Wngertips and the dorsal surface of the
hand. The presence of CIVD, deWned as an increase in
Wnger skin temperature of 0.5°C at any time during cooling,
occurred in 98.5% of the 585 (9 subjects £ 5 sites £
13 trials) measurements. Seven distinct patterns of thermal responses were evident, including plateaus in Wnger temper-
ature and superimposed waves. The number (N) of CIVD
waves decreased in all digits of the right hand over the accli-
mation period (P = 0.02), from average (SD) values ranging
from 2.7 (1.7) to 3 (1.4) in diVerent digits on day 1, to 1.9
(0.9) and 2.2 (0.7) on day 13. Average (SD) Wnger skin tem-
perature (T avg ) ranged from 11.8 (1.4)°C in Wnger 5 to 12.7
(2.8)°C in Wnger 3 on day 1, and then decreased signiWcantly
(P < 0.001) over the course of the training immersions,
attaining values ranging from 10.8 (0.9)°C in Wnger 4 to
10.9 (0.9)°C in Wnger 2 on day 13. In the contralateral hand,
N was reduced from 2.5 to 1.5 (P < 0.01) and T avg by »2°C
(P < 0.01). No changes were observed in thermal sensation
or comfort of the hand over the acclimation. We conclude
that, under conditions of whole-hand immersion in cold
water, CIVD is not trainable and may lead to systemic atten-
uation of thermal responses to local cooling.

The global anthropogenic P load to freshwater systems from both diffuse and point sources is estimated at 1.5 Tg/yr. More than half of this total load was in Asia, followed by Europe (19%) and Latin America and the Caribbean (13%). The domestic sector contributed 54% to the total, agriculture 38%, and industry 8%. In agriculture, cereals production had the largest contribution to the P load (31%), followed by fruits, vegetables, and oil crops, each contributing 15%. The global total GWF related to anthropogenic P loads is estimated to be 147 Ã 1012 m3/yr, with China contributing 30%, India 8%, USA 7%, and Spain and Brazil 6% each. The basins with WPLâ>â1 (where GWF exceeds the basin's assimilation capacity) together cover about 38% of the global land area, 37% of the global river discharge, and provide residence to about 90% of the global population.},

Findings were broadly similar in most respects, in the two countries. Teachers were thought to intervene fairly often, other children more rarely. Most children had sympathetic attitudes and behaviour toward victims of bullying, but a significant minority, including many self-reported bullies, did not. Girls were more empathic to victims than boys, but were not more likely to intervene. The main cultural difference was that older Italian children were more empathic than younger children, with the reverse difference in England. However in both countries, the likelihood of reported intervention was less with older children.

This is a descriptive correlational study set in seven nursing homes in eastern Iowa. Ninety-eight nursing home residents 65 years of age participated. Exclusion criteria for the study included: unstable congestive heart failure or diabetes, documented renal disease, hyponatremia (serum sodium < 135 meq/L), terminal illness, acutely confused/delirious or urinary tract infection at baseline, and gastrostomy-tube dependence. Weekly urine specimens were collected. Ucol was measured first, using a urine color chart. Usg was determined using the Chemstrip Mini UA Urine Analyzer. Week-by-week Spearman rank order correlations between urine color and specific gravity for the total sample (n = 98) ranged from rs= 0.3 - 0.7, p < .01; the PROC mixed model was significant, p < .01. In subgroup analyses (n = 78), all females (rs= 0.67, p = .01) and both males (rs= 0.53, p = .01) and females (rs= 0.72, p = .01) with adequate renal function (Cockcroft-Gault estimated creatinine clearance [CrCl] values of 50 ml/min) had significant associations between average urine color and average Usg. Females with mild renal impairment (CrCl between 30 and 50 ml/min) also had significant associations between Ucol and Usg (rs= .64, p < .01). Ucol averaged over several individual readings offers another tool in assessing hydration status in Caucasian nursing home residents with ade quate renal function measures by estimated CrCl values. },

  abstract      = {Background: Carlsen and coworkers (1992) reviewed 61 heterogeneous observational studies on semen quality published between 1938 and 1990. This review indicates that mean sperm density decreased significantly between 1940 and 1990. An extended meta-analysis with 101 studies confirmed a decline in sperm density for the period from 1934 to 1996 (2000). The key message of the meta-analyses is that sperm counts have decreased globally by about 50% over the past decades. This assessment has been questioned. Discussion: A major methodological problem of the meta-analysis is the use of data collected in different countries, at different times, on different populations and with different methods of semen analysis. Furthermore, the results of studies concerning semen analysis are frequently biased e.g. by selection criteria of volunteers. In most studies on human semen characteristics the populations under study are insufficiently defined and the study participants are not a representative population sample. The incidence of testicular cancer has increased in Caucasian men worldwide. The investigation of common risk factors for male reproductive disorders requires well designed epidemiological studies and the collection of individual data. Summary: Former meta-analyses of sperm count data show a global downward trend. This conclusion should be interpreted with caution. The included studies are of great heterogeneity due to geographical and/or ethnical variation, different study designs and different methodological standards. Population-based prospective studies are needed to investigate secular trends in male reproductive disorders.},

A 650 bp fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase 1 (CO1) gene has been used successfully for species-level identification in several animal groups. It may be difficult in practice, however, to retrieve a 650 bp fragment from archival specimens, (because of DNA degradation) or from environmental samples (where universal primers are needed).RESULTS:We used a bioinformatics analysis using all CO1 barcode sequences from GenBank and calculated the probability of having species-specific barcodes for varied size fragments. This analysis established the potential of much smaller fragments, mini-barcodes, for identifying unknown specimens. We then developed a universal primer set for the amplification of mini-barcodes. We further successfully tested the utility of this primer set on a comprehensive set of taxa from all major eukaryotic groups as well as archival specimens.CONCLUSION:In this study we address the important issue of minimum amount of sequence information required for identifying species in DNA barcoding. We establish a novel approach based on a much shorter barcode sequence and demonstrate its effectiveness in archival specimens. This approach will significantly broaden the application of DNA barcoding in biodiversity studies.},

Compared with low consumption of milk (<1 glass/day) and high consumption of fruits/vegetables (≥5 servings/day), time-updated information revealed an adjusted hazard ratio for death of 2.79 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.42, 3.21) in women who consumed ≥3 glasses of milk/day and <1 serving/day of fruit/vegetables and a hazard ratio of 1.60 (95% CI: 1.40, 1.82) in women who consumed the same amount of milk but ≥5 servings/day of fruits/vegetables. The same comparisons in men, based on a single food frequency questionnaire, displayed hazard ratios of 1.31 (95% CI: 1.14, 1.51) and 1.07 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.18), respectively. Total antioxidant consumption showed similar patterns as fruit/vegetable intakes. Dietary antioxidant intake, especially in women, seems to modify the elevated death rate associated with high milk consumption.

Recovery of radioactivity ranged from 60-89% of the dose in urine, and from 2-38% of the dose in feces, with most material being excreted during the first 48 hr after dosing. TBR was most extensively metabolized by rabbits and male mice. The primary metabolite excreted by rats and mice was 6-amino-5-[N-methylformylamino]-1-methyluracil (6- AMMU); male mice converted TBR to this metabolite more extensively than did female mice. Rabbits and dogs metabolized TBR primarily to 7- methylxanthine (7-MX) and 3-methylxanthine (3-MX), respectively; the major metabolites excreted by hamsters were 6-AMMU and 7-MX. Overall N- demethylase activity yielding monomethyl metabolites was greatest in rabbits and lowest in rats. Ring N-demethylation at position 3 predominated over 7-N-demethylation in all species except the rat and dog. In dogs, TBR was N-demethylated primarily at position 7, while N- demethylase activity in rats was without apparent positional specificity. Oxidation of methylated xanthines to the corresponding uric acids was a relatively minor metabolic pathway in all species, but had greatest activity in mice. Oxidation of TBR to 3,7-dimethyluric acid was significantly greater in female rats than in male rats. In summary, excretion patterns of TBR and its metabolites were qualitatively similar among species, indicating that TBR is metabolized along similar pathways. Except for the excretion of small quantities of an unidentified but apparently unique metabolite by dogs, only quantitative species- and sex-related differences were observed in the metabolic disposition of TBR.},

Bare hand and facial temperatures in otherwise well-clothed Eskimo men, women, and children were studied during cooling in open air at temperatures between -3 and -7C. Two groups of white men, one composed of individuals accustomed to cold, served for comparison. In contrast to both groups of whites, Eskimo men showed significantly higher minimum finger temperatures, smaller temperature fluctuations during cooling, and higher finger temperatures at termination of exposure. White men less accustomed to cold cooled more rapidly than Eskimo men during initial exposure; white men accustomed to cold cooled at an intermediate rate. Despite an average hand volume less than half that of adult men, Eskimo children maintained finger temperatures as well as white men not accustomed to cold. Two white subjects exhibited a progressively deteriorating type of cooling response in which finger temperatures approached freezing, necessitating early termination of test exposures. Eskimo women reacted in the same manner as Eskimo men. Hand discomfort during cooling was reported absent or minor in adult Eskimos, but was marked in most whites. Eskimo and white adults responded similarly to facial cooling, but cheek temperatures of Eskimo children fell more rapidly.

While chronic intermittent stress is negatively correlated, and exercise positively correlated to LTP induction, we examined whether exercise could mitigate the negative consequences of stress on LTP when co-occurring with stress. Mice were divided into four groups: sedentary no stress, exercise no stress, exercise with stress, and sedentary with stress. Field electrophysiology performed on brain slices confirmed that stress alone significantly reduced dorsal CA1 hippocampal LTP and exercise alone increased LTP compared to controls. Exercise with stress mice exhibited LTP that was significantly greater than mice undergoing stress alone but were not different from sedentary no stress mice. An ELISA illustrated increased corticosterone in stressed mice compared to no stress mice. In addition, a radial arm maze was used to examine behavioral changes in memory during 6â¯weeks of stress and/or exercise. Exercised mice groups made fewer errors in week 2. RT-qPCR was used to examine the mRNA expression of components in the stress and exercise pathways in the four groups. Significant changes in the expression of the following targets were detected: BDNF, TrkB, glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, and dopamine 5 receptors. Collectively, exercise can mitigate some of the negative impact stress has on hippocampal function when both occur concurrently.},

The female flowers of the hop plant are used as a preservative and as a flavoring agent in beer. However, a recurring suggestion has been that hops have a powerful estrogenic activity and that beer may also be estrogenic. In this study, sensitive and specific in vitro bioassays for estrogens were used for an activity-guided fractionation of hops via selective solvent extraction and appropriate HPLC separation. We have identified a potent phytoestrogen in hops, 8-prenylnaringenin, which has an activity greater than other established plant estrogens. The estrogenic activity of this compound was reflected in its relative binding affinity to estrogen receptors from rat uteri. The presence of 8-prenylnaringenin in hops may provide an explanation for the accounts of menstrual disturbances in female hop workers. This phytoestrogen can also be detected in beer, but the levels are low and should not pose any cause for concern.},

  abstract      = {Vaccination against measles has many benefits, not only lifelong protection against this potentially serious virus. Mina et al. analyzed data collected since mass vaccination began in high-income countries when measles was common. Measles vaccination is associated with less mortality from other childhood infections. Measles is known to cause transient immunosuppression, but close inspection of the mortality data suggests that it disables immune memory for 2 to 3 years. Vaccination thus does more than safeguard children against measles; it also stops other infections taking advantage of measles-induced immune damage.Science, this issue p. 694 Immunosuppression after measles is known to predispose people to opportunistic infections for a period of several weeks to months. Using population-level data, we show that measles has a more prolonged effect on host resistance, extending over 2 to 3 years. We find that nonmeasles infectious disease mortality in high-income countries is tightly coupled to measles incidence at this lag, in both the pre- and post-vaccine eras. We conclude that long-term immunologic sequelae of measles drive interannual fluctuations in nonmeasles deaths. This is consistent with recent experimental work that attributes the immunosuppressive effects of measles to depletion of B and T lymphocytes. Our data provide an explanation for the long-term benefits of measles vaccination in preventing all-cause infectious disease. By preventing measles-associated immune memory loss, vaccination protects polymicrobial herd immunity.},

The purpose of this study was to determine whether chronic cold exposure would increase the aerobic capacity of skeletal muscle in UCP-dta mice, a transgenic line lacking brown adipose tissue (BAT). Wild type and UCP-dta mice were acclimated to either warm (23 °C), or cold (4 °C) conditions. Cold increased muscle oxidative capacity nearly equivalently in wild-type and UCP-dta mice, but did not affect the respiratory function of isolated mitochondria. Summit metabolism (View the MathML source) and norepinephrine-induced thermogenesis (View the MathML source) were significantly lower in UCP-dta mice relative to wild-type mice regardless of temperature treatment, but both were significantly higher in cold relative to warm acclimated mice. BAT mass was significantly higher in the cold relative to warm acclimated wild-type mice, but not in cold acclimated UCP-dta mice. BAT citrate synthase activity was lower in transgenic animals regardless of acclimation temperature and BAT citrate synthase activity per depot was significantly higher only in the cold acclimated wild-type mice. Muscle citrate synthase activity was increased in both genotypes. As defects in muscle oxidative function have been observed with obesity and type 2 diabetes, these results suggest that chronic cold exposure is a useful intervention to drive skeletal muscle oxidative capacity in mouse models of obesity.},

In numerous follow-up studies over 40 years, this ‘test’ proved to have surprisingly significant predictive validity for consequential social, cognitive and mental health outcomes over the life course. In this article, we review key findings from the longitudinal work and from earlier delay-of-gratification experiments examining the cognitive appraisal and attention control strategies that underlie this ability. Further, we outline a set of hypotheses that emerge from the intersection of these findings with research on ‘cognitive control’ mechanisms and their neural bases. We discuss implications of these hypotheses for decomposing the phenomena of ‘willpower’ and the lifelong individual differences in self-regulatory ability that were identified in the earlier research and that are currently being pursued.

  abstract      = {Neonicotinoid pesticides are applied globally. Concern about their impacts has been increasing as evidence for negative effects on bee health and persistence has accumulated. Mitchell et al. looked at the prevalence of these pesticides in honey from across the world and found traces in the majority of samples tested (see the Perspective by Connolly). The neonicotinoid compounds occurred at levels considered safe for human consumption, but the contamination confirms the inundation of bees and their environments with these pesticides, despite some recent efforts to decrease their use.Science, this issue p. 109; see also p. 38Growing evidence for global pollinator decline is causing concern for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services maintenance. Neonicotinoid pesticides have been identified or suspected as a key factor responsible for this decline. We assessed the global exposure of pollinators to neonicotinoids by analyzing 198 honey samples from across the world. We found at least one of five tested compounds (acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam) in 75\% of all samples, 45\% of samples contained two or more of these compounds, and 10\% contained four or five. Our results confirm the exposure of bees to neonicotinoids in their food throughout the world. The coexistence of neonicotinoids and other pesticides may increase harm to pollinators. However, the concentrations detected are below the maximum residue level authorized for human consumption (average {\textpm} standard error for positive samples: 1.8 {\textpm} 0.56 nanograms per gram).},

The aim of this study was to prospectively investigate the impact of practice distribution (weekly vs monthly) on complex motor skill (end-side vascular anastomosis) acquisition and 4-month retention. Twenty-four surgical interns were randomly assigned to weekly training for 4 weeks or monthly training for 4 months, with equal total training times. Performance was assessed before training, immediately after training, after the completion of distributed training, and 4 months later. There was no statistical difference in surgical skill acquisition and retention between the weekly and monthly scheduled groups, as measured by procedural checklist scores, global rating scores of operative performance, final product analysis, and overall performance or assessment of operative âcompetence.â Distributed practice results in improvement and retention of a newly acquired surgical skill independent of weekly or monthly practice schedules. Flexibility in a surgical skills laboratory curriculum is possible without adversely affecting training.},

The basis of this apparent randomness is not understood. We show that before X-inactivation, the two X chromosomes appear to exist in distinct states that correspond to their fates as the active and inactive X chromosomes. Xist and Tsix, noncoding RNAs that control X chromosome fates upon X-inactivation, also determine the states of the X chromosomes prior to X-inactivation. In wild-type ES cells, X chromosomes switch between states; among the progeny of a single cell, a given X chromosome exhibits each state with equal frequency. We propose a model in which the concerted switching of homologous X chromosomes between mutually exclusive future active and future inactive states provides the basis for the apparently random silencing of one X chromosome in female cells.},

Moeller et al. have developed a method to compare rapidly evolving gyrB gene sequences in fecal samples from humans and wild chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas (see the Perspective by Segre and Salafsky). Comparison of the gyrB phylogenies of major bacterial lineages reveals that they mostly match the apehominid phylogeny, except for some rare symbiont transfers between primate species. Gut bacteria therefore are not simply acquired from the environment, but have coevolved for millions of years with hominids to help shape our immune systems and development.Science, this issue p. 380; see also p. 350The evolutionary origins of the bacterial lineages that populate the human gut are unknown. Here we show that multiple lineages of the predominant bacterial taxa in the gut arose via cospeciation with humans, chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas over the past 15 million years. Analyses of strain-level bacterial diversity within hominid gut microbiomes revealed that clades of Bacteroidaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae have been maintained exclusively within host lineages across hundreds of thousands of host generations. Divergence times of these cospeciating gut bacteria are congruent with those of hominids, indicating that nuclear, mitochondrial, and gut bacterial genomes diversified in concert during hominid evolution. This study identifies human gut bacteria descended from ancient symbionts that speciated simultaneously with humans and the African apes.},

The abnormal isoforms of the prion protein in these two diseases were found to differ both in the relative abundance of glycosylated forms and in the size of the protease-resistant fragments. The size difference was consistent with a different protease cleavage site, suggesting a different conformation of the protease-resistant prion protein present in the two diseases. These differences are likely to be responsible for the type and location of the lesions that characterize these two diseases. Therefore, the combination of the mutation at codon 178 and the polymorphism at codon 129 determines the disease phenotype by producing two altered conformations of the prion protein.},

Mainly due to the availability of artificial lighting, modern humans have been able to modify their natural daily cycles. In addition, social rules, like those related to work and schooling, tend to require specific schedules for the daily activities. However, it is not fully understood to what extent the seasonal changes in sunrise and sunset times and the length of daylight could influence the timings of these activities. In this study, we use a new approach to describe the dynamics of human resting periods in terms of mobile phone calling activity, showing that the onset and termination of the resting pattern of urban humans follow the east-west sun progression inside the same timezone. Also we find that the onset of the low calling activity period as well as its mid-time, are subjected to seasonal changes, following the same dynamics as solar midnight. Moreover, with resting time measured as the low activity periods of people in cities, we discover significant behavioural differences between different age and gender cohorts. These findings suggest that the length and timings of the human daily rhythms, still have a sensitive dependence on the seasonal changes of the sunlight.},

On four different occasions, eight endurance-trained cyclists [age 23 +/- 3 (SD) yr, body wt 71.9 +/- 11.6 kg, maximal O2 consumption 4.72 +/- 0.33 l/min] cycled at a power output equal to 62-67\% maximal O2 consumption for 2 h in a warm environment (33 degrees C dry bulb, 50\% relative humidity, wind speed 2.5 m/s). During exercise, they randomly received no fluid (NF) or ingested a small (SF), moderate (MF), or large (LF) volume of fluid that replaced 20 +/- 1, 48 +/- 1, and 81 +/- 2\%, respectively, of the fluid lost in sweat during exercise. The protocol resulted in graded magnitudes of dehydration as body weight declined 4.2 +/- 0.1, 3.4 +/- 0.1, 2.3 +/- 0.1, and 1.1 +/- 0.1\%, respectively, during NF, SF, MF, and LF. After 2 h of exercise, esophageal temperature (Tes), HR, and SV were significantly different among the four trials (P \&lt; 0.05), with the exception of NF and SF. The magnitude of dehydration accrued after 2 h of exercise in the four trials was linearly related with the increase in Tes (r = 0.98, P \&lt; 0.02), the increase in HR (r = 0.99, P \&lt; 0.01), and the decline in SV (r = 0.99, P \&lt; 0.01). LF attenuated hyperthermia, apparently because of higher skin blood flow, inasmuch as forearm blood flow was 20{\textendash}22\% higher than during SF and NF at 105 min (P \&lt; 0.05). There were no differences in sweat rate among the four trials. In each subject, the increase in Tes from 20 to 120 min of exercise was highly correlated to the increase in serum osmolality (r = 0.81-0.98, P \&lt; 0.02-0.19) and the increase in serum sodium concentration (r = 0.87-0.99, P \&lt; 0.01-0.13) from 5 to 120 min of exercise. In summary, the magnitude of increase in core temperature and HR and the decline in SV are graded in proportion to the amount of dehydration accrued during exercise.},

calorie, low-fat diet; frequent self-monitoring of weight), a few to the cognitive component
(eg, reduced disinhibition, satisfaction with results achieved, confidence in being able to lose
weight without professional help), and a few to personality traits (eg, low novelty seeking) and
patient–therapist interaction. Trials based on the most recent protocols of lifestyle modification,
with a prolonged extended treatment after the weight loss phase, have also shown promising
long-term weight loss results. These data should stimulate the adoption of a lifestyle modification-
based approach for the management of obesity, featuring a nonphysician lifestyle counselor
(also called “lifestyle trainer” or “healthy lifestyle practitioner”) as a pivotal component of the
multidisciplinary team. The obesity physicians maintain a primary role in engaging patients,
in team coordination and supervision, in managing the complications associated with obesity
and, in selected cases, in the decision for drug treatment or bariatric surgery, as possible more
intensive, add-on interventions to lifestyle treatment.

  abstract      = {The Montreal Protocol was designed to protect the stratospheric ozone layer by enabling reductions in the abundance of ozone-depleting substances such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in the atmosphere1â3. The reduction in the atmospheric concentration of trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11) has made the second-largest contribution to the decline in the total atmospheric concentration of ozone-depleting chlorine since the 1990s 1 . However, CFC-11âstill contributes one-quarter of all chlorine reaching the stratosphere, and a timely recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer depends on a sustained decline in CFC-11 concentrations 1 . Here we show that the rate of decline of atmospheric CFC-11 concentrations observed at remote measurement sites was constant from 2002 to 2012, and then slowed by about 50 per cent after 2012. The observed slowdown in the decline of CFC-11 concentration was concurrent with a 50 per cent increase in the mean concentration difference observed between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, and also with the emergence of strong correlations at the Mauna Loa Observatory between concentrations of CFC-11 and other chemicals associated with anthropogenic emissions. A simple model analysis of our findings suggests an increase in CFC-11 emissions of 13âÂ±â5 gigagrams per year (25âÂ±â13 per cent) since 2012, despite reported production being close to zero 4 since 2006. Our three-dimensional model simulations confirm the increase in CFC-11 emissions, but indicate that this increase may have been as much as 50 per cent smaller as a result of changes in stratospheric processes or dynamics. The increase in emission of CFC-11 appears unrelated to past production; this suggests unreported new production, which is inconsistent with the Montreal Protocol agreement to phase out global CFC production by 2010.},

Any study design was eligible for inclusion.Results 72 studies were eligible for inclusion: 38 reporting training outcomes, 31 reporting outcomes in patients, and three reporting both. A reduction in working hours from greater than 80 hours a week (in accordance with US recommendations) does not seem to have adversely affected patient safety and has had limited effect on postgraduate training. Reports on the impact of European legislation limiting working hours to less than 56 or 48 a week are of poor quality and have conflicting results, meaning that firm conclusions cannot be made.Conclusions Reducing working hours to less than 80 a week has not adversely affected outcomes in patient or postgraduate training in the US. The impact of reducing hours to less than 56 or 48 a week in the UK has not yet been sufficiently evaluated in high quality studies. Further work is required, particularly in the European Union, using large multicentre evaluations of the impact of duty hours{\textquoteright} legislation on objective educational and clinical outcomes.},

We measured the following parameters: (i) the degree of sperm aggregation, velocity and proportion of morphologically normal sperm after 1 and 3 h incubation in undiluted semen samples, (ii) the proportion of viable sperm plus the same parameters as in (i) in 'swim-up' sperm suspensions after 1 and 3 h incubation, (iii) the degree of self and non-self sperm aggregation using fluorescent dyes to distinguish the sperm of different males, and (iv) the extent of sperm capacitation and acrosome-reacted sperm in mixtures of sperm from the same and different males. We observed very few significant changes in sperm aggregation or performance in mixtures of sperm from different males compared with mixtures from the same male and none that were consistent with previously reported findings. The incapacitation of rival sperm therefore seems an unlikely mechanism of sperm competition in humans.},

Furthermore, we found that coevolution with the pathogen rapidly drove obligately selfing populations to extinction, whereas outcrossing populations persisted through reciprocal coevolution. Thus, consistent with the Red Queen hypothesis, coevolving pathogens can select for biparental sex.},

Prior studies have primarily focused on studentsâ capacity for multitasking and distraction when using laptops. The present research suggests that even when laptops are used solely to take notes, they may still be impairing learning because their use results in shallower processing. In three studies, we found that students who took notes on laptops performed worse on conceptual questions than students who took notes longhand. We show that whereas taking more notes can be beneficial, laptop note takersâ tendency to transcribe lectures verbatim rather than processing information and reframing it in their own words is detrimental to learning. },

Specifically, we show that male aggression is targeted towards the most fecund females, is associated with high male mating success and is costly for the victims. Such aggression can be viewed as a counter-strategy to female attempts at paternity confusion, and a cost of multi-male mating.},

  abstract      = {Thyroid hormone (TH) is required for normal development as well as regulating metabolism in the adult. The thyroid hormone receptor (TR) isoforms, Î± and Î², are differentially expressed in tissues and have distinct roles in TH signaling. Local activation of thyroxine (T(4)), to the active form, triiodothyronine (T(3)), by 5â²-deiodinase type 2 (D2) is a key mechanism of TH regulation of metabolism. D2 is expressed in the hypothalamus, white fat, brown adipose tissue (BAT), and skeletal muscle and is required for adaptive thermogenesis. The thyroid gland is regulated by thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). In addition to TRH/TSH regulation by TH feedback, there is central modulation by nutritional signals, such as leptin, as well as peptides regulating appetite. The nutrient status of the cell provides feedback on TH signaling pathways through epigentic modification of histones. Integration of TH signaling with the adrenergic nervous system occurs peripherally, in liver, white fat, and BAT, but also centrally, in the hypothalamus. TR regulates cholesterol and carbohydrate metabolism through direct actions on gene expression as well as cross-talk with other nuclear receptors, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), liver X receptor (LXR), and bile acid signaling pathways. TH modulates hepatic insulin sensitivity, especially important for the suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis. The role of TH in regulating metabolic pathways has led to several new therapeutic targets for metabolic disorders. Understanding the mechanisms and interactions of the various TH signaling pathways in metabolism will improve our likelihood of identifying effective and selective targets.},

Sixty healthy recreational male runners (age = 35.6 Â± 11.7 years old, body mass index = 22.9 Â± 2.4 kg/m2) performed trials in shod/barefoot running conditions on a treadmill at self-selected comfortable and demanding speeds. Photogrammetric techniques (2D) were employed. In barefoot conditions, contact time was shorter (p &lt; 0.001) at demanding speed, flight time was shorter at comfortable (p &lt; 0.05) and demanding (p &lt; 0.05) speeds, and there was greater stride frequency at both speeds (p &lt; 0.001). In addition, in barefoot conditions, runners landed with significantly greater knee flexion (p &lt; 0.05); lower ankle dorsiflexion (p &lt; 0.001); and lower knee flexion in take-off at demanding speed (p = 0.002) compared with shod conditions. In conclusion, the current study has provided evidence to suggest that acute changes occur in the temporal variables and kinematics between shod/barefoot conditions at low and high speeds in habitually shod runners. Significant differences were found in spatialâtemporal events between shod/barefoot conditions, with shorter times in barefoot conditions with greater knee flexion and ankle dorsiflexion. When speed was increased in barefoot conditions, duration of timing variables decreased significantly both comfortable and demanding speed (p &lt; 0.001). Because of this, stride and gait cycle was significantly faster and thus there was a higher stride frequency.},

  abstract      = {Using powerful jet propulsion, some squid species are able to exit the water and become airborne; this is a common behavior seen throughout the world's oceans. However, direct scientific observation is rare, with most studies relying on anecdotal evidence and limited photographic documentation. Here, we examine the flying behavior of young oceanic squid (Ommastrephidae) observed in sequential photographs taken in the Northwest Pacific (35o34.0{\textasciiacutex}N, 146o19.3{\textasciiacutex}E) on July 25, 2011. We define four phases in the flight process: launching, jetting, gliding and diving. During flight, squid actively change their aerial posture and attitude depending on the flight phase and their distance from the water. The present study demonstrated that flight of squid is not simple gliding after incidental exit from the water, but involves jet propulsion, generation of lift force and control of different body postures in different flight phases, which have evolved to enhance escape from predators.},

  abstract      = { There is a rich scientific literature regarding hydration status and physical function that began in the late 1800s, although the relationship was likely apparent centuries before that. A decrease in body water from normal levels (often referred to as dehydration or hypohydration) provokes changes in cardiovascular, thermoregulatory, metabolic, and central nervous function that become increasingly greater as dehydration worsens. Similarly, performance impairment often reported with modest dehydration (e.g., â2\% body mass) is also exacerbated by greater fluid loss. Dehydration during physical activity in the heat provokes greater performance decrements than similar activity in cooler conditions, a difference thought to be due, at least in part, to greater cardiovascular and thermoregulatory strain associated with heat exposure. There is little doubt that performance during prolonged, continuous exercise in the heat is impaired by levels of dehydration â¥ â2\% body mass, and there is some evidence that lower levels of dehydration can also impair performance even during relatively short-duration, intermittent exercise. Although additional research is needed to more fully understand low-level dehydration's effects on physical performance, one can generalize that when performance is at stake, it is better to be well-hydrated than dehydrated. This generalization holds true in the occupational, military, and sports settings. },

Recent evidence demonstrates that sleepâwake and circadian disruption often occur early in the course of the disease and may even precede the development of cognitive symptoms. Furthermore, the sleepâwake cycle appears to regulate levels of the pathogenic amyloid-beta peptide in the brain, and manipulating sleep can influence AD-related pathology in mouse models via multiple mechanisms. Finally, the circadian clock system, which controls the sleepâwake cycle and other diurnal oscillations in mice and humans, may also have a role in the neurodegenerative process. In this review, we examine the current literature related to the mechanisms by which sleep and circadian rhythms might impact AD pathogenesis, and we discuss potential therapeutic strategies targeting these systems for the prevention of AD.},

Here we report that C3 grains and legumes have lower concentrations of zinc and iron when grown under field conditions at the elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration predicted for the middle of this century. C3 crops other than legumes also have lower concentrations of protein, whereas C4 crops seem to be less affected. Differences between cultivars of a single crop suggest that breeding for decreased sensitivity to atmospheric CO2 concentration could partly address these new challenges to global health.},

embracing a position, long-held in cognitive psychology, that recognizes memory as a

reflects processes akin to those that stabilized the memory following acquisition.},

Excessive foot loading has been suggested as a potential cause for these problems [Bennell, K, Matheson G, Meeuwisse W, Brukner P. Risk factors for stress fractures. Sports Med 1999;28(2):91â122]. Therefore, the question arises whether long distance running affects foot loading characteristics like ground reaction forces and peak pressure in specific areas of the foot. To investigate the effects of long distance running on plantar pressure patterns before and after a marathon race. Repeated measurements of recreational runners before and after a marathon race. Two hundred participants of the third Muenster marathon, 2004, were measured before and after the race with plantar pressure measurements during barefoot walking on a capacitive platform. The ratio between forefoot and toe loading was calculated to assess a suggested loading shift between these areas. The results of the whole group of participants revealed a significant difference in foot loading characteristics before and after the race. Post-race peak pressure and impulse values were higher in the forefoot regions and reduced under the toes. The increased peak pressure under the metatarsal heads after the race indicates a load shift from the toes to the metatarsal heads. This suggests an increased loading of the metatarsal bones and could explain the increased incidence of metatarsal stress fractures in long distance runners.},

Understanding both the economic benefits and costs of conserving ecosystems will help to allocate scarce dollars most efficiently. However, although cost-benefit analyses are common in many areas of policy, they are not typically used in conservation planning. We conducted a spatial evaluation of the costs and benefits of conservation for a landscape in the Atlantic forests of Paraguay. We considered five ecosystem services (i.e., sustainable bushmeat harvest, sustainable timber harvest, bioprospecting for pharmaceutical products, existence value, and carbon storage in aboveground biomass) and compared them to estimates of the opportunity costs of conservation. We found a high degree of spatial variability in both costs and benefits over this relatively small (~3,000 km2) landscape. Benefits exceeded costs in some areas, with carbon storage dominating the ecosystem service values and swamping opportunity costs. Other benefits associated with conservation were more modest and exceeded costs only in protected areas and indigenous reserves. We used this cost-benefit information to show that one potential corridor between two large forest patches had net benefits that were three times greater than two otherwise similar alternatives. Spatial cost-benefit analysis can powerfully inform conservation planning, even though the availability of relevant data may be limited, as was the case in our study area. It can help us understand the synergies between biodiversity conservation and economic development when the two are indeed aligned and to clearly understand the trade-offs when they are not.},

The need for personal and potable water treatment devices has evolved from consumer interest in improving and ensuring the quality of drinking water. Such devices are especially useful to hikers and campers who often must use available surface water supplies. A portable iodinated water purification system was evaluated for the ability 10 inactivate/remove Klebsiella terrigena, poliovirus type 1, rotavirus SA-11 and Cryptosporidium oocysts under a variety of different water quality conditions: <1.0–10mg/L total organic carbon, turbidity 1–30NTU and total dissolved solids 200–1,500mg/L. The units were tested at room temperature and 4°C. The results showed that the system can achieve a geometric average removal of 6 log10 for Klebsiella terrigena, 4 log10 for poliovirus type 1 and rotavirus SA-11, and 3 log10 of Cryptosporidium occysts.

  abstract      = {Summary Do all animals sleep? Sleep has been observed in many vertebrates, and there is a growing body of evidence for sleep-like states in arthropods and nematodes [1â5]. Here we show that sleep is also present in Cnidaria [6â8], an earlier-branching metazoan lineage. Cnidaria and Ctenophora are the first metazoan phyla to evolve tissue-level organization and differentiated cell types, such as neurons and muscle [9â15]. In Cnidaria, neurons are organized into aÂ non-centralized radially symmetric nerve net [11,Â 13, 15â17] that nevertheless shares fundamental properties with the vertebrate nervous system: action potentials, synaptic transmission, neuropeptides, and neurotransmitters [15â20]. It was reported that cnidarian soft corals [21] and box jellyfish [22, 23] exhibit periods of quiescence, a pre-requisite for sleep-like states, prompting us to ask whether sleep is present in Cnidaria. Within Cnidaria, the upside-down jellyfish Cassiopea spp. displays a quantifiable pulsing behavior, allowing us to perform long-term behavioral tracking. Monitoring of Cassiopea pulsing activity for consecutive days and nights revealed behavioral quiescence at night that is rapidly reversible, as well as a delayed response to stimulation in the quiescent state. When deprived of nighttime quiescence, Cassiopea exhibited decreased activity and reduced responsiveness to a sensory stimulus during the subsequent day, consistent with homeostatic regulation of the quiescent state. Together, these results indicate that Cassiopea has a sleep-like state, supporting the hypothesis that sleep arose early in the metazoan lineage, prior to the emergence of a centralized nervous system. },

Information was based on self-reports. The psychosocial factors were represented by an average of scores on 3-12 single items, each with 5 possible response categories. Bullying behavior was defined as bullying other pupils sometimes or more often during the term. The prevalence of bullying behavior was 9.2\\%, but significantly higher among boys than girls. Odds ratios of bullying behavior according to psychosocial factors were calculated in a multiple logistic regression analysis. Increasing school alienation was associated with an increased risk of bullying, whereas increasing support from teachers and peers decreased the risk. Increasing self-efficacy was associated with a significant increase in risk only among 14-year-old pupils, but a similar tendency was seen for 15-year-old pupils. No significant association was seen with decision control.

Building on animal research and early correlational human studies linking the sex steroid hormone testosterone with hierarchical social interactions, we investigate the influence of testosterone on menâs preferences for positional goods. Using a placebo-controlled experiment (Nâ=â243) to measure individualsâ desire for status brands and products, we find that administering testosterone increases menâs preference for status brands, compared to brands of similar perceived quality but lower perceived status. Furthermore, testosterone increases positive attitudes toward positional goods when they are described as status-enhancing, but not when they are described as power-enhancing or high in quality. Our results provide novel causal evidence for the biological roots of menâs preferences for status, bridging decades of animal behavioral studies with contemporary consumer research.},

  abstract      = {Caffeine is probably the most frequently ingested pharmacologically active substance in the world. It is found in common beverages (coffee, tea, soft drinks), in products containing cocoa or chocolate, and in medications. Because of its wide consumption at different levels by most segments of the population, the public and the scientific community have expressed interest in the potential for caffeine to produce adverse effects on human health. The possibility that caffeine ingestion adversely affects human health was investigated based on reviews of (primarily) published human studies obtained through a comprehensive literature search. Based on the data reviewed, it is concluded that for the healthy adult population, moderate daily caffeine intake at a dose level up to 400 mg day-1 (equivalent to 6 mg kg-1 body weight day-1 in a 65-kg person) is not associated with adverse effects such as general toxicity, cardiovascular effects, effects on bone status and calcium balance (with consumption of adequate calcium), changes in adult behaviour, increased incidence of cancer and effects on male fertility. The data also show that reproductive-aged women and children are âat riskâ subgroups who may require specific advice on moderating their caffeine intake. Based on available evidence, it is suggested that reproductive-aged women should consume â©½ 300 mg caffeine per day (equivalent to 4.6 mg kg-1 bw day-1 for a 65-kg person) while children should consume â©½ 2.5 mg kg-1 bw day-1.},

We reanalysed 1472 population-based studies, with measurement of height on more than 18.6 million participants to estimate mean height for people born between 1896 and 1996 in 200 countries. The largest gain in adult height over the past century has occurred in South Korean women and Iranian men, who became 20.2 cm (95% credible interval 17.5–22.7) and 16.5 cm (13.3–19.7) taller, respectively. In contrast, there was little change in adult height in some sub-Saharan African countries and in South Asia over the century of analysis. The tallest people over these 100 years are men born in the Netherlands in the last quarter of 20th century, whose average heights surpassed 182.5 cm, and the shortest were women born in Guatemala in 1896 (140.3 cm; 135.8–144.8).

We exploited breed phylogeny and reports of drug sensitivity to survey other purebred populations that might be genetically at risk. We found that the same allele, mdr1-1{Delta}, segregated in seven additional breeds, including two sighthounds that were not expected to share collie ancestry. A mutant haplotype that was conserved among affected breeds indicated that the allele was identical by descent. Based on breed histories and the extent of linkage disequilibrium, we conclude that all dogs carrying mdr1-1{Delta} are descendants of a dog that lived in Great Britain before the genetic isolation of breeds by registry (ca. 1873). The breed distribution and frequency of mdr1-1{Delta} have applications in veterinary medicine and selective breeding, whereas the allele's history recounts the emergence of formally recognized breeds from an admixed population of working sheepdogs. },

Therefore this study compared the number of weighted knee extension lifts that could be done after spending 1Â h in either dim or bright light. Methods Participants (5 women, 11 men, college students 19â26 years) performed knee extension lifts to exhaustion with a load approximating 40% of their body weight. The lifts to exhaustion were measured immediately following 1Â h of exposure to each of the following three conditions: dark (DL), room light (RL), and room light plus 5Â mg melatonin (RLM). A minimum of 48Â h separated each condition, and all participants started the exposures in a rested fed condition. Results Average (Â±SD) number of knee extension lifts for \{RL\} (62.0Â Â±Â 22.0) was significantly (pÂ &lt;Â 0.05) greater than \{DL\} (51.4Â Â±Â 14.7) and \{RLM\} (57.8Â Â±Â 22.9). The number of \{RLM\} knee extension lifts was not significantly different from DL. Exposure to 1Â h of dim light immediately prior to activity can result in a reduction in thigh muscle endurance. The decline in performance to short-term dim light exposure was similar to that found following longer-term exposure. Conclusion It appears that light intensity can influence muscle endurance, however, at this time this effect cannot be directly related to endogenous melatonin production. },

The legitimacy (high versus low) of the rules governing the use of a handball court, and the extent to which the group's claim to the court was consistent with the rules (high versus low), were also manipulated. The participants' liking, causal attribution, deservingness, and punishment responses to an intergroup bullying episode instigated by the group of boys against children from another class indicated that the participants recognised the import of the situational variables and, at least to some extent, took them into account. Nevertheless, the results indicated that the children favoured the bully group, and that their responses systematically reflected this bias. Possible bases for understanding these effects are discussed.},

This article reviews evidence relevant to the hypothesis that natural selection for shorter sleep time in humans has compromised the efficacy of physiological mechanisms that protect against AD during sleep. In particular, the glymphatic system drains interstitial fluid from the brain, removing extra-cellular amyloid beta (eAβ) twice as fast during sleep. In addition, melatonin—a peptide hormone that increases markedly during sleep—is an effective antioxidant that inhibits the polymerization of soluble eAβ into insoluble amyloid fibrils that are associated with AD. Sleep deprivation increases plaque formation and AD, which itself disrupts sleep, potentially creating a positive feedback cycle. These and other physiological benefits of sleep may be compromised by short sleep durations. Our hypothesis highlights possible long-term side effects of medications that reduce sleep, and may lead to potential new strategies for preventing and treating AD.

Lactobacillus reuteri ATCCPTA 6475 (L. reuteri 6475) has been reported to increase bone mineral density (BMD) in mice but its effect on the human skeleton is unknown. The objective of this trial was to investigate if L. reuteri 6475 affects bone loss in older women with low BMD. In this doubleâblind, placeboâcontrolled study, women from the population who were 75 to 80 years old and had low BMD were randomized to orally receive 1010 colonyâforming units of L. reuteri 6475 daily or placebo. The predefined primary endâpoint was relative change after 12 months in tibia total volumetric BMD (vBMD). Ninety women were included and 70 completed the study. L. reuteri 6475 reduced loss of total vBMD compared to placebo both in the intentionâtoâtreat (ITT) analysis (â0.83\% [95\% confidence interval [CI], â1.47 to â0.19\%] vs. â1.85\% [95\% CI, â2.64 to â1.07\%]; mean difference 1.02\% [95\% CI, 0.02 to 2.03]) and per protocol analysis (â0.93\% [95\% CI, â1.45 to â0.40] vs. â1.86\% [95\% CI, â2.35 to â1.36]; mean difference 0.93\% [95\% CI, 0.21 to 1.65]. In general, similar but smaller effects were observed in the secondary bone variable outcomes, but these differences did not reach statistical significance in the ITT population. Adverse events did not differ between groups. In conclusion, supplementation with L. reuteri 6475 should be further explored as a novel approach to prevent ageâassociated bone loss and osteoporosis. This article is protected by copyright.

Liver glycogen content was determined in specimens obtained by repeated
percutaneous biopsies during starvation and under various dietary conditions
in 19 human subjects. During rest and following an overnight fast, there was
a decrease in liver glycogen content by a mean of 0.30 mmol glucosyl units
per kg wet liver tissue per min during a further 4 hours’ starvation. Prolonged
starvation or carbohydrate-poor normocaloric diet decreased the liver glyco-
gen from a mean of 232 to 24-55 mmol glucosyl units per kg within 24 hours.
During an additional period of up to 9 days on the carbohydrate-poor diet
the liver glycogen remained at a low level. Refeeding with a carbohydrate-
rich diet gave a rapid increase of the liver glycogen to supernormal values,
424-624 mmol glucosyl units per kg wet liver tissue.

A calibration curve (absorbance versus concentration) is constructed for iron +II and the concentration of the unknown iron sample is determined. Theory Colorimetric analysis is based on the change in the intensity of the colour of a solution with variations in concentration. Colorimetric methods represent the simplest form of absorption analysis. The human eye is used to compare the colour of the sample solution with a set of standards until a match is found.},

By 1996, all exercisers were advised to drink âas much as tolerableâ in order to insure that they did not lose any weight during exercise â the âzero percent dehydrationâ doctrine. This advice requires that athletes drink enough to âstay ahead of thirstâ. The act of drinking is a basic survival instinct that has been regulated by complex, unconscious controls ever since the first fish-like creatures moved onto land and should not require conscious adjustment. <i>Methods:</i> Literature survey of all studies comparing the effects of drinking to thirst (ad libitum) and drinking to prevent any weight loss during exercise â the âzero percent dehydrationâ doctrine. <i>Result:</i> No study found that drinking more than ad libitum during exercise produced any biological advantage, but it could cause exercise-associated hyponatremia. <i>Conclusion:</i> Drinking ad libitum appears to optimize performance and safety during exercise in many situations. The presence of thirst, not of water loss, may be the biological signal that impairs exercise performance in those who drink less than their thirst dictates during exercise.},

  abstract      = {Tea is the most widely consumed beverage in the world after water. Tea is known to be a rich source of flavonoid antioxidants. However tea also contains a unique amino acid, L-theanine that may modulate aspects of brain function in humans. Evidence from human electroencephalograph (EEG) studies show that it has a direct effect on the brain (Juneja et al. Trends in Food Science & Tech 1999;10;199-204). L-theanine significantly increases activity in the alpha frequency band which indicates that it relaxes the mind without inducing drowsiness. However, this effect has only been established at higher doses than that typically found in a cup of black tea (approximately 20mg). The aim of the current research was to establish this effect at more realistic dietary levels. EEG was measured in healthy, young participants at baseline and 45, 60, 75, 90 and 105 minutes after ingestion of 50mg L-theanine (n=16) or placebo (n=19). Participants were resting with their eyes closed during EEG recording. There was a greater increase in alpha activity across time in the L-theanine condition (relative to placebo (p+0.05). A second study replicated this effect in participants engaged in passive activity. These data indicate that L-theanine, at realistic dietary levels, has a significant effect on the general state of mental alertness or arousal. Furthermore, alpha activity is known to play an important role in critical aspects of attention, and further research is therefore focussed on understanding the effect of L-theanine on attentional processes.},

  abstract      = {The 32 mutation at the CCR5 locus is a well-studied example of natural selection acting in humans. The mutation is found principally in Europe and western Asia, with higher frequencies generally in the north. Homozygous carriers of the 32 mutation are resistant to HIV-1 infection because the mutation prevents functional expression of the CCR5 chemokine receptor normally used by HIV-1 to enter CD4+ T cells. HIV has emerged only recently, but population genetic data strongly suggest 32 has been under intense selection for much of its evolutionary history. To understand how selection and dispersal have interacted during the history of the 32 allele, we implemented a spatially explicit model of the spread of 32. The model includes the effects of sampling, which we show can give rise to local peaks in observed allele frequencies. In addition, we show that with modest gradients in selection intensity, the origin of the 32 allele may be relatively far from the current areas of highest allele frequency. The geographic distribution of the 32 allele is consistent with previous reports of a strong selective advantage (>10%) for 32 carriers and of dispersal over relatively long distances (>100 km/generation). When selection is assumed to be uniform across Europe and western Asia, we find support for a northern European origin and long-range dispersal consistent with the Viking-mediated dispersal of 32 proposed by G. Lucotte and G. Mercier. However, when we allow for gradients in selection intensity, we estimate the origin to be outside of northern Europe and selection intensities to be strongest in the northwest. Our results describe the evolutionary history of the 32 allele and establish a general methodology for studying the geographic distribution of selected alleles.},

Primates vary in their sleep durations and, remarkably, humans sleep the least per 24-hr period of the 30 primates that have been studied. Using phylogenetic methods that quantitatively situate human phenotypes within a broader primate comparative context, we investigated the evolution of human sleep architecture, focusing on: total sleep duration, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep duration, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep duration, and proportion of sleep in REM.

Materials and Methods
We used two different Bayesian methods: phylogenetic prediction based on phylogenetic generalized least squares and a multistate Onrstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) evolutionary model of random drift and stabilizing selection.

Results
Phylogenetic prediction confirmed that humans sleep less than predicted for a primate of our body mass, predation risk, brain size, foraging needs, sexual selection, and diet. These analyses further revealed that humans pack an unexpectedly higher proportion of REM sleep within a shorter overall sleep duration, and do so by reducing NREM sleep (rather than increasing REM). The OU model generally confirmed these findings, with shifts along the human lineage inferred for TST, NREM, and proportion of REM, but not for REM.

Discussion
We propose that the risks and opportunity costs of sleep are responsible for shorter sleep durations in humans, with risks arising from terrestrial sleep involving threats from predators and conspecifics, and opportunity costs because time spent sleeping could be used for learning, creating material objects, and socializing.},

Sleep is essential to cognitive function and health in humans, yet the ultimate reasons for sleep—i.e. ‘why’ sleep evolved—remain mysterious. We integrate findings from human sleep studies, the ethnographic record, and the ecology and evolution of mammalian sleep to better understand sleep along the human lineage and in the modern world. Compared to other primates, sleep in great apes has undergone substantial evolutionary change, with all great apes building a sleeping platform or ‘nest’. Further evolutionary change characterizes human sleep, with humans having the shortest sleep duration, yet the highest proportion of rapid eye movement sleep among primates. These changes likely reflect that our ancestors experienced fitness benefits from being active for a greater portion of the 24-h cycle than other primates, potentially related to advantages arising from learning, socializing and defending against predators and hostile conspecifics. Perspectives from evolutionary medicine have implications for understanding sleep disorders; we consider these perspectives in the context of insomnia, narcolepsy, seasonal affective disorder, circadian rhythm disorders and sleep apnea. We also identify how human sleep today differs from sleep through most of human evolution, and the implications of these changes for global health and health disparities. More generally, our review highlights the importance of phylogenetic comparisons in understanding human health, including well-known links between sleep, cognitive performance and health in humans.

the nailbed and pad, respectively were: nadir, 9%, 21%; onset, 18%, 19%; apex, 12%,
17%; apex time, 23%, 24%; mean 10%, 15%. For blood flow these values were: nadir
52%, 64%; onset, 6%, 5%; apex, 33%, 31%; apex time 9%, 8%; and mean 43%, 34%.
Greater variability was found in the temperature response of the finger pad than the
nailbed, but for blood flow the variability was similar between locations. Variability in
onset and apex time between sites was similar for both temperature and blood flow
responses. The reproducibility of the timecourse of CIVD suggests this methodology
may be of value for further studies examining the mechanism of the response.

Reflecting this is the rise of the flipped or inverted classroom. The purpose of this scoping review was to provide a comprehensive overview of relevant research regarding the emergence of the flipped classroom and the links to pedagogy and educational outcomes, identifying any gaps in the literature which could inform future design and evaluation. The scoping review is underpinned by the five-stage framework Arksey and O'Malley. The results indicate that there is much indirect evidence emerging of improved academic performance and student and staff satisfaction with the flipped approach but a paucity of conclusive evidence that it contributes to building lifelong learning and other 21st Century skills in under-graduate education and post-graduate education. },

Over the past century, the trade in amphibian species has accelerated, and now all lineages of B. dendrobatidis occur in traded amphibians; the fungus has become ubiquitous and is diversifying rapidly.Science, this issue p. 621; see also p. 604Globalized infectious diseases are causing species declines worldwide, but their source often remains elusive. We used whole-genome sequencing to solve the spatiotemporal origins of the most devastating panzootic to date, caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, a proximate driver of global amphibian declines. We traced the source of B. dendrobatidis to the Korean peninsula, where one lineage, BdASIA-1, exhibits the genetic hallmarks of an ancestral population that seeded the panzootic. We date the emergence of this pathogen to the early 20th century, coinciding with the global expansion of commercial trade in amphibians, and we show that intercontinental transmission is ongoing. Our findings point to East Asia as a geographic hotspot for B. dendrobatidis biodiversity and the original source of these lineages that now parasitize amphibians worldwide.},

A weight loss of 1 kg, presumably water, was made good within 1 week of return to the south. A fat loss of some 3.9 kg was probably attributable largely to the demands of lean tissue synthesis. The lean mass was increased by 3.9 kg over the trial, with parallel gains of muscle force and aerobic power. The rapid mobilization of depot fat led to marked ketonuria.},

  abstract      = {From the rapidly growing literature on bullying, it is increasingly recognised that peer relationship problems as manifested in being bullied are associated with low self-esteem. However, the literature on self-esteem in relation to children who bully others is controversial. The objective of this paper is to elucidate further our understanding of the relationship between self-concept and bullying behaviour. Data from a nationwide study of bullying behaviour carried out in Ireland during 1993-1994 have been reviewed. The relevant results from 8,249 school children aged 8 to 18 years are presented. The paper examines the global and dimensional nature of self-esteem and how it relates to children and adolescents who either have been victimised or bullied others. A distinction is made between pure victims, pure bullies, and children and adolescents who were both bullied and who bullied others. In other words, pure victims were those who had not bullied others, and pure bullies had not themselves been bullied. Those who were both bullied and bullied others were subdivided further into victims who bully occasionally, sometimes, and frequently and bullies who are victimised, occasionally, sometimes, and frequently. The results show that children of both primary and post-primary age who were involved in bullying as victims, bullies, or both had significantly lower global self-esteem than did children who had neither bullied nor been bullied. However, the pure bullies, in contrast to the pure victims, placed the same value on their physical attractiveness and attributes and on their popularity as did their peers who had not bullied others or been bullied. The bully-victims of all ages had the lowest self-esteem of the subgroups in the study. Also, the more frequently children were victimised or bullied others, the lower was their global self-esteem. The typology and frequency of bullying and the age of the children when they were involved in bullying influenced the status of the specific domains of self-esteem. There were, e.g., significant differences in anxiety between the pure bullies of post-primary age and their peers who had not bullied others or been bullied. The post-primary children who bullied most frequently were the least anxious. The results indicate that high self-esteem protects children and adolescents from involvement in bullying. Thus, in view of the strong relationship between self-esteem and bullying that has been found in the present paper, it is recommended that top priority be given by parents and teachers to preventing and reducing feelings of poor self-worth among children and adolescents.

  abstract      = {Lactation appears to be an ancient reproductive trait that predates the origin of mammals. The synapsid branch of the amniote tree that separated from other taxa in the Pennsylvanian (>310 million years ago) evolved a glandular rather than scaled integument. Repeated radiations of synapsids produced a gradual accrual of mammalian features. The mammary gland apparently derives from an ancestral apocrine-like gland that was associated with hair follicles. This association is retained by monotreme mammary glands and is evident as vestigial mammary hair during early ontogenetic development of marsupials. The dense cluster of mammo-pilo-sebaceous units that open onto a nipple-less mammary patch in monotremes may reflect a structure that evolved to provide moisture and other constituents to permeable eggs. Mammary patch secretions were coopted to provide nutrients to hatchlings, but some constituents including lactose may have been secreted by ancestral apocrine-like glands in early synapsids. Advanced Triassic therapsids, such as cynodonts, almost certainly secreted complex, nutrient-rich milk, allowing a progressive decline in egg size and an increasingly altricial state of the young at hatching. This is indicated by the very small body size, presence of epipubic bones, and limited tooth replacement in advanced cynodonts and early mammaliaforms. Nipples that arose from the mammary patch rendered mammary hairs obsolete, while placental structures have allowed lactation to be truncated in living eutherians.},

The study investigated the responses of 120 male primary school students aged 10-13 years from five schools. The children read a story about a popular in-group and an unpopular out-group which involved the manipulation of three variables: the norms of the in-group (bullying vs. fairness); distinctiveness threat (out-group similarity vs. out-group difference); and the behaviour of the in-group character towards the out-group character (bullying vs. helpful). It was predicted that a perceived threat to group distinctiveness, represented by similarity between the in-group and the out-group, and salient group norms that prescribed either bullying or fairness, would moderate the acceptability of bullying behaviours. Two story response measures were analysed: in-group character liking and whether the in-group character would be retained as a group member following his behaviour. The strongest support for social identity theory was revealed in the retention of in-group character variable. The in-group character was much more likely to have been retained as a group member when he behaved in accordance with group norms. Evidence was also found that bullying was more acceptable when directed at an out-group member who was similar and therefore possibly represented a threat to the in-group.

  abstract      = {Abstract. In association with the international validation project to establish an OECD Enhanced Test Guideline 407, we performed a 28-day repeated-dose toxicity study of genistein, which is known as a phytoestrogen. Attention was paid to the sensitivity of certain additional parameters, such as histopathology observations and organ weights of endocrine related organs, sperm characteristics, serum hormone levels and estrous cycle, for detecting endocrine-related effects of endocrine-disrupting chemicals based on the existing TG 407. Seven-week-old Crj:CD(SD)IGS rats were assigned to one of four groups, each consisting of ten males and ten females, and genistein was administered once daily by gavage at doses of 0 (control), 120, 400 or 1000 mg/kg body weight per day. Male rats were killed on the day after the 28th administration. Female rats were killed on the day of the diestrus stage during the 4 days after the 28th administration. Endocrine-disrupting effects of genistein were detected in females by histopathology. The changes included vacuolation and mucinification of the vaginal epithelium in the 400 and 1000 mg/kg groups; however, the incidences of the lesion were very low. Although increased serum prolactin levels were recorded in the males of the 1000 mg/kg group, we could not determine whether this was indeed induced by genistein. General toxicological effects of genistein were detected in blood chemistry, such as increased triglycerides and total protein and a decreased albumin/globulin ratio, as well as increased liver weight and glycogen deposition in the periportal hepatocytes. Based on these results, the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) in the present study was estimated to be 120 mg/kg per day. In particular, endocrine-related effects were most sensitively detected by histopathology examination of sexual organs. However, the findings indicate that chemicals with weak endocrine-disrupting potential like genistein must be evaluated taking into consideration the results of other test systems. },

  abstract      = {Some birds achieve primate-like levels of cognition, even though their brains tend to be much smaller in absolute size. This poses a fundamental problem in comparative and computational neuroscience, because small brains are expected to have a lower information-processing capacity. Using the isotropic fractionator to determine numbers of neurons in specific brain regions, here we show that the brains of parrots and songbirds contain on average twice as many neurons as primate brains of the same mass, indicating that avian brains have higher neuron packing densities than mammalian brains. Additionally, corvids and parrots have much higher proportions of brain neurons located in the pallial telencephalon compared with primates or other mammals and birds. Thus, large-brained parrots and corvids have forebrain neuron counts equal to or greater than primates with much larger brains. We suggest that the large numbers of neurons concentrated in high densities in the telencephalon substantially contribute to the neural basis of avian intelligence.},

  abstract      = {We review postcopulatory phenomena in the Swedish sand lizard (Lacerta agilis) and adder (Vipera berus), and in particular, links between female promiscuity, determinants of paternity, and offspring viability. In both species, females mate multiply and exhibit a positive relationship between the number of partners and off-spring viability. We conclude that this relationship is most likely the result of variable genetic compatibility between mates arising from postcopulatory phenomena, predominantly assortative fertilization with respect to parental genotypes. However, males who were more successful at mate acquisition were also more successful in situations of sperm competition, suggesting a possible link between male (diploid and haploid) genetic quality per se and probability of fertilization. Neither the number of partners nor the number of matings influenced the risk of infertility in sand lizards, suggesting that selection for reduced risk of infertility is not a sufficient explanation for maintaining female promiscuity in this population. Finally, we conclude that the relatively low genetic variability exhibited by our study populations may have facilitated detection of genetic benefits compared to more outbred ones. However, recent work derived from outbred populations in other taxa suggest a greater generality of the principles we discuss than previously may have been appreciated.},

  abstract      = {Genitalia are morphologically variable across many taxa and in physical contact during intromission, but little is known about how variation in form correlates with function during copulation. Marine mammals offer important insights into the evolutionary forces that act on genital morphology because they have diverse genitalia and are adapted to aquatic living and mating. Cetaceans have a fibroelastic penis and muscular vaginal folds, while pinnipeds have a baculum and lack vaginal folds. We examined copulatory fit in naturally deceased marine mammals to identify anatomical landmarks in contact during copulation and the potential depth of penile penetration into the vagina. Excised penises were artificially inflated to erection with pressurized saline and compared with silicone vaginal endocasts and within excised vaginas in simulated copulation using high-resolution, diffusible iodine-based, contrast-enhanced computed tomography. We found evidence suggestive of both congruent and antagonistic genital coevolution, depending on the species. We suggest that sexual selection influences morphological shape. This study improves our understanding of how mechanical interactions during copulation influence the shape of genitalia and affect fertility, and has broad applications to other taxa and species conservation.},

We assessed the determinants of Lyme-disease risk (density and Borrelia burgdorferi-infection prevalence of nymphal Ixodes scapularis ticks) over 13 y on several field plots within eastern deciduous forests in the epicenter of US Lyme disease (Dutchess County, New York). We used a model comparison approach to simultaneously test the importance of ambient growing-season temperature, precipitation, two indices of deer (Odocoileus virginianus) abundance, and densities of white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus), eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus), and acorns (Quercus spp.), in both simple and multiple regression models, in predicting entomological risk. Indices of deer abundance had no predictive power, and precipitation in the current year and temperature in the prior year had only weak effects on entomological risk. The strongest predictors of a current year's risk were the prior year's abundance of mice and chipmunks and abundance of acorns 2 y previously. In no case did inclusion of deer or climate variables improve the predictive power of models based on rodents, acorns, or both. We conclude that interannual variation in entomological risk of exposure to Lyme disease is correlated positively with prior abundance of key hosts for the immature stages of the tick vector and with critical food resources for those hosts.},

The aggregative nature of multicellular development makes the cells vulnerable to exploitation by cheaters, and the potential for cheating is indeed high. Cells might avoid being victimized if they can discriminate among individuals and avoid those that are genetically different. We tested how widely social amoebae cooperate by mixing isolates from different localities that cover most of their natural range. We show here that different isolates partially exclude one another during aggregation, and there is a positive relationship between the extent of this exclusion and the genetic distance between strains. Our findings demonstrate that D. discoideum cells co-aggregate more with genetically similar than dissimilar individuals, suggesting the existence of a mechanism that discerns the degree of genetic similarity between individuals in this social microorganism.},

Performance was measured at baseline and again 60 min and 90 min after each treatment (separated by a 7-day washout). Caffeine improved subjective alertness at 60 min and accuracy on the attention-switching task at 90 min. The L-theanine and caffeine combination improved both speed and accuracy of performance of the attention-switching task at 60 min, and reduced susceptibility to distracting information in the memory task at both 60 min and 90 min. These results replicate previous evidence which suggests that L-theanine and caffeine in combination are beneficial for improving performance on cognitively demanding tasks.},

  abstract      = {Most of the ocean is dark. Yet it is in this darkness, away from photosynthesizing sunlight, that most planetary carbon cycling occurs. Pachiadaki et al. show that nitrite-oxidizing bacteria in one phylum are the predominant fixers of dissolved inorganic carbon in the mesopelagic ocean. The authors sequenced thousands of single amplified genomes of marine prokaryotes. They identified more than 30 nitrite-oxidizing obligate chemoautotrophic bacteria that were unable to transport carbohydrate and that expressed nitrite oxidoreductase. This enzyme provides electrons to drive a reverse tricarboxylic acid cycle that fixes the carbon. Many of the genomes also suggest organisms that have the capacity to produce ammonium and other substrates, possibly to feed nitrite-producing metabolic partners.Science, this issue p. 1046Carbon fixation by chemoautotrophic microorganisms in the dark ocean has a major impact on global carbon cycling and ecological relationships in the ocean{\textquoteright}s interior, but the relevant taxa and energy sources remain enigmatic. We show evidence that nitrite-oxidizing bacteria affiliated with the Nitrospinae phylum are important in dark ocean chemoautotrophy. Single-cell genomics and community metagenomics revealed that Nitrospinae are the most abundant and globally distributed nitrite-oxidizing bacteria in the ocean. Metaproteomics and metatranscriptomics analyses suggest that nitrite oxidation is the main pathway of energy production in Nitrospinae. Microautoradiography, linked with catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization, indicated that Nitrospinae fix 15 to 45\% of inorganic carbon in the mesopelagic western North Atlantic. Nitrite oxidation may have a greater impact on the carbon cycle than previously assumed.},

  abstract      = {Gender differences were explored in experiences of social and physical aggression of adolescents (39 boys and 37 girls; mean age 13.8). They reported the frequency of experiencing physical aggression and social aggression, described in detail past incidents of peer victimization, and completed the Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents. The most common social aggression reported was being gossiped about, and the majority of adolescents reported that the aggressor was of the same gender. Although both genders reported equal frequencies of social aggression, girls thought about it more and were more distressed by it than were boys. Frequency of social aggression was more strongly related to girls' self-concepts than to boys'. This research provides evidence that young adolescents, and especially victimized girls, are hurt by social aggression. When children and adolescents want to express anger and contempt toward peers, they sometimes aggress physically but also hurt others by friendship manipulation, social exclusion, and negative gossip or back-stabbing (Crick, Bigbee, & Howes, 1996). These behaviors have been termed social or relational aggression, and the purpose of such behaviors is to harm others by damaging their self-esteem, social status, or close relationships (Galen & Underwood, 1997). This investigation explored how being the victim of social and physical aggression affects a normal sample of young adolescent girls and boys. Rather than identifying a subsample of youth who frequently experience victimization, a normal sample of young adolescents was asked to tell us about single experiences when they were the targets of social and physical aggression. We elicited detailed, narrative accounts of past experiences of social and physical aggression to explore gender differences in emotional and behavioral responses to both types of peer victimization. Correlations also were examined between frequency of being the victim of each type of aggression and adolescents' self-concepts in specific domains. Previous research has clearly established that girls use socially manipulative means of aggression toward their same-gender peers more frequently than do boys (Bjorkqvist, 1994; Crick & Grotpeter, 1995). What are the short- and long-term effects of being the victim of social aggression, and how do these compare to the effects of physical aggression? The little existing research on social aggression demonstrates that children, particularly girls, view socially manipulative acts as hurtful (Crick et al., 1996; Galen & Underwood, 1997). Being the victim of social aggression could be detrimental to self-esteem in that this constant threat to social status may result in poor self-perceptions of academic competence, physical appearance, and the potential to have close friendships. In addition, if adolescents' social relationships are frequently manipulated, they may eventually have difficulty trusting others, which could inhibit their ability to have healthy social and romantic relationships in the future. In order to consider carefully the effect of victimization by social and physical aggression, it is important to understand exactly how these forms of aggression are defined. Although there are hundreds of existing definitions of aggression, most share two common features: The aggressive act must be perceived as harmful...},

Methods Twenty-five older adults were randomly assigned to a reactive balance training group (QuickBoard; nÂ =Â 12; 71.0Â Â±Â 8.6 years) or a stationary cycling group (control; nÂ =Â 13; 70.2Â Â±Â 6.0 years). Both groups were tested for foot \{RT\} foot speed, static balance, and balance confidence at baseline, 4-week, 8-week, and 4-week follow-up. Results Results indicated significant improvements in QuickBoard foot \{RT\} and speed in both groups with greater improvements in the QuickBoard group. However, no group difference was found in static balance performance. Conclusion Although the improvements in \{RT\} and foot speed may be beneficial for fall and trip prevention, the implications of the current findings for trip avoidance and performance of daily tasks are unclear. },

These similarities form the basis for the proposal that multicellularity is ancestral to the clade containing animals, fungi, and Amoebozoa (including Dictyostelium): Amorphea (formerly âunikontsâ). This hypothesis is intriguing and if true could precipitate a paradigm shift. However, phylogenetic analyses of two key genes reveal patterns inconsistent with a single origin of multicellularity. A single origin in Amorphea would also require loss of multicellularity in each of the many unicellular lineages within this clade. Further, there are numerous other origins of multicellularity within eukaryotes, including three within Amorphea, that are not characterized by these structural and mechanistic similarities. Instead, convergent evolution resulting from similar selective pressures for forming multicellular structures with motile and differentiated cells is the most likely explanation for the observed similarities between animal and dictyostelid cell-cell connections.},

  abstract      = {Chocolate consumption has long been associated with enjoyment and pleasure. Popular claims confer on chocolate the properties of being a stimulant, relaxant, euphoriant, aphrodisiac, tonic and antidepressant. The last claim stimulated this review.

Method
We review chocolate's properties and the principal hypotheses addressing its claimed mood altering propensities. We distinguish between food craving and emotional eating, consider their psycho-physiological underpinnings, and examine the likely ‘positioning’ of any effect of chocolate to each concept.

Results
Chocolate can provide its own hedonistic reward by satisfying cravings but, when consumed as a comfort eating or emotional eating strategy, is more likely to be associated with prolongation rather than cessation of a dysphoric mood.

Limitations
This review focuses primarily on clarifying the possibility that, for some people, chocolate consumption may act as an antidepressant self-medication strategy and the processes by which this may occur.

Conclusions
Any mood benefits of chocolate consumption are ephemeral.},

  abstract      = {It is often supposed that a protein's rate of evolution and its amino acid content are determined by the function and anatomy of the protein. Here we examine an alternative possibility, namely that the requirement to specify in the unprocessed RNA, in the vicinity of intronexon boundaries, information necessary for removal of introns (e.g., exonic splice enhancers) affects both amino acid usage and rates of protein evolution. We find that the majority of amino acids show skewed usage near intronexon boundaries, and that differences in the trends for the 2-fold and 4-fold blocks of both arginine and leucine show this to be owing to effects mediated at the nucleotide level. More specifically, there is a robust relationship between the extent to which an amino acid is preferred/avoided near boundaries and its enrichment/paucity in splice enhancers. As might then be expected, the rate of evolution is lowest near intronexon boundaries, at least in part owing to splice enhancers, such that domains flanking intronexon junctions evolve on average at under half the rate of exon centres from the same gene. In contrast, the rate of evolution of intronless retrogenes is highest near the domains where intronexon junctions previously resided. The proportion of sequence near intronexon boundaries is one of the stronger predictors of a protein's rate of evolution in mammals yet described. We conclude that after intron insertion selection favours modification of amino acid content near intronexon junctions, so as to enable efficient intron removal, these changes then being subject to strong purifying selection even if nonoptimal for protein function. Thus there exists a strong force operating on protein evolution in mammals that is not explained directly in terms of the biology of the protein.},

Lungs, brain developed normally during four-week trial

WOMB WITH A VIEW A lamb at 107 days of gestation (left) — equivalent to about a human fetus at 23 to 24 weeks gestation — matured normally in an artificial womb. Right is the same lamb 28 days later. Such devices may one day help premature babies survive outside the bodies of their mothers.

Premature babies may one day continue developing in an artificial womb, new work with sheep suggests.

A fluid-filled bag that mimics the womb kept premature lambs alive and developing normally for four weeks, researchers report April 25 in Nature Communications. Lambs at a gestational age equivalent to that of a 23- or 24-week-old human fetus had normal lung and brain development after a month in the artificial womb, the researchers discovered. A similar device might be ready for use in premature human babies in three to five years if additional animal tests pan out, study coauthor Alan Flake estimates.

But this is not the science fiction scenario of Brave New World, in which humans were grown entirely in tanks, says Flake, a pediatric and fetal surgeon at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “I don’t view this as something that’s going to replace mothers.” Technical and biological hurdles would prevent doctors from using an artificial womb to rescue premature babies younger than about 23 weeks, he says.

Researchers have been trying for 60 years to make an artificial womb or artificial placenta, says George Mychaliska, a pediatric and fetal surgeon at the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor. His own group has been working on an artificial placenta, or what he calls an “extra-corporeal life-support” system for premature babies for a decade. “One month is very impressive, and the data behind that is strong,” Mychaliska says, but adds that what works for lambs might not work as well for human babies.

In the United States, thousands of babies each year are born extremely premature, before 28 weeks of pregnancy. Of those born at the edge of viability, at 23 weeks of gestation, up to about 70 percent die; many of the survivors have lung and other health problems partly caused by efforts to keep them alive. Putting premature babies on ventilators to get oxygen into their bodies has mixed results, Mychaliska says. “The same treatment that is potentially saving their lives is also damaging their lungs.”

Flake and colleagues’ initial efforts to make an artificial womb — including submerging lambs in fluid in a tank — failed. Infection soon set in, killing the animals. This time, the researchers tried to mimic more closely what happens during normal pregnancy. In the new system, a lamb is surgically delivered via cesarean section and placed in a sterile bag filled with an electrolyte fluid. Because the bag is closed, the risk of infection is reduced. Tubes carrying oxygenated blood plug into the lamb’s umbilical cord, and the beating of the fetus’s heart pumps the blood at volumes and pressure comparable to what is normally delivered by the placenta. Other groups have put tubes in the neck and used an external pump to circulate the blood, which may put too much pressure on fetal hearts, causing heart failure, Flake says.

Like a real womb, the artificial one also bathes lambs in the fluid needed for proper lung development. Flake’s team prevents the lambs from taking a breath because even a little air might harm lung development.

Premature babies would have to be delivered surgically and placed immediately into the fluid incubator. That would rule out about 50 percent of extremely premature babies because they are born vaginally, Flake says.

Flake’s version of the device may not be feasible for human babies for several technical reasons, too, Mychaliska says. One barrier is that the system requires a delicate fetal surgery to connect the umbilical cord to the incubator while the baby is still attached to the mother. Few hospitals are equipped to perform such an operation, he says. 

Flake acknowledges that several kinks must still be worked out before the artificial womb can be tested on human babies. “We have a lot to learn in terms of its capabilities and its safety,” he says, but his group may soon be ready to begin human clinical trials. “We honestly think it could be as early as two to three years from now — and certainly within five years — that we’ll be applying it to humans.”

The theory has been supported by correlational evidence and conceptual analogies to economics. A simulated evolution experiment was performed to provide a clearer test of whether female reproductive refractoriness alone can drive the emergence of differences in mating selectivity. A population of male and female replicators initially differed only in that females were unavailable to mate for a fixed period prior to the appearance of offspring. Over succeeding generations, females evolved far greater selectivity than males with respect to the longevity of potential mates. This greater selectivity was relatively robust with respect to population and genetic parameters, but quantitatively unstable with realistic breeding population sizes.},

Pelagic animals were victimized more than benthic animals during previous mass extinctions but are not preferentially threatened in the modern ocean. The differential importance of large-bodied animals to ecosystem function portends greater future ecological disruption than that caused by similar levels of taxonomic loss in past mass extinction events.},

We present a model in which phenotypic plasticity of a resident species increases its ability to oppose invaders, and plasticity of an invader increases its ability to displace residents. Whereas these effects are expected due to increased fitness associated with phenotypic plasticity, the model additionally reveals a new and unforeseen mechanism by which plasticity affects invasions: phenotypic plasticity increases the steepness of the fitness surface, thereby making invasion more difficult, even by phenotypically plastic invaders. Our results should apply to phenotypically plastic responses to any fluctuating environmental factors including predation risk, and to other factors that affect the fitness surface such as the generalism of predators. We extend the results to competition, and argue that phenotypic plasticity's effect on the fitness surface will destabilize coexistence at local scales, but stabilize coexistence at regional scales. Our study emphasizes the need to incorporate variable interaction strengths due to phenotypic plasticity into invasion biology and ecological theory on competition and coexistence in fragmented landscapes.},

The results highlight the contextual nature of how feedback is

education, and Batten et al. 2013, who explore the impact of
student reputation on assessment. These and many other studies
conclude that anonymous assessment resulted in no apparent
changes in assessment outcomes. In this paper we explore the
implications of anonymity taking examples from educational
settings where student anonymity is already an adopted practice.
We discuss the positive and negative implications of student
anonymity, and identify areas for future research.},

A significant proportion of the energy is released through thermogenesis by mitochondria. This is due to a less than perfect coupling of cellular respiration to ATP synthesis. Previous studies of brown adipocytes, which are cells specialized in regulatory thermogenesis, have shown that heat production is due to the regulated activity and synthesis of a particular proton transporter in the inner membrane of brown adipocyte mitochondria -- uncoupling protein (UCP) 1. UCP homologues have recently been identified. UCP2 is widely expressed in human tissues, whereas UCP3 is expressed predominantly in human skeletal muscles. These novel UCPs represent genes which are potentially important for regulation of metabolic pathways and energy expenditure in humans. Biochemical and genetic studies support a role for these novel UCPs in metabolic regulations in humans. However, several physiological studies question such a role. Importantly, UCP2 and UCP3 seem to be able to control the activity of mitochondria in response to oxidants.},

  abstract      = {Bullying and victimization were studied from a longitudinal, multi-method, multi-agent perspective as youngsters made the transition from primary through middle school. Generally, bullying and aggression increased with the transition to middle school and then declined. Bullying mediated youngsters" dominance status during the transition. Bullying may be one way in which young adolescents manage peer and dominance relationships as they make the transition into new social groups. Victimization declined from primary to secondary school. Correspondingly, youngsters" peer affiliations decreased, initially with the transition, and then recovered. Victimization, however, was buffered by peer affiliation, especially like most nominations relative to friendship nominations, during this time. Additionally, and consistent with the idea that bullying is used for dominance displays, cross-sex comparisons of aggressive bouts indicated that boys targeted other boys and did not target girls. Results are discussed in terms of the changing functions of aggression during adolescence.},

These analyses showed that concentrations of various hormones, electrolytes, free fatty acids, triglycerides, lactate, ketone bodies, cortisol, and glucose were not significantly correlated with reported alcohol hangover severity. Also, markers of dehydration (e.g., vasopressin) were not significantly related to hangover severity. Some studies report a significant correlation between blood acetaldehyde concentration and hangover severity, but most convincing is the significant relationship between immune factors and hangover severity. The latter is supported by studies showing that hangover severity may be reduced by inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis. Several factors do not cause alcohol hangover but can aggravate its severity. These include sleep deprivation, smoking, congeners, health status, genetics and individual differences. Future studies should more rigorously study these factors as well as biological correlates to further elucidate the pathology of alcohol hangover.},

Objective—To gain insight into the function of proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) in humans by establishing whether circulating levels are influenced by diurnal, dietary, and hormonal changes.

Methods and Results—We monitored circulating PCSK9 in a set of dynamic human experiments and could show that serum PCSK9 levels display a diurnal rhythm that closely parallels that of cholesterol synthesis, measured as serum lathosterol. In contrast to these marked diurnal changes in cholesterol metabolism, serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels remained stable during the diurnal cycle. Depletion of liver cholesterol by treatment with the bile acid–binding resin, cholestyramine, abolished the diurnal rhythms of both PCSK9 and lathosterol. Fasting (>18 hours) strongly reduced circulating PCSK9 and lathosterol levels, whereas serum LDL levels remained unchanged. Growth hormone, known to be increased during fasting in humans, reduced circulating PCSK9 in parallel to LDL cholesterol levels.

Conclusion—Throughout the day, and in response to fasting and cholesterol depletion, circulating PCSK9 displays marked variation, presumably related to oscillations in hepatic cholesterol that modify its activity in parallel with cholesterol synthesis. In addition to this sterol-mediated regulation, additional effects on LDL receptors may be mediated by hormones directly influencing PCSK9.

  abstract      = {Despite much current debate regarding central and peripheral
neural mechanisms which may be responsible for the onset of
fatigue during prolonged exercise, maintenance of nutritional
and hydration status remains critical for successful participation
in ultra-endurance exercise. This review focuses on substrate
and fluid homeostasis during ultra-endurance exercise and the
use of nutritional supplementation both as ergogenic aid and to
attenuate exercise-induced immunosuppression.
Recent findings
Current evidence continues to support mandatory high
carbohydrate intakes (1) before the event to maximize muscle
glycogen stores, (2) during the event to prevent hypoglycaemia
and (3) after the event to optimize post-event repletion of
endogenous carbohydrate stores. No consistent performance
benefit has yet been shown following a high-fat diet. Greater
utilization of intrafascicular triglyceride stores appears to
account for additional fat utilization in females. Recent trends
towards excessive fluid intake have resulted in frequent reports
of hyponatraemic hyperhydration in ultra-distance athletes, with
greater incidence in women than in men. Carbohydrate
supplementation during the event attenuates
immunosuppressive hormonal and cytokine responses to ultraendurance
exercise, but may impair vitamin C absorption, while
the ergogenic value of caffeine supplementation in ultraendurance
performance is currently being questioned.
Summary
Meeting macronutrient and fluid intake demands remains an
important priority for ultra-endurance athletes. Yet these athletes
are reported to present with a high incidence of disordered
eating patterns during periods of training, and excessive fluid
replacement strategies have resulted in an increased incidence
of water intoxication with resultant central nervous system
dysfunction.

A formula diet providing 1.5 g protein and 0.5 g carbohydrate (CHO) per kilogram of ideal body weight daily (mean intake 720 kcal/d) was given to 12 overweight inpatients for 4 to 5 weeks. Six subjects remained sedentary (group 1), while the other six subjects (group 2) performed supervised endurance exercise (a total of 27 hours at 50% of maximal oxygen uptake (VÌO2max) over 4 weeks). Lean tissue preservation was excellent in both groups and was unaffected by the group 2 exercise regimen. Weight loss over 4 weeks in the two groups did not differ (group 1, 6.9 Â± 0.7 kg; group 2, 6.5 Â± 0.7 kg). The VÌO2max was not increased after 4 weeks of exercise compared with controls. The resting oxygen consumption (rVÌO2) of both groups declined 10% (P &lt; .001) in the first seven days of dieting. Thereafter the rVÌO2 in group 1 remained stable, but a further 17% reduction occurred in group 2 (P &lt; .03) by the third week of exercise. The free triiodothyronine (fT3) concentration also fell more in group 2 (P &lt; .05), suggesting a relationship between fT3 and energy expenditure during severe caloric restriction. The ergometer exercise for up to two hours daily was well tolerated. The absence of either a training effect or accelerated weight loss in group 2 may be due to the limited duration (4 weeks) or intensity of the exercise. The significant reduction in rVÌO2 as a measure of \{REE\} is both surprising and difficult to explain. The lack of objective benefits from aggressive aerobic exercise concurrent with a severely restricted diet suggests that these therapeutic modalities be employed sequentially, rather than simultaneously, in the multidisciplinary approach to obesity. },

  abstract      = {Evolutionary biologists often use phenotypic differences between species and between individuals to gain an understanding of organismal design. The focus of much recent attention has been on developmental plasticity – the environmentally induced variability during development within a single genotype. The phenotypic variation expressed by single reproductively mature organisms throughout their life, traditionally the subject of many physiological studies, has remained underexploited in evolutionary biology. Phenotypic flexibility, the reversible within-individual variation, is a function of environmental conditions varying predictably (e.g. with season), or of more stochastic fluctuations in the environment. Here, we provide a common framework to bring the different categories of phenotypic plasticity together, and emphasize perspectives on adaptation that reversible types of plasticity might provide. We argue that better recognition and use of the various levels of phenotypic variation will increase the scope for phenotypic experimentation, comparison and integration.},

By means of a meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of MBCT for prevention of relapse or recurrence among patients with recurrent MDD in remission. Electronic databases were searched and researchers were contacted for further relevant studies. Studies were coded for quality. Meta-analyses were performed by means of the Cochrane Collaboration Review Manager 5.1. Six randomized controlled trials with a total of 593 participants were included in the meta-analysis. MBCT significantly reduced the risk of relapse/recurrence with a risk ratio of 0.66 for MBCT compared to treatment as usual or placebo controls, corresponding to a relative risk reduction of 34%. In a pre-planned subgroup analysis the relative risk reduction was 43% for participants with three or more previous episodes, while no risk reduction was found for participants with only two episodes. In two studies, MBCT was at least as effective as maintenance antidepressant medication. Results of this meta-analysis indicate that MBCT is an effective intervention for relapse prevention in patients with recurrent MDD in remission, at least in case of three or more previous MDD episodes.},

METHODS:: A group of five healthy adults were assessed during life in a Stone Age-like settlement over two months. RESULTS:: The most notable finding was that nocturnal time in bed and estimated sleep time, as measured by actigraphy, markedly increased during the experimental period compared to the periods prior to and following the experiment. These increases were primarily driven by a phase-advance shift of sleep onset. Subjective assessments of health and functioning did not reveal any relevant changes across the study. CONCLUSIONS:: Our observations provide further evidence for the long-held belief that the absence of modern living conditions is associated with an earlier sleep phase and prolonged sleep duration.

  abstract      = {Evolution based on the benefits of acquiring ?good genes? in sexual selection is only plausible with the reliable transmission of genetic quality from one generation to the next. Accumulating evidence suggests that sexually antagonistic (SA) genes with opposite effects on Darwinian fitness when expressed in the two different sexes may be common in animals and plants. These SA genes should weaken the potential indirect genetic benefits of sexual selection by reducing the fitness of opposite-sex progeny from high-fitness parents. Here we use hemiclonal analysis in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to directly measure the inheritance of fitness across generations, over the entire genome. We show that any potential genetic benefits of sexual selection in this system are not merely weakened, but completely reversed over one generation because high-fitness males produce low-fitness daughters and high-fitness mothers produce low-fitness sons. Moreover, male fitness was not inherited by sons, consistent with both theory and recent evidence connecting this form of SA variation with the X chromosome. This inheritance pattern may help to explain how genetic variation for fitness is sustained despite strong sexual selection, and why the ZW sex chromosome system found in birds and butterflies appears to foster the evolution of extreme secondary sexual characters in males.},

Solar radiation passes through the epicuticle, which exhibits a grating-like structure, and continues to pass through layers of the exo-endocuticle until it is absorbed by the pigment melanin in the brown-colored cuticle or xanthopterin in the yellow-colored cuticle. The correlation between digging activity and the ability of the cuticle to absorb part of the solar radiation implies that the Oriental hornet may harvest parts of the solar radiation. In this study, we explore this intriguing possibility by analyzing the biophysical properties of the cuticle. We use rigorous coupled wave analysis simulations to show that the cuticle surfaces are structured to reduced reflectance and act as diffraction gratings to trap light and increase the amount absorbed in the cuticle. A dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) was constructed in order to show the ability of xanthopterin to serve as a light-harvesting molecule.},

Data synthesis In healthy adults and in the elderly, spontaneous consumption of alcoholic beverages within 30Â g ethanol/d for men and 15Â g/d for women is to be considered acceptable and do not deserve intervention by the primary care physician or the health professional in charge. Patients with increased risk for specific diseases, for example, women with familiar history of breast cancer, or subjects with familiar history of early cardiovascular disease, orÂ cardiovascular patients should discuss with their physician their drinking habits. NoÂ abstainer should be advised to drink for health reasons. Alcohol use must be discouraged in specific physiological or personal situations or in selected age classes (children and adolescents, pregnant and lactating women and recovering alcoholics). Moreover, the possible interactions between alcohol and acute or chronic drug use must be discussed with the primary care physician. Conclusions The choice to consume alcohol should be based on individual considerations, taking into account the influence on health and diet, the risk of alcoholism and abuse, the effect on behaviour and other factors that may vary with age and lifestyle. Moderation in drinking and development of an associated lifestyle culture should be fostered. },

interest to several disciplines. We carried out an extensive study in young Italian
males to provide estimates of normal variations of penile dimensions.
Methods: The penile length in flaccid and stretched states and the penile circumference were
measured in a random group of 3,300 young men aged 17–19 years and free from endocrine
disorders and from congenital or acquired abnormalities of the penis. In a random sample of
325 subjects of the same set of people, penile length and circumference were also correlated
with weight and height. Statistical analysis was performed with the Sperman test, because our
data were not normally distributed as tested by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (pd0.01).
Results: The median values of penile dimensions recorded in the present study are flaccid
length 9.0 cm, flaccid circumference, at the middle of the shaft, 10.0 cm, and stretched length
12.5 cm. We also observed that the penile dimensions are highly correlated with height and
weight.
Conclusions: Since penile length and circumference correlate with anthropometric parameters
such as weight and height, we suggest to consider themselves as two bodily measures which
display a wide extent of normal variability along the general population.},

Genetic diversity was consistent with the introduction of a very small number of individuals followed by a demographic explosion of the cat population. Significant genetic structure among sites (Fst=0.06 ±0.005) and absence of isolation by distance could indicate that the initial phase of fast colonisation is now over. Estimates of individual relatedness indicated a significant kin structure. Overall data suggested that the cat population of the main island has probably reached carrying capacity.},

Studies of genetic polymorphisms for coffee metabolism were excluded.Results~The umbrella review identified 201 meta-analyses of observational research with 67 unique health outcomes and 17 meta-analyses of interventional research with nine unique outcomes. Coffee consumption was more often associated with benefit than harm for a range of health outcomes across exposures including high versus low, any versus none, and one extra cup a day. There was evidence of a non-linear association between consumption and some outcomes, with summary estimates indicating largest relative risk reduction at intakes of three to four cups a day versus none, including all cause mortality (relative risk 0.83, 95\% confidence interval 0.83 to 0.88), cardiovascular mortality (0.81, 0.72 to 0.90), and cardiovascular disease (0.85, 0.80 to 0.90). High versus low consumption was associated with an 18\% lower risk of incident cancer (0.82, 0.74 to 0.89). Consumption was also associated with a lower risk of several specific cancers and neurological, metabolic, and liver conditions. Harmful associations were largely nullified by adequate adjustment for smoking, except in pregnancy, where high versus low/no consumption was associated with low birth weight (odds ratio 1.31, 95\% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.67), preterm birth in the first (1.22, 1.00 to 1.49) and second (1.12, 1.02 to 1.22) trimester, and pregnancy loss (1.46, 1.06 to 1.99). There was also an association between coffee drinking and risk of fracture in women but not in men.Conclusion~Coffee consumption seems generally safe within usual levels of intake, with summary estimates indicating largest risk reduction for various health outcomes at three to four cups a day, and more likely to benefit health than harm. Robust randomised controlled trials are needed to understand whether the observed associations are causal. Importantly, outside of pregnancy, existing evidence suggests that coffee could be tested as an intervention without significant risk of causing harm. Women at increased risk of fracture should possibly be excluded.},

Although measures exist for assessing EDs, these measures have not been thoroughly reviewed in athletes. This study reviewed the validity and reliability evidence of the commonly used measures for assessing \{EDs\} in athlete populations aged 18â26 years. Methods Databases were searched for studies of regarding \{ED\} on male and/or female athletes. Inclusion criteria stated the study (a) assessed \{EDs\} in an athlete population 18â26 years of age and (b) investigated \{EDs\} using a psychometric measure found valid and/or reliable in a non-athlete population and/or athlete population. Results Fifty studies met the inclusion criteria. Seven and 22 articles, respectively, studied \{EDs\} behaviors in male and female athletes whereas 21 articles studied \{EDs\} in combined-gender samples. The five most commonly used measures were the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT), Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI), Bulimia Test-Revised (BULIT-R), Questionnaire for Eating Disorder Diagnosis (QEDD), and the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q). Conclusion Only seven studies calculated validity coefficients within the study whereas 47 cited the validity coefficient. Twenty-six calculated a reliability coefficient whereas 47 cited the reliability of the \{ED\} measures. Four studies found validity evidence for the EAT, EDI, BULIT-R, QEDD, and EDE-Q in an athlete population. Few studies reviewed calculated validity and reliability coefficients of \{ED\} measures. Cross-validation of these measures in athlete populations is clearly needed. },

To examine this hypothesis the authors tested sub-components of executive function during an intensive military survival exercise. Compared to a control group the survival course participants showed significant impairment in the incongruent condition of the Stroop task; the mean repetition gap and adjacent letter pair components of the random letter generation task; and the planning and action components of the Tower of London task. No impairment was found in dual-task performance nor in verbal fluency. The pattern of the data suggests that the maladaptive behaviour frequently observed in survival incidents may be explained by dysfunction in the supervisory system-contention scheduler interface.

  abstract      = {Without scientific proof but driven by experience and intuition barefoot training is commonly used by coaches and athletes for both injury prevention and performance enhancement (Pinnington 2001). Due to geographic and climatic circumstances not everywhere in the world it is practically possible to train barefoot, e.g. outdoors on grass, the whole year through. Therefore it can be hypothized that an especially designed training shoe with a multiple segmented outsole, mimicking barefoot movements and allowing barefoot-like exercises on hard sur- faces, could induce different mechanical stimuli on foot and shank muscles. A biopositive adaptation should be advantageous in terms of injury prevention or performance enhancement. The purpose of this study was to iden- tify an eventual training and adaptation effect in morphology and function on foot and lower leg muscles when wearing such a specifically designed training shoe.},

She carried 1.6 differences per ten thousand base pairs between the two copies of her genome, fewer than present-day humans, suggesting that Neandertal populations were of small size. Our analyses indicate that she was more closely related to the Neandertals that mixed with the ancestors of present-day humans living outside of sub-Saharan Africa than the previously sequenced Neandertal from Siberia, allowing 10-20\% more Neandertal DNA to be identified in present-day humans, including variants involved in LDL cholesterol levels, schizophrenia and other diseases.},

  abstract      = {Birds have lost the potential for inter-specific hybridization slowly. This inference emerges from protein comparisons made on 36 pairs of bird species capable of hybridization. Micro-complement fixation tests show that hybridizable pairs of bird species differ by an average of 12 units of albumin immunological distance and 25 units of transferrin immunological distance. As these proteins evolve at a known and rather steady rate, it is inferred that the average hybridizable species pair diverged from a common ancestor about 22 million years ago. The corresponding period for frog species pairs capable of hybridization is about 21 million years, while for hybridizable placental mammals it is only 2 to 3 million years. Thus birds resemble frogs in having lost the potential for interspecific hybridization about 10 times as slowly as have mammals. Birds have also been evolving very slowly at the anatomical level, particularly within the last 25 million years, according to Simpson, Romer, and many other vertebrate zoologists. In this respect they resemble frogs and differ from placental mammals, which have been undergoing unusually rapid anatomical evolution. Chromosomal evolution is also thought to have proceeded very slowly in both birds and frogs, relative to mammals.The above observations are consistent with the hypothesis that evolutionary changes in regulatory systems, that is, changes in the patterns of gene expression, provide the basis for both anatomical evolution and the evolutionary loss of hybridization potential.

This is indicated by feats such as tool use, episodic-like memory, and the ability to use one's own experience in predicting the behavior of conspecifics. It is, however, not yet clear whether these skills are accompanied by an understanding of the self. In apes, self-directed behavior in response to a mirror has been taken as evidence of self-recognition. We investigated mirror-induced behavior in the magpie, a songbird species from the crow family. As in apes, some individuals behaved in front of the mirror as if they were testing behavioral contingencies. When provided with a mark, magpies showed spontaneous mark-directed behavior. Our findings provide the first evidence of mirror self-recognition in a non-mammalian species. They suggest that essential components of human self-recognition have evolved independently in different vertebrate classes with a separate evolutionary history.},

  abstract      = {Background: Sitting behaviours have been linked with increased risk of all-cause mortality independent of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Previous studies have tended to examine single indicators of sitting or all sitting behaviours combined. This study aims to enhance the evidence base by examining the type-specific prospective associations of four different sitting behaviours as well as total sitting with the risk of all-cause mortality.Methods: Participants (3720 men and 1412 women) from the Whitehall II cohort study who were free from cardiovascular disease provided information on weekly sitting time (at work, during leisure time, while watching TV, during leisure time excluding TV, and at work and during leisure time combined) and covariates in 1997–99. Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate prospective associations between sitting time (h/week) and mortality risk. Follow-up was from date of measurement until (the earliest of) death, date of censor or July 31 2014.Results: Over 81 373 person-years of follow-up (mean follow-up time 15.7 ± 2.2 years) a total of 450 deaths were recorded. No associations were observed between any of the five sitting indicators and mortality risk, either in unadjusted models or models adjusted for covariates including MVPA.Conclusions: Sitting time was not associated with all-cause mortality risk. The results of this study suggest that policy makers and clinicians should be cautious about placing emphasis on sitting behaviour as a risk factor for mortality that is distinct from the effect of physical activity.},

Group A and B (10 each) were drawn from tropical region of India, while Group C and D (6 each) from temperate zone of Russia and natives of Arctic, respectively. Initial study was conducted on control Group A at Delhi. Group B was airlifted to the Arctic (70 degrees N, 38 degrees E), where measurements were done on them during the seventh week of acclimatization, then they were flown back to Delhi and retested. For comparison, study was done at the Arctic on six migrants (Group C) from temperate zone of Russia and 6 natives (Group D) of the Arctic. There was a significant improvement of CIVD response and peripheral blood flow of tropical men due to acclimatization to Arctic environment, which was similar to that of the migrants but lower than the natives. Thus local cold acclimatization is possible even in tropical men as in those of the temperate zone people.},

  abstract      = {Summary Acute sleep deprivation can lead to judgement errors and thereby increases the risk of accidents, possibly due to an impaired working memory. However, whether the adverse effects of acute sleep loss on working memory are modulated by auditory distraction in women and men are not known. Additionally, it is unknown whether sleep loss alters the way in which men and women perceive their working memory performance. Thus, 24 young adults (12 women using oral contraceptives at the time of investigation) participated in two experimental conditions: nocturnal sleep (scheduled between 22:30 and 06:30Â hours) versus one night of total sleep loss. Participants were administered a digital working memory test in which eightâdigit sequences were learned and retrieved in the morning after each condition. Learning of digital sequences was accompanied by either silence or auditory distraction (equal distribution among trials). After sequence retrieval, each trial ended with a question regarding how certain participants were of the correctness of their response, as a selfâestimate of working memory performance. We found that sleep loss impaired objective but not selfâestimated working memory performance in women. In contrast, both measures remained unaffected by sleep loss in men. Auditory distraction impaired working memory performance, without modulation by sleep loss or sex. Being unaware of cognitive limitations when sleepâdeprived, as seen in our study, could lead to undesirable consequences in, for example, an occupational context. Our findings suggest that sleepâdeprived young women are at particular risk for overestimating their working memory performance.},

Here, we report that selection in the region with the second most extreme signal of positive selection in
Greenlandic Inuit favored a deeply divergent haplotype that is closely related to the sequence in the Denisovan
genome, and was likely introgressed from an archaic population. The region contains two genes, WARS2 and
TBX15, and has previously been associated with adipose tissue differentiation and body-fat distribution in humans.
We show that the adaptively introgressed allele has been under selection in a much larger geographic region than
just Greenland. Furthermore, it is associated with changes in expression of WARS2 and TBX15 in multiple tissues
including the adrenal gland and subcutaneous adipose tissue, and with regional DNA methylation changes in
TBX15.},

The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans also has a quiescent behavioural state during a period called lethargus, which occurs before each of the four moults4. Like sleep, lethargus maintains a constant temporal relationship with the expression of the C. elegans Period homologue LIN-42 (ref. 5). Here we show that quiescence associated with lethargus has the additional sleep-like properties of reversibility, reduced responsiveness and homeostasis. We identify the cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) gene egl-4 as a regulator of sleep-like behaviour, and show that egl-4 functions in sensory neurons to promote the C. elegans sleep-like state. Conserved effects on sleep-like behaviour of homologous genes in C. elegans and Drosophila suggest a common genetic regulation of sleep-like states in arthropods and nematodes. Our results indicate that C. elegans is a suitable model system for the study of sleep regulation. The association of this C. elegans sleep-like state with developmental changes that occur with larval moults suggests that sleep may have evolved to allow for developmental changes.},

  abstract      = {BACKGROUND. The idea that increasing salt intake increases drinking and urine volume is widely accepted. We tested the hypothesis that an increase in salt intake of 6 g/d would change fluid balance in men living under ultra-long-term controlled conditions.METHODS. Over the course of 2 separate space flight simulation studies of 105 and 205 daysâ duration, we exposed 10 healthy men to 3 salt intake levels (12, 9, or 6 g/d). All other nutrients were maintained constant. We studied the effect of salt-driven changes in mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid urinary excretion on day-to-day osmolyte and water balance.RESULTS. A 6-g/d increase in salt intake increased urine osmolyte excretion, but reduced free-water clearance, indicating endogenous free water accrual by urine concentration. The resulting endogenous water surplus reduced fluid intake at the 12-g/d salt intake level. Across all 3 levels of salt intake, half-weekly and weekly rhythmical mineralocorticoid release promoted free water reabsorption via the renal concentration mechanism. Mineralocorticoid-coupled increases in free water reabsorption were counterbalanced by rhythmical glucocorticoid release, with excretion of endogenous osmolyte and water surplus by relative urine dilution. A 6-g/d increase in salt intake decreased the level of rhythmical mineralocorticoid release and elevated rhythmical glucocorticoid release. The projected effect of salt-driven hormone rhythm modulation corresponded well with the measured decrease in water intake and an increase in urine volume with surplus osmolyte excretion.CONCLUSION. Humans regulate osmolyte and water balance by rhythmical mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid release, endogenous accrual of surplus body water, and precise surplus excretion.FUNDING.

Objective: To study the effect of Ramadan fast (RF) on
body composition, plasma constituents, hematology,
and cardiorespiratory responses to constant submaxi-
mal exercise. Subjects and Methods: Sixteen sedentary
healthy Kuwaiti adult males were included in the study.
The subjects were tested under thermo-neutral condi-
tions during a spring-like month of Ramadan and 2
months thereafter. They were tested during the week
before RF (Pre1); the last 3 days of RF (End1); the week
before a non-Ramadan month (Pre2), and the last 3 days
of the non-Ramadan month (End2). The following mea-
surements were made: body composition, cellular and
biochemical constituents of blood, heart rate, ventilatory
responses and blood pressure. Results: No significant
changes were observed in body composition, cellular
and biochemical constituents of blood. The heart rate
and ventilatory responses to the moderately intense
bouts of submaximal aerobic exercise (F 70% of VO 2max )
were significantly reduced (p ! 0.04) while systolic blood
pressure increased (p ! 0.05) by the end of RF. Conclu-
sions: Ramadan fasting had no adverse effect on the sub-
jects when performing aerobic exercise at submaximal
level. The mild changes in cardiorespiratory responses
could be due to dehydration, abstention from consump-
tion of substances with negative inotropy and circadian
rhythms.},

In this review we aim to comprehensively cover the field of âsleep and memoryâ research by providing a historical perspective on concepts and a discussion of more recent key findings. Whereas initial theories posed a passive role for sleep enhancing memories by protecting them from interfering stimuli, current theories highlight an active role for sleep in which memories undergo a process of system consolidation during sleep. Whereas older research concentrated on the role of rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, recent work has revealed the importance of slow-wave sleep (SWS) for memory consolidation and also enlightened some of the underlying electrophysiological, neurochemical, and genetic mechanisms, as well as developmental aspects in these processes. Specifically, newer findings characterize sleep as a brain state optimizing memory consolidation, in opposition to the waking brain being optimized for encoding of memories. Consolidation originates from reactivation of recently encoded neuronal memory representations, which occur during SWS and transform respective representations for integration into long-term memory. Ensuing REM sleep may stabilize transformed memories. While elaborated with respect to hippocampus-dependent memories, the concept of an active redistribution of memory representations from networks serving as temporary store into long-term stores might hold also for non-hippocampus-dependent memory, and even for nonneuronal, i.e., immunological memories, giving rise to the idea that the offline consolidation of memory during sleep represents a principle of long-term memory formation established in quite different physiological systems.},

Using experimental evolution, we show that key steps in this transition could have occurred quickly. We subjected the unicellular yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to an environment in which we expected multicellularity to be adaptive. We observed the rapid evolution of clustering genotypes that display a novel multicellular life history characterized by reproduction via multicellular propagules, a juvenile phase, and determinate growth. The multicellular clusters are uniclonal, minimizing within-cluster genetic conflicts of interest. Simple among-cell division of labor rapidly evolved. Early multicellular strains were composed of physiologically similar cells, but these subsequently evolved higher rates of programmed cell death (apoptosis), an adaptation that increases propagule production. These results show that key aspects of multicellular complexity, a subject of central importance to biology, can readily evolve from unicellular eukaryotes.},

Among mammals, unihemispheric sleep is restricted to aquatic species (Cetaceans, eared seals and manatees). In contrast to mammals, unihemispheric sleep is widespread in birds, and may even occur in reptiles. Unihemispheric sleep allows surfacing to breathe in aquatic mammals and predator detection in birds. Despite the apparent utility in being able to sleep unihemispherically, very few mammals sleep in this manner. This is particularly interesting since the reptilian ancestors to mammals may have slept unihemispherically. The relative absence of unihemispheric sleep in mammals suggests that a trade off exists between unihemispheric sleep and other adaptive brain functions occurring during sleep or wakefulness. Presumably, the benefits of sleeping unihemispherically only outweigh the costs under extreme circumstances such as sleeping at sea. Ultimately, a greater understanding of the reasons for little unihemispheric sleep in mammals promises to provide insight into the functions of sleep, in general. },

  abstract      = {Birds have overcome the problem of sleeping in risky situations by developing the ability to sleep with one eye open and one hemisphere of the brain awake1. Such unihemispheric slow-wave sleep is in direct contrast to the typical situation in which sleep and wakefulness are mutually exclusive states of the whole brain. We have found that birds can detect approaching predators during unihemispheric slow-wave sleep, and that they can increase their use of unihemispheric sleep as the risk of predation increases. We believe this is the first evidence for an animal behaviourally controlling sleep and wakefulness simultaneously in different regions of the brain.},

Approximately half the sample reported they had been bullied during their working lives. Apart from the gender of the bully, there were no significant differences in the bullying experience between men and women in the parameters examined in this paper. Many people reported being bullied in groups, which is contrary to the current anecdotal evidence. Those who had not been bullied anticipated a more assertive reaction to the situation than those who had been bullied actually took.

  abstract      = { The prospect of speed readingâreading at an increased speed without any loss of comprehensionâhas undeniable appeal. Speed reading has been an intriguing concept for decades, at least since Evelyn Wood introduced her Reading Dynamics training program in 1959. It has recently increased in popularity, with speed-reading apps and technologies being introduced for smartphones and digital devices. The current article reviews what the scientific community knows about the reading processâa great dealâand discusses the implications of the research findings for potential students of speed-reading training programs or purchasers of speed-reading apps. The research shows that there is a trade-off between speed and accuracy. It is unlikely that readers will be able to double or triple their reading speeds (e.g., from around 250 to 500â750 words per minute) while still being able to understand the text as well as if they read at normal speed. If a thorough understanding of the text is not the readerâs goal, then speed reading or skimming the text will allow the reader to get through it faster with moderate comprehension. The way to maintain high comprehension and get through text faster is to practice reading and to become a more skilled language user (e.g., through increased vocabulary). This is because language skill is at the heart of reading speed. },

  abstract      = {The metabolism of acetone was studied in lean and obese humans during starvation ketosis. Acetone concentrations in plasma, urine, and breath; and rates of endogenous production, elimination in breath and urine, and in vivo metabolism were determined. There was a direct relationship between plasma acetone turnover (20-77 Î¼mol/m2 per min) and concentration (0.19-1.68 mM). Breath and urinary excretion of acetone accounted for a 2-30% of the endogenous production rate, and in vivo metabolism accounted for the remainder. Plasma acetone oxidation accounted for â60% of the production rate in 3-d fasted subjects and about 25% of the production rate in 21-d fasted subjects. About 1-2% of the total CO2 production was derived from plasma acetone oxidation and was not related to the plasma concentration or production rate. Radioactivity from [14C]acetone was not detected in plasma free fatty acids, acetoacetate, Î²-hydroxybutyrate, or other anionic compounds, but was present in plasma glucose, lipids, and proteins. If glucose synthesis from acetone is possible in humans, this process could account for 11% of the glucose production rate and 59% of the acetone production rate in 21-d fasted subjects. During maximum acetonemia, acetone production from acetoacetate could account for 37% of the anticipated acetoacetate production, which implies that a significant fraction of the latter compound does not undergo immediate terminal oxidation.},

Spaced review consisted of presenting review frames of previously learned materials after Ss had received other interpolated learning tasks. Results indicated that variations in repetition had only transitory effects upon retention, but that spaced review produced a significant facilitation in retention of the reviewed material.

posed to be a protective response to preserve tissue integ-
rity in the extremities during cold exposure, but little
research exists on either the trainability or the spatial pat-
tern of CIVD response in the foot. We investigated the ther-
mal response across the foot with repeated cold exposure.
Ten healthy subjects immersed their left foot to the ankle in
8°C water for 30 min 5 days/week for 3 weeks. Skin tem-
perature was recorded on the medial side of the nail bed of
the 5 toes and the dorsum of the foot. The presence of
CIVD, deWned as an increase of 1°C at any time during
cooling, was rare with our protocol. While a CIVD
response was observed at least once in 8 of the 10 subjects,
only 122 instances of CIVD were observed out of a total of
900 possible observations (10 subjects £ 6 sites £ 15
trials). Furthermore, thermal habituation was not evi-
dent, with toe temperatures at the end of each immersion
(8–11°C) remaining near water temperature throughout the
15 sessions. Even within the two subjects exhibiting the most
incidence of CIVD, high variability existed in the occur-
rence, magnitude, and/or onset times. Synchronicity was
often observed where more than one toe exhibited CIVD,
though the magnitude varied greatly (range 1–9°C). We
conclude that, under realistic conditions of whole-foot
immersion in cold water, CIVD is not a common or train-
able response.

To the extent that the end of the Soviet Union and the independence of Estonia led to an increase in meritocratic selection of individuals in education and occupation, genetic influence should be higher in the post-Soviet era than in the Soviet era. Here we confirmed this hypothesis: DNA differences (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) explained twice as much variance in educational attainment and occupational status in the post-Soviet era compared with the Soviet era in both polygenic score analyses and single-nucleotide polymorphism heritability analyses of 12,500 Estonians. Our results demonstrate a change in the extent of genetic influence in the same population following a massive and abrupt social changeâin this case, the shift from a communist to a capitalist society.},

  abstract      = {Previous research has indicated that education influences cognitive development, but it is unclear what,
precisely, is being improved. Here, we tested whether education is associated with cognitive test score
improvements via domain-general effects on general cognitive ability (g), or via domain-specific effects
on particular cognitive skills. We conducted structural equation modeling on data from a large (n
1,091), longitudinal sample, with a measure of intelligence at age 11 years and 10 tests covering a diverse
range of cognitive abilities taken at age 70. Results indicated that the association of education with
improved cognitive test scores is not mediated by g, but consists of direct effects on specific cognitive
skills. These results suggest a decoupling of educational gains from increases in general intellectual
capacity.

  abstract      = {The still apt definition of a placenta is that coined by Mossman, namely apposition or fusion of the fetal membranes to the uterine mucosa for physiological exchange. As such it is a specialized organ whose purpose is to provide continuing support to the developing young. By this definition, placentas have evolved within every vertebrate class other than birds. They have evolved on multiple occasions, often within quite narrow taxonomic groups. As the placenta and the maternal system associate more intimately, such that the conceptus relies extensively on maternal support, the relationship leads to increased conflict that drives adaptive changes on both sides. The story of vertebrate placentation, therefore, is one of convergent evolution at both the macro- and molecular levels. In this short review, we first describe the emergence of placental-like structures in non-mammalian vertebrates and then transition to mammals themselves. We close the review by discussing mechanisms that might have favored diversity and hence evolution of the morphology and physiology of the placentas of eutherian mammals.},

HYPERKETONEMIA
The blood ketone-body concentration in fed humans and rats is usually
about 0.1 mM, but it increases readily in response to alterations in the physio-
logical state (Table 1). It is this wide range (some 30-fold) of concentration
that provides sensitivity for the role of ketone bodies as metabolic signals. In
normal humans there are small characteristic changes in blood concentrations
of acetoacetate and 3-hydroxybutyrate
during the day, but the cause of this
diurnal variation is not known (373,376). Concentrations remain low during the
morning and increase later in the day to reach a maximum at about midnight.
Greater increases in concentration occur in humans and rats (see Table 1) on
fasting (28,120,142,254,257,291),
feeding a high-fat diet (8,159,184,197,203),
after exercise (8, 52, 72, 92, 167, 246, 390), and during development in late
pregnancy (102, 179,280,300,378)
and in early neonatal life (142, 187,264,282,
283, 300, 325). Ketone-body concentrations may also increase as a result of a
metabolic disorder, as occurs in diabetes (26, 28, 122, 249, 318, 331, 354, 374),
and in some hypoglycemic conditions of childhood where there is a defect in
glucose or glycogen metabolism (9, 11, 116, 267, 279, 396). Interestingly, both
untreated and insulin-treated
diabetic patients show a diurnal variation in
ketone-body concentrations, although the pattern is slightly different from that
of normal individuals, with the major peak occurring in the early morning (374).
With the wide range of blood ketone-body concentrations owing to the sensitiv-
in
ity to physiological state (Table 1), it is useful to define hyperketonemia
humans as a whole-blood concentration of acetoacetate plus 3-hydroxybutyrate
of above 0.2 mM (334). By analogy to the definition of lactic acidosis (355), keto-
acidosis is considered to occur at concentrations greater than 7 mM.
The concentration of ketone bodies in the blood represents the balance
between their production by the liver and their utilization by peripheral tissues.
An increase in the circulating concentration generally is taken to indicate an
Ketone bodies (acetoacetate and D-3-hydroxybutyrate)
can act as oxidative
fuels, as lipogenic precursors, and as regulators of metabolism. In the latter role
ketone bodies can be viewed as signals of carbohydrate lack, and as such they are
intimately involved in the integration of whole-body metabolism to ensure
sparing of carbohydrate when it is in short supply. Our interest is primarily in
the physiological importance to the intact animal of these various roles and to
define them in individual extrahepatic tissues. The studies reviewed deal largely
with the rat and human, but examples are drawn on occasion from other mam-
mals. The term “ketone bodies” is taken to mean acetoacetate and D-3-hy-
droxybutyrate
and we make no mention of acetone, which is formed by non-
enzymic breakdown of acetoacetate and is unlikely to be important in metabo-
lism of the intact animal. Little reference is made to the early literature prior
to 1960, much of which is included in previous reviews of ketone-body metabo-
lism (see 54, 62, 191, 211, 341, 381).},

In both experiments, ten healthy male participants were exposed to an acute naturalistic stressor, helicopter underwater evacuation training (HUET), and their physiological and behavioural responses before (first study) and after (second study) the stressor were compared to ten non-stressed controls. The results of both experiments showed that working memory performance was preserved during anticipation of an acute stressor, but impairments were observed immediately after stress exposure. Participants reported significantly higher state anxiety levels during anticipation and following stress exposure, whereas significant elevations in cortisol levels were only observed 25 min post exposure to stress, but not before or immediately after stress exposure. The results of both experiments demonstrated a dissociation between behavioural and biochemical measures and provided evidence for a dissociation of the effects of stress on cognitive and physiological measures depending on the time of testing, with cognitive impairments most evident following stress exposure. },

The average daily energy intake was. 3000 Cal. for the air force and 3200 for the infantry group; the average energy expenditure for the 4 seasons was, on the basis of time activity data, 2800 Cal. daily. No appreciable weight change occurred and the subjects remained in excellent health. For the Eskimos, who came from 4 different localities in Alaska, the average daily energy intake was 3100 Cal. ; this maintained bodyweight. Daily energy expenditure was 2700 Cal. throughout the year. In composition the diet of the troops. in Alaska was not significantly different from that of U.S. troops stationed in temperate or tropical climates, but the air force group tended to eat more fat in the winter. The consumption of mineral salts was higher than the allowances recommended for temperate climates. There was no evidence of increase in vitamin requirements in Arctic climates.
It is concluded that the energy needs of normal men engaged in such activities under these climatic conditions are 3000 to 3500 Cal. per man daily at any season of the year.-G. F. Garton.},

When a global ban on DDT was proposed in 2001, several countries in sub-Saharan Africa claimed that DDT was still needed as a cheap and effective means for vector control. Although DDT is generally not toxic to human beings and was banned mainly for ecological reasons, subsequent research has shown that exposure to DDT at amounts that would be needed in malaria control might cause preterm birth and early weaning, abrogating the benefit of reducing infant mortality from malaria. Historically, DDT has had mixed success in Africa; only the countries that are able to find and devote substantial resources towards malaria control have made major advances. DDT might be useful in controlling malaria, but the evidence of its adverse effects on human health needs appropriate research on whether it achieves a favourable balance of risk versus benefit},

Are these brief instructional periods sufficient, or should the same amount of instruction be distributed over longer periods of time? This question was the focus of several recent studies in which a fixed amount of instruction was distributed over time periods of varying duration and followed by a delayed posttest. With few exceptions, the results showed that longer instructional periods produced greater posttest scores if the posttest was delayed by at least a month or so. Notably, the search criteria for this review excluded several oft-cited studies favoring short foreign language courses over longer ones, but a closer look at these studies reveals limitations (e.g., no delayed posttest or confounding variables). In brief, the best reading of the data is that long-term learning is best achieved when the exposures to a concept are distributed over time periods that are longer rather than shorter.},

When students encounter a set of concepts (or terms or
principles) that are similar in some way, they often
confuse one with another. For instance, they might
mistake one word for another word with a similar spelling
(e.g., allusion instead of illusion) or choose the wrong
strategy for a mathematics problem because it
resembles a different kind of problem. By one
proposition explored in this review, these kinds of errors
occur more frequently when all exposures to one of the
concepts are grouped together. For instance, in most
middle school science texts, the questions in each
assignment are devoted to the same concept, and this
blocking of exposures ensures that students need not
learn to distinguish between two similar concepts. In an
alternative approach described in this review, exposures
to each concept are interleaved with exposures to other
concepts, so that a question on one concept is followed
by a question on a different concept. In a number of
experiments that have compared interleaving and
blocking, interleaving produced better scores on final
tests of learning. The evidence is limited, though, and
ecologically-valid studies are needed. Still, a prudent
reading of the data suggests that at least a portion of the
exposures should be interleaved.},

  abstract      = {A typical mathematics assignment consists primarily of practice problems requiring the strategy introduced
in the immediately preceding lesson (e.g., a dozen problems that are solved by using the
Pythagorean theorem). This means that students know which strategy is needed to solve each problem
before they read the problem. In an alternative approach known as interleaved practice, problems from
the course are rearranged so that a portion of each assignment includes different kinds of problems in an
interleaved order. Interleaved practice requires students to choose a strategy on the basis of the problem
itself, as they must do when they encounter a problem during a comprehensive examination or subsequent
course. In the experiment reported here, 126 seventh-grade students received the same practice problems
over a 3-month period, but the problems were arranged so that skills were learned by interleaved practice
or by the usual blocked approach. The practice phase concluded with a review session, followed 1 or 30
days later by an unannounced test. Compared with blocked practice, interleaved practice produced higher
scores on both the immediate and delayed tests (Cohen’s ds 0.42 and 0.79, respectively).

  abstract      = {Sumary We have examined sperm morphology and dimensions in Eutherian mammals. In most Eutherians, sperm heads are round or oval and spermatozoa have short tails (average sperm length about 65 Î¼m; range = 33â121 Î¼m). Rodents, however, clearly depart from the typical Eutherian pattern in that they show a broad array of head morphs and an extreme range of sperm dimensions (35â250 Î¼m). In order to trace the evolutionary changes that rodent sperm have undergone, we have used phylogenetic relationships based on biogeographical, morphological, chromosomal and genic data, and we have superimposed onto them the information available on sperm traits. Analyses were carried out for five rodent groups on which enough information was available. The evolutionary trends which emerged from these studies have two main points in common throughout evolution spermatozoa have become enlarged and morphologically more complex, and this process seems to have taken place independently in different lineages. A general model was developed which outlines the different evolutionary pathways that rodent sperm have undergone. The adaptive significance of the increase in head complexity and the elongation of the sperm tail remains obscure. We have integrated information from evolutionary, physiological and behavioural studies to address this issue. We argue that two main selective forces may have favoured these changes: female selection within the reproductive tract and sperm competition. The female tract represents a formidable barrier for spermatozoa and it provides an environment where numerous interactions take place. The extent of these barriers and the complexity of these poorly understood interactions suggest that females may be exercising a strong selection, which may enable them to favour particular types of spermatozoa or ejaculates from particular males. Throughout their evolution males must have evolved adaptations to overcome these barriers, and the conflicting interests of choosy females. Sperm competition is a potent evolutionary force among mammals, which has influenced not only the evolution of sperm numbers but also changes in sperm dimensions. Thus, sperm competition has favoured the elongation of the sperm tail, which has led to the attainment of faster swimming speed, an important factor when sperm from rival males compete to reach the ova first.},

Maintenance of a 10% or greater reduced body weight is accompanied by decreases in energy expenditure to levels significantly below what is predicted solely on the basis of weight and body composition changes. This disproportionate decline in energy expenditure would not be sufficient to account for the over 80% recidivism rate to pre-weight loss levels of body fatness after otherwise successful weight reduction if there were a corresponding reduction in energy intake. In fact, reduced body weight maintenance is accompanied by increased energy intake above that required to maintain reduced weight. The failure to reduce energy intake in response to decreased energy output reflects decreased satiation and perception of how much food is eaten and multiple changes in neuronal signaling in response to food which conspire with the decline in energy output to keep body energy stores (fat) above a CNS- defined minimum (threshold). Much of this biological opposition to sustained weight loss is mediated by the adipocyte-derived hormone âleptinâ.},

In some species, programming of select male brain regions is dependent upon aromatization of testosterone to estrogen. In mammals, these hormones surge during the organizational and activational periods that occur during perinatal development and adulthood, respectively. In various fish and reptiles, incubation temperature during a critical embryonic period results in male or female sexual differentiation, but this can be overridden in males by early exposure to estrogenic chemicals. Testes development in mammals requires a Y chromosome and testis determining gene SRY (in humans)/Sry (all other therian mammals), although there are notable exceptions. Two species of spiny rats: Amami spiny rat (Tokudaia osimensis) and Tokunoshima spiny rat (Tokudaia tokunoshimensis) and two species of mole voles (Ellobius lutescens and Ellobius tancrei), lack a Y chromosome/Sry and possess an XO chromosome system in both sexes. Such rodent species, prototherians (monotremes, who also lack Sry), and fish and reptile species that demonstrate temperature sex determination (TSD) seemingly call into question the requirement of Sry for brain sexual differentiation. This review will consider brain regions expressing SRY/Sry in humans and rodents, respectively, and potential roles of SRY/Sry in the brain will be discussed. The evidence from various taxa disputing the requirement of Sry for brain sexual differentiation in mammals (therians and prototherians) and certain fish and reptilian species will be examined. A comparative approach to address this question may elucidate other genes, pathways, and epigenetic modifications stimulating brain sexual differentiation in vertebrate species, including humans.},

  abstract      = {Science rights itself by critical reanalysis of facts. Most scientists are hypercritical and very resistant to new claims in the absence of unscrutinized data. But once in a while some fake “fact” gets into the literature that is diffıcult to expunge. A recent case in point: the frequent assertion that the number of cells in the human microbiota is ten times as numerous as the number of cells in the human body (J. Fox, Microbe, December 2013, p. 494; M. Pollan, New York Times Magazine, May 15, 2013; Science 342:1440, 2013; Cell Metab. 12:111, 2010). Let’s think about it. The number of cells in the human microbiota is likely to be highly variable depending on nutritional input, body size, age, ethnicity, culture and environment. There could also be significant variability in body cell number among diverse humans in diverse environments and at different stages of life. Furthermore, it is diffıcult to determine the number of cells in the human body accurately. Finally, there is no a priori reason for thinking that the ratio of microbial to human cells is constant among humans or even for one individual in the course of a lifetime. Thus, the ratio of these two variable numbers is likely to be highly variable. Where did the numbers come from? As Schaechter and Maloy pointed out in their blog (http://schaechter.asmblog.org /schaechter/2010/07/power-of-ten.html), Savage (Ann. Rev. Microbiol. 31:107, 1977) is most often cited for stating that there are 1014 microbial cells, mostly in the gut, and 1013 human cells in the body. Savage refers to Luckey (Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 25:1292, 1972) for the number of cells in the gut, and Luckey bases this on estimates of 1011 bacteria/g of feces and an assumption of 1 kg of feces per adult. Clearly, these are imprecise numbers. More recently, total gut microbiota have been estimated at 3 1013–4 1014 (Suau et al, Appl Environ Microbiol. 65:4799, 1999). Luckey and Savage refer to Dobzhansky’s book (Genetics of the evolutionary process, Columbia University Press, New York, 1970) for the total number of human cells. The fırst sentence of Dobzhansky’s book states: “A man consists of some seven octillion (7 1027) atoms, grouped in about ten trillion (1013) cells.” No basis for this number is cited, but it seems reasonable to assume that Dobzhansky, a noted Drosophila population geneticist and evolutionist, did not himself determine this number experimentally, so it must be based on unidentifıed experiments or estimates. It is certainly not a statement that should be accepted on faith. Are there any good estimates for the number of human cells in the body? Bianconi et al (Ann. Hum. Biol. 40:463, 2013) have recently carried out an extensive review of the scientifıc literature on the number of human body cells. Virtually all of the references they found were in textbooks that did not explain or cite the basis for the given estimate. There was a 10,000-fold variation in these 30 estimates, ranging from 5 1012 to 7 1016, with one outlier of 2 1020. Using several values from the literature for the mean volume and weight of a mammalian cell, they calculated the number of human cells in the body as ranging from 1.5 to 72.4 1013. They also meticulously analyzed data from 10 organ systems and 30 cell types for which good data were available. They arrived at a partial total of 3.72 0.81 1013 cells. This discussion should make clear that the assertion of 10-fold more microbiota than human body cells was not based on hard facts. Scientists may have repeatedly cited this assertion because of laziness. Alternatively, scientists may have suspended criticality because this ratio dramatically conveys the idea of the human as ecosystem, and suggests important physiological roles for human microbiota. Even if these ideas are valid, we should be clear that the 10-fold ratio was crudely estimated and what should be cited is a range of values with appropriate qualifıers and primary references. The new American Academy of Microbiology report, “FAQ: Human Microbiome,” partly accomplishes this. Judah L},

People feel they understand complex phenomena with far greater precision, coherence, and depth
than they really do; they are subject to an illusion—an illusion of explanatory depth. The illusion
is far stronger for explanatory knowledge than many other kinds of knowledge, such as that for
facts, procedures or narratives. The illusion for explanatory knowledge is most robust where the
environment supports real-time explanations with visible mechanisms. We demonstrate the
illusion of depth with explanatory knowledge in Studies 1–6. Then we show differences in
overconfidence about knowledge across different knowledge domains in Studies 7–10. Finally, we
explore the mechanisms behind the initial confidence and behind overconfidence in Studies 11 and
12. Implications for the roles of intuitive theories in models of concepts and cognition are
discussed.

  abstract      = {The carnitineâacylcarnitine translocase (CACT) is one of the components of the carnitine cycle. The carnitine cycle is necessary to shuttle long-chain fatty acids from the cytosol into the intramitochondrial space where mitochondrial Î²-oxidation of fatty acids takes place. The oxidation of fatty acids yields acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) units, which may either be degraded to CO2 and H2O in the citric acid cycle to produce ATP or converted into ketone bodies which occurs in liver and kidneys. Metabolic consequences of a defective CACT are hypoketotic hypoglycaemia under fasting conditions, hyperammonemia, elevated creatine kinase and transaminases, dicarboxylic aciduria, very low free carnitine and an abnormal acylcarnitine profile with marked elevation of the long-chain acylcarnitines. Clinical signs and symptoms in CACT deficient patients, are a combination of energy depletion and endogenous toxicity. The predominantly affected organs are brain, heart and skeletal muscle, and liver, leading to neurological abnormalities, cardiomyopathy and arrythmias, skeletal muscle damage and liver dysfunction. Most patients become symptomatic in the neonatal period with a rapidly progressive deterioration and a high mortality rate. However, presentations at a later age with a milder phenotype have also been reported. The therapeutic approach is the same as in other long-chain fatty acid disorders and includes intravenous glucose (Â± insulin) administration to maximally inhibit lipolysis and subsequent fatty acid oxidation during the acute deterioration, along with other measures such as ammonia detoxification, depending on the clinical features. Long-term strategy consists of avoidance of fasting with frequent meals and a special diet with restriction of long-chain fatty acids. Due to the extremely low free carnitine concentrations, carnitine supplementation is often needed. Acylcarnitine profiling in plasma is the assay of choice for the diagnosis at a metabolite level. However, since the acylcarnitine profile observed in CACT-deficient patients is identical to that in CPT2-deficient patients, definitive identification of CACT-deficiency in a certain patient requires determination of the activity of CACT. Subsequently, mutational analysis of the CACT gene can be performed. So far, 9 different mutations have been identified in the CACT gene.},

  abstract      = {The toxin α-amanitin is frequently employed to completely block RNA synthesis by RNA polymerase II. However, we find that polymerase II ternary transcription complexes stalled by the absence of NTPs resume RNA synthesis when NTPs and amanitin are added. Chain elongation with amanitin can continue for hours at approximately 1% of the normal rate. Amanitin also greatly slows pyrophosphorolysis by elongation-competent complexes. Complexes which are arrested (that is, which have paused in transcription for long periods in the presence of excess NTPs) are essentially incapable of resuming transcription in the presence of α-amanitin. Complexes traversing sequences that can provoke arrest are much more likely to stop transcription in the presence of the toxin. The substitution of IMP for GMP at the 3′ end of the nascent RNA greatly increases the sensitivity of stalled transcription complexes to amanitin. Neither arrested nor stalled complexes display detectable SII-mediated transcript cleavage following amanitin treatment. However, arrested complexes possess a low level, intrinsic transcript cleavage activity which is completely amanitin-resistant; furthermore, pyrophosphorolytic transcript cleavage in arrested complexes is not affected by amanitin.},

While the assumption that men respond more to visual sexual stimuli is generally empirically supported, previous reports of sex differences are confounded by the variable content of the stimuli presented and measurement techniques. We propose that the cognitive processing stage of responding to sexual stimuli is the first stage in which sex differences occur. The divergence between men and women is proposed to occur at this time, reflected in differences in neural activation, and contribute to previously reported sex differences in downstream peripheral physiological responses and subjective reports of sexual arousal. Additionally, this review discusses factors that may contribute to the variability in sex differences observed in response to visual sexual stimuli. Factors include participant variables, such as hormonal state and socialized sexual attitudes, as well as variables specific to the content presented in the stimuli. Based on the literature reviewed, we conclude that content characteristics may differentially produce higher levels of sexual arousal in men and women. Specifically, men appear more influenced by the sex of the actors depicted in the stimuli while womenâs response may differ with the context presented. Sexual motivation, perceived gender role expectations, and sexual attitudes are possible influences. These differences are of practical importance to future research on sexual arousal that aims to use experimental stimuli comparably appealing to men and women and also for general understanding of cognitive sex differences.},

On 5 June 1995 an adult male mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) collided with the glass façade of the
Natuurmuseum Rotterdam and died. An other drake mallard raped the corpse almost continuously
for 75 minutes. Then the author disturbed the scene and secured the dead duck. Dissection
showed that the rape-victim indeed was of the male sex. It is concluded that the mallards were
engaged in an ‘Attempted Rape Flight’ that resulted in the first described case of homosexual
necrophilia in the mallard.

More precisely pupils belonging to the upper part of the socioeconomic scale perform better when homework is given, whereas pupils from the lowest part are unaffected. At the same time more disadvantaged children get less help from their parents with their homework. Homework can therefore amplify existing inequalities through complementarities with home inputs.},

Bacterial resistance to antibiotics has increased rapidly within recent years, and it has become
a serious threat to public health. Infections caused by multi-drug resistant bacteria entail higher
morbidity, mortality, and a burden to health care systems. The use of biocides, including silver
compounds, may affect the resistance to both biocides and antibiotics and, thereby, can be a
driving factor in this development.
The aim of the following thesis was to investigate the frequency of silver resistance and
the effects of silver exposure on bacterial populations being of clinical significance and from
geographically different parts of the world. Furthermore, it explored the genetic background of
silver resistance, and if silver could select directly or indirectly for antibiotic resistance.
By a range of methods, from culture in broth to whole genome sequencing, bacterial
populations from humans, birds and from the environment were characterized.
The studies showed that sil genes, encoding silver resistance, occurred at a high frequency.
Sil genes were found in 48 % of Enterobacter spp., in 41 % of Klebsiella spp. and in 21 %
of all human Escherichia coli isolates with production of certain types of extended-spectrum
beta-lactamases (CTX-M-14 and CTX-M-15). In contrast, silver resistance was not found in
bird isolates or in bacterial species, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Legionella spp., with
wet environments as their natural habitat. One silver-resistant Enterobacter cloacae strain was
isolated from a chronic leg ulcer after only three weeks of treatment with silver-based dressings.
The in-vivo effects of these dressings were limited, and they failed to eradicate both Grampositive
and Gram-negative bacteria. The activity of silver nitrate in vitro was bacteriostatic
on Gram-positive species such as S. aureus and bactericidal on Gram-negative species. In
Enterobacteriaceae, sil genes were associated with silver resistance phenotypes in all but one
case. Using whole genome sequencing, single nucleotide polymorphisms in the silS gene were
discovered after silver exposure in isolates with expressed silver resistance. This resistance
could co-select for resistance to beta-lactams, co-trimoxazole and gentamicin.
The findings of this thesis indicate that silver exposure may cause phenotypic silver
resistance, and it may reduce the susceptibility to mainly beta-lactams and select for bacteria
with resistance to clinically important antibiotics.

  abstract      = {Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading global cause of death, accounting for 17.3 million deaths per year. Preventive treatment that reduces CVD by even a small percentage can substantially reduce, nationally and globally, the number of people who develop CVD and the costs of caring for them. This American Heart Association presidential advisory on dietary fats and CVD reviews and discusses the scientific evidence, including the most recent studies, on the effects of dietary saturated fat intake and its replacement by other types of fats and carbohydrates on CVD. In summary, randomized controlled trials that lowered intake of dietary saturated fat and replaced it with polyunsaturated vegetable oil reduced CVD by â30\%, similar to the reduction achieved by statin treatment. Prospective observational studies in many populations showed that lower intake of saturated fat coupled with higher intake of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat is associated with lower rates of CVD and of other major causes of death and all-cause mortality. In contrast, replacement of saturated fat with mostly refined carbohydrates and sugars is not associated with lower rates of CVD and did not reduce CVD in clinical trials. Replacement of saturated with unsaturated fats lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, a cause of atherosclerosis, linking biological evidence with incidence of CVD in populations and in clinical trials. Taking into consideration the totality of the scientific evidence, satisfying rigorous criteria for causality, we conclude strongly that lowering intake of saturated fat and replacing it with unsaturated fats, especially polyunsaturated fats, will lower the incidence of CVD. This recommended shift from saturated to unsaturated fats should occur simultaneously in an overall healthful dietary pattern such as DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) or the Mediterranean diet as emphasized by the 2013 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology lifestyle guidelines and the 2015 to 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.},

  abstract      = {Recent replication attempts and large meta-analytic investigations have shown that the benefits of
cognitive-training programs hardly go beyond the trained task and similar tasks. However, it is yet
to be established whether the effects differ across cognitive-training programs and populations
(children, adults, and older adults). We addressed this issue by using second-order meta-analysis
(i.e., a meta-analysis of meta-analyses).
In Models 1 (k = 99) and 2 (k = 119), we investigated the impact of working-memory training on
near-transfer (i.e., memory) and far-transfer (e.g., reasoning, speed, and language) measures,
respectively. Model 3 (k = 233) extended Model 2 by adding six meta-analyses assessing the fartransfer
effects of other cognitive-training programs (video-games, music, chess, and exergames).
Model 1 showed that working-memory training does induce near transfer, and that the size of this
effect is moderated by the type of population. On the contrary, Models 2 and 3 highlighted that fartransfer
effects are small or null. Crucially, when placebo effects and publication bias were
controlled for, the overall effect size and true variance equaled zero. That is, no impact on fartransfer
measures was observed regardless of the type of population and cognitive-training program.
The lack of generalization of skills acquired by training is thus an invariant of human cognition.

In plants, protozoa, fungi, and nematodes, but apparently not insects and vertebrates, it involves a cell-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (cRdRP) that produces double-stranded RNA triggers from aberrant single-stranded RNA. We report the 2.3-{\r{A}} resolution crystal structure of QDE-1, a cRdRP from Neurospora crassa, and find that it forms a relatively compact dimeric molecule, each subunit of which comprises several domains with, at its core, a catalytic apparatus and protein fold strikingly similar to the catalytic core of the DNA-dependent RNA polymerases responsible for transcription. This evolutionary link between the two enzyme types suggests that aspects of RNA silencing in some organisms may recapitulate transcription/replication pathways functioning in the ancient RNA-based world.},

  abstract      = { The aim of this study was to analyse the prevalence and forms of workplace bullying among business professionals holding predominantly managerial or expert positions. A cross-sectional survey study was conducted among Finnish professionals with a university degree in business studies. In the study two different strategies for measuring bullying were used and compared. When provided a definition of bullying, 8.8\% of the respondents reported that they had at least occasionally been bullied during the past 12 months. However, when using a slightly modified version of the Negative Acts Questionnaire (Einarsen & Hoel, 2001), containing a list of 32 predefined negative and potentially harassing acts, as many as 24.1\% of the respondents reported that they had been subjected to at least one of the negative acts on a weekly basis. The respondents had experienced predominantly work-related negative acts, e.g., that their opinions and views were ignored, that they were given unreasonable deadlines, or that information was withheld. Although the prevalence rates reported with the two strategies varied considerably, there was still consistency between the two strategies in the sense that those who had classified themselves as bullied also reported higher exposure rates to almost all of the negative acts included. },

To evaluate this expectation, we conducted a meta-analysis of the responses of vertebrate prey in 45 replicated and 35 unreplicated field experiments in which the population densities of mammalian and avian predators had been manipulated. Our results showed that predator origin (native versus alien) had a highly significant effect on prey responses, with alien predators having an impact double that of native predators. Also the interaction between location (mainland versus island) and predator origin was significant, revealing the strongest effects with alien predators in mainland areas. Although both these results were mainly influenced by the huge impact of alien predators on the Australian mainland compared with their impact elsewhere, the results demonstrate that introduced predators can impose more intense suppression on remnant populations of native species and hold them further from their predator-free densities than do native predators preying upon coexisting prey.},

  abstract      = {Objectives: Cross-cultural sleep research is critical to deciphering whether modern sleep expression
is the product of recent selective pressures, or an example of evolutionary mismatch to
ancestral sleep ecology. We worked with the Hadza, an equatorial, hunter-gatherer community in
Tanzania, to better understand ancestral sleep patterns and to test hypotheses related to sleep
segmentation.
Methods: We used actigraphy to analyze sleep-wake patterns in thirty-three volunteers for a total
of 393 days. Linear mixed effects modeling was performed to assess ecological predictors of sleep
duration and quality. Additionally, functional linear modeling (FLM) was used to characterize 24-hr
time averaged circadian patterns.
Results: Compared with post-industrialized western populations, the Hadza were characterized by
shorter (6.25 hr), poorer quality sleep (sleep efficiency 5 68.9%), yet had stronger circadian
rhythms. Sleep duration time was negatively influenced by greater activity, age, light (lux) exposure,
and moon phase, and positively influenced by increased day length and mean nighttime
temperature. The average daily nap ratio (i.e., the proportion of days where a nap was present)
was 0.54 (SE 5 0.05), with an average nap duration of 47.5 min (SE 5 2.71; n 5 139).
Discussion: This study showed that circadian rhythms in small-scale foraging populations are
more entrained to their ecological environments than Western populations. Additionally, Hadza
sleep is characterized as flexible, with a consistent early morning sleep period yet reliance upon
opportunistic daytime napping. We propose that plasticity in sleep-wake patterns has been a target
of natural selection in human evolution.

  abstract      = {Over the past four decades, scientists have made substantial progress in understanding the evolution of sleep patterns across the Tree of Life. Remarkably, the specifics of sleep along the human lineage have been slow to emerge. This is surprising, given our unique mental and behavioral capacity and the importance of sleep for individual cognitive performance. One view is that our species' sleep architecture is in accord with patterns documented in other mammals. We promote an alternative view, that human sleep is highly derived relative to that of other primates. Based on new and existing evidence, we specifically propose that humans are more efficient in their sleep patterns than are other primates, and that human sleep is shorter, deeper, and exhibits a higher proportion of REM than expected. Thus, we propose the sleep intensity hypothesis: Early humans experienced selective pressure to fulfill sleep needs in the shortest time possible. Several factors likely served as selective pressures for more efficient sleep, including increased predation risk in terrestrial environments, threats from intergroup conflict, and benefits arising from increased social interaction. Less sleep would enable longer active periods in which to acquire and transmit new skills and knowledge, while deeper sleep may be critical for the consolidation of those skills, leading to enhanced cognitive abilities in early humans.},

  abstract      = {Objective: To compare different scoring parameter settings in actigraphy software for inferring sleep and
wake bouts for validating analytical techniques outside of laboratory environments.
Design: To identify parameter settings that best identify napping during periods of wakefulness, we
analyzed 137 days on which participants reported daytime napping, as compared with a random subset
of 30 days when no naps were reported. To identify settings that identify periods of wakefulness during
sleep, we used data from a subsample of women who reported discrete wake bouts while nursing at night.
Setting: Equatorial Tanzania in January to February 2016.
Participants: The Hadza—a non-industrial foraging population.
Measurements: Thirty-three subjects participated in the study for 393 observation days. Using the Bland-
Altman technique to determine concordance, we analyzed reported events of daytime napping and night-
time wake bouts.
Results: Only 1 parameter setting could reliably detect reported naps (15-minute nap length, ≤50 counts).
Moreover, of the 6 tested parameter settings to detect wake bouts, the setting where the sleep-wake
algorithm was parameterized to detect 20 consecutive minutes throughout the designated sleep period
did not overestimate or underestimate wake bouts, had the lowest mean difference, and did not
significantly differ from reported wake-bout events.
Conclusion: We propose operational definitions for multiple dimensions of segmented sleep and conclude
that actigraphy is an effective method for detecting segmented sleep in future cross-site comparative
research. The implications of such work are far reaching, as sleep research in preindustrial and developing
societies is documenting natural sleep-wake patterns in previously inaccessible environments.

Arsenic removal from 0, 1, or 10% Hoagland nutrient solution containing 0â100Â Î¼M arsenate was followed over 192Â h, and the total As in aquatic moss after treatment was analysed. The uptake and speciation of As in moss cultivated in water containing 10Â Î¼M arsenate or arsenite were examined as As uptake in living (absorptionÂ +Â adsorption) and dead (adsorption) plant parts. Results indicated that W.Â fluitans removed up to 82% of As from the water within one hour when 1Â Î¼M arsenate was added in the absence of nutrients. The removal time increased with greater nutrient and As concentrations. Up to 100Â Î¼M As had no toxic effect on the plant biomass. Both arsenite and arsenate were removed from the solution to similar extents and, independent of the As species added, more arsenate than arsenite was found in the plant. Of the As taken up, over 90% was firmly bound to the tissue, a possible mechanism for resisting high As concentrations. Arsenic was both absorbed and adsorbed by the moss, and twice as much As was found in living parts as in dead moss tissue. This study revealed that W.Â fluitans has potential to serve as a phytofilter for removing As from As-contaminated water without displaying any toxic effects of the metalloid.},

We did not observe any polygynous social units in our study period although polygyny exists in the population. We found little difference in the numbers of eggs laid, and egg volume between monogamous and polyandrous nests.

Among mating strategies, female genetic polyandry and male reproductive cooperation pose challenging evolutionary questions regarding the maintenance of systems where one sex suffers from reduced fitness. Here, we investigate the consequences of social and genetic polyandry for reproductive success of females and males in a population of the dunnock, Prunella modularis. We show that female multiple mating ameliorates the negative effects of inbreeding. We, however, found little evidence that females engage in extra-group (pair) mating with less related or more heterozygous males. Breeding in socially polyandrous groups reduced the amount of paternity lost to extra-group males, such that, on average, cobreeding and monogamous males fledged a similar number of young. Importantly, c. 30% of cobreeding male dyads were related, suggesting they could gain indirect fitness benefits. Taken together, cobreeding males achieve equivalent reproductive success to monogamous counterparts under most circumstances. Our study has revealed unexpected complexities in the variable mating system of dunnocks in New Zealand. Our results differ from the well-known Cambridge dunnock study and can help our understanding of the evolution and maintenance of various breeding systems in the animal kingdom.},

Its products have been reported to take part on the variety of compounds and reactions that together build an individual's body odor. It has been suggested, therefore, that animals use body odor as a guide to identify possible mates as MHC-similar or MHC-dissimilar from their own genotype. Preference for a MHC-dissimilar partner enhances \{MHC\} heterozygosity of an individual's offspring. The possible adaptive advantages are clear: it is a mechanism of avoiding inbreeding and MHC-heterozygous offspring may have enhanced immunocompetence. The aim of this study was to search, in our species, new evidence on the correlation between specificities at HLA-A and HLA-B and assessments of pleasantness regarding specific body odors. \{HLA\} is the name for the human MHC. Four olfactory sessions were performed with 58 young Southern Brazilian students, in order to investigate whether assessments of pleasantness of body odors from individuals correlate to a person's \{HLA\} phenotype. Body odors were collected via sweat and urine from all participants. Women smelled and scored all male odor samples and men did the same with all female samples. We found a significant correlation only when female smellers evaluated male sweat odors.},

Measurements were made during a control period of total starvation, during the ingestion of 7.5 g carbohydrate daily, and finally during the ingestion of 15.0 g carbohydrate daily. Daily ketoacid excretion fell after carbohydrate ingestion and was significantly correlated (r = 0.62, P < 0.01) with the amount of carbohydrate administered. Despite this fall in ketoacids, the concentration of blood ketoacids, plasma free fatty acids, and serum insulin remained constant throughout the study. Urinary ammonium excretion, closely correlated with ketoacid output (r = 0.95, P < 0.001), also fell significantly after carbohydrate ingestion. No significant changes were present in extracellular or urinary pH. Urea nitrogen excretion did not change when urinary ammonium output fell. These results indicate that: the excretion of ketoacids and ammonium in starving man is exquisitely sensitive to minute amounts of ingested carbohydrate; the change in ketonuria appears to be due to increased renal ketoacid reabsorption after carbohydrate ingestion; and the nitrogen-sparing effect of reducing renal ammonium output in starvation can be dissociated from nitrogen sparing occurring because of changes in urine urea excretion.},

Addition of insulin or a physiological ratio of ketone bodies to buffer with 10 mM glucose increased efficiency (hydraulic work/energy from O2 consumed) of working rat heart by 25%, and the two in combination increased efficiency by 36%. These additions increased the content of acetyl CoA by 9- to 18-fold, increased the contents of metabolites of the first third of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle 2- to 5-fold, and decreased succinate, oxaloacetate, and aspartate 2- to 3-fold. Succinyl CoA, fumarate, and malate were essentially unchanged. The changes in content of TCA metabolites resulted from a reduction of the free mitochondrial NAD couple by 2- to 10-fold and oxidation of the mitochondrial coenzyme Q couple by 2- to 4-fold. Cytosolic pH, measured using 31P-NMR spectra, was invariant at about 7.0. The total intracellular bicarbonate indicated an increase in mitochondrial pH from 7.1 with glucose to 7.2, 7.5 and 7.4 with insulin, ketones, and the combination, respectively. The decrease in Eh7 of the mitochondrial NAD couple, Eh7NAD+/NADH, from -280 to -300 mV and the increase in Eh7 of the coenzyme Q couple, Eh7Q/QH2, from -4 to +12 mV was equivalent to an increase from -53 kJ to -60 kJ/2 mol e in the reaction catalyzed by the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase multienzyme complex (EC 1.6.5.3). The increase in the redox energy of the mitochondrial cofactor couples paralleled the increase in the free energy of cytosolic ATP hydrolysis, delta GATP. The potential of the mitochondrial relative to the cytosolic phases, Emito/cyto, calculated from delta GATP and delta pH on the assumption of a 4 H+ transfer for each ATP synthesized, was -143 mV during perfusion with glucose or glucose plus insulin, and decreased to -120 mV on addition of ketones. Viewed in this light, the moderate ketosis characteristic of prolonged fasting or type II diabetes appears to be an elegant compensation for the defects in mitochondrial energy transduction associated with acute insulin deficiency or mitochondrial senescence.},

Although these processes are well understood for nucleic acid?based genes, the mechanisms by which protein-only or prion-based genetic elements direct phenotypic inheritance are poorly understood. Here, we report a process crucial for inheritance of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae prion [PSI+], a self-replicating conformer of the Sup35 protein. By tightly controlling expression of a Sup35-GFP fusion, we directly observe remodeling of existing Sup35[PSI+] complexes in vivo. This dynamic change in Sup35[PSI+] is lost when the molecular chaperone Hsp104, a factor essential for propagation of all yeast prions, is functionally impaired. The loss of Sup35[PSI+] remodeling by Hsp104 decreases the mobility of these complexes in the cytosol, creates a segregation bias that limits their transmission to daughter cells, and consequently diminishes the efficiency of conversion of newly made Sup35 to the prion form. Our observations resolve several seemingly conflicting reports on the mechanism of Hsp104 action and point to a single Hsp104-dependent event in prion propagation.},

Toxicon28, 83–89, 1990.—The effect of phoratoxin B on transmembrane potentials and currents of frog skeletal muscle was studied using intracellular microelectrode recording and double sucrose gap voltage clamp techniques. Phoratoxin B irreversibly depolarized the membrane. The depolarization was insensitive to tetrodotoxin, tetraethylammonium, 4-aminopyridine, cesium, cadmium and D-600. In voltage clamp experiments, phoratoxin B induced an inward resting current (Irest) which did not inactivate. Irest was blocked by increasing the external calcium concentration in the Ringer solution; it was not blocked when Sr2+ replaced Ca2+. Analysis of the peak sodium current indicated that while both Ca2+ and Sr2+ screen membrane surface charges, Ca2+ bound and reversed the phoratoxin B induced Irest whereas Sr2+ did not. The inward Irest induced by phoratoxin B developed in the presence of external chloride and remained unchanged in the presence of bicarbonate. The data suggest that the depolarizing action of the toxin might be attributed to an increase in the non-selective leak current and that it might act as a detergent.},

Allopatric speciation, the divergence of species resulting from geographical isolation, is well documented1. However, sympatric speciation, divergence without geographical isolation, is highly controversial2. Claims of sympatric speciation must demonstrate species sympatry, sister relationships, reproductive isolation, and that an earlier allopatric phase is highly unlikely1. Here we provide clear support for sympatric speciation in a case study of two species of palm (Arecaceae) on an oceanic island. A large dated phylogenetic tree shows that the two species of Howea, endemic to the remote Lord Howe Island, are sister taxa and diverged from each other well after the island was formed 6.9 million years ago3. During fieldwork, we found a substantial disjunction in flowering time that is correlated with soil preference. In addition, a genome scan4, 5 indicates that few genetic loci are more divergent between the two species than expected under neutrality, a finding consistent with models of sympatric speciation involving disruptive/divergent selection2. This case study of sympatric speciation in plants provides an opportunity for refining theoretical models on the origin of species, and new impetus for exploring putative plant and animal examples on oceanic islands.},

Following cold exposure, the aerobic capacity of skeletal muscle in these animals is greatly increased. We investigated the effects of this plastic response to thermogenesis on locomotion and muscle mechanics. In cold-exposed animals, cost of transport was 15% higher than in controls but was unaffected by exercise training. Twitch kinetics in isolated semitendinosus muscles of cold-exposed animals were characteristic of slow-oxidative fiber types. Both time-to-peak tension and half-relaxation time were longer and maximal shortening velocity was slower following cold exposure compared to either thermoneutral controls or exercise-trained animals. Further, muscles from the cold-exposed animals had greater fatigue resistance than either control or exercise-trained animals, indicating greater oxidative capacity. Finally, we identified an uncoupling protein 3 homologue, whose gene expression was upregulated in skeletal muscle of cold-exposed Monodelphis domestica. Cold exposure provided a potent stimulus for muscle plasticity, driving a fast-to-slow transition more effectively than exercise training. However, linked to the dramatic shift in muscle properties is an equally dramatic increase in whole animal muscle energetics during locomotion, suggesting an uncoupled state, or `training for inefficiency'.},

interaction between short-term adaptation to apneas with
face immersion and erythrocyte release from the spleen.
Twenty healthy volunteers, including ten splenectomized
subjects, participated. After prone rest, they performed five
maximal-duration apneas with face immersion in 10°C water,
with 2-min intervals. Cardiorespiratory parameters and
venous blood samples were collected. In subjects with
spleens, hematocrit and hemoglobin concentration increased
by 6.4% and 3.3%, respectively, over the serial apneas and
returned to baseline 10 min after the series. A delay of the
physiological breaking point of apnea, by 30.5% (17 s), was
seen only in this group. These parameters did not change in
the splenectomized group. Plasma protein concentration,
preapneic alveolar PCO2, inspired lung volume, and diving
bradycardia remained unchanged throughout the series in
both groups. Serial apneas thus triggered the hematological
changes that have been previously observed after long apneic
diving shifts; they were rapidly reversed and did not occur in
splenectomized subjects. This suggests that splenic contraction
occurs in humans as a part of the diving response and
may prolong repeated apneas.

Seals have large spleens and while human spleen size is small in comparison, it shows great individual variation. Unlike many marine mammals, human divers rely to a great extent on lung oxygen stores, but the impact of lung volume on competitive apnea performance has never been determined. We studied if spleen- and lung size correlated with performance in elite apnea divers. Volunteers were 14 male apnea world championship participants, with a mean (SE) of 5.8 (1.2)âyears of previous apnea training. Spleen volume was calculated from spleen length, width, and thickness measured via ultrasound during rest, and vital capacity via spirometry. Accumulated competition scores from dives of maximal depth, time, and distance were compared to anthropometric measurements and training data. Mean (SE) diving performance was 75 (4)âm for constant weight depth, 5âmin 53 (39)âs for static apnea and 139 (13)âm for dynamic apnea distance. Subjectsâ mean height was 184 (2)âcm, weight 82 (3)âkg, vital capacity (VC) 7.3 (0.3)âL and spleen volume 336 (32)âmL. Spleen volume did not correlate with subject height or weight, but was positively correlated with competition score (râ=â0.57; Pâ<â0.05). Total competition score was also positively correlated with VC (râ=â0.54; Pâ<â0.05). The three highest scoring divers had the greatest spleen volumes, averaging 538 (53)âmL, while the three lowest-scoring divers had a volume of 270 (71)âmL (Pâ<â0.01). VC was also greater in the high-scorers, at 7.9 (0.36)âL as compared to 6.7 (0.19)âL in the low scorers (Pâ<â0.01). Spleen volume was reduced to half after 2âmin of apnea in the highest scoring divers, and the estimated resting apnea time gain from the difference between high and low scorers was 15âs for spleen volume and 60âs for VC.

However, it is still unclear how important retesting strategies are to the learning of relevant factual knowledge in undergraduate medical education. Methodsâ Eighty students in Years 3â5 of medical school in Munich participated in a prospective, randomised, doubleâblinded, controlled study in which they were exposed to 30 electronic flashcards designed to help them memorise key factual knowledge in the domain of clinical nephrology. The flashcards were presented in four successive learning cycles, each consisting of a study period and a subsequent test period. Half of all participants were randomised to repetitive studying (restudy group) and half were randomised to repetitive testing (retest group) of successfully memorised flashcards. Knowledge retention was assessed after 1âweek and 6âmonths. Additionally, personal data, selfâreflection on the efficacy of the learning strategies and judgements of learning were obtained by questionnaires. Resultsâ Repetitive testing promoted better recall than repetitive studying after 1âweek (pâ<â0.001). However, after 6âmonths general recall was poor and no difference between the restudy and retest groups was observed. Time on task and number of trials, in addition to sex, age, performance and psychoâsocial background, did not vary between the groups. Selfâpredictions of student performance did not correlate with actual performance. Conclusionsâ In the context of using electronic flashcards, repetitive testing is a more potent learning strategy than repetitive studying for shortâterm but not longâterm knowledge retention in clinical medical students. Although students use testing as a learning strategy, they seem to be unaware of its superiority in supporting shortâterm knowledge retention.},

Objective: We aimed to examine the conclusions, statistical significance, and reproducibility in the literature on associations between specific foods and cancer risk.

Design: We selected 50 common ingredients from random recipes in a cookbook. PubMed queries identified recent studies that evaluated the relation of each ingredient to cancer risk. Information regarding author conclusions and relevant effect estimates were extracted. When >10 articles were found, we focused on the 10 most recent articles.

Results: Forty ingredients (80%) had articles reporting on their cancer risk. Of 264 single-study assessments, 191 (72%) concluded that the tested food was associated with an increased (n = 103) or a decreased (n = 88) risk; 75% of the risk estimates had weak (0.05 > P ≥ 0.001) or no statistical (P > 0.05) significance. Statistically significant results were more likely than nonsignificant findings to be published in the study abstract than in only the full text (P < 0.0001). Meta-analyses (n = 36) presented more conservative results; only 13 (26%) reported an increased (n = 4) or a decreased (n = 9) risk (6 had more than weak statistical support). The median RRs (IQRs) for studies that concluded an increased or a decreased risk were 2.20 (1.60, 3.44) and 0.52 (0.39, 0.66), respectively. The RRs from the meta-analyses were on average null (median: 0.96; IQR: 0.85, 1.10).

Conclusions: Associations with cancer risk or benefits have been claimed for most food ingredients. Many single studies highlight implausibly large effects, even though evidence is weak. Effect sizes shrink in meta-analyses.},

Snow and sleet were common and night temperatures were usually around 3–5°C. The men had enough food and kept busy hiking, fishing and hunting, but deliberately subjected themselves to a great deal of cold stress. At night they undressed and slept in a single blanket bag with a hydrophobic cover. After 6 weeks in the field they had acquired a considerable acclimation to the cold stress. They slept well and maintained a warm surface all night. During rest their heat production remained on an average 50–55% higher than the basal rate before the acclimation. Most of the men developed a slight rise in the BMR. Shivering, visible or detectable by electromyography, occurred frequently during sleep. Control subjects on an average mobilized less extra heat, and were unable to rest and sleep, due to chilling of the periphery, especially the feet. In the acclimated men, therefore, an increased heat production alleviated the shell cooling from which the unacclimated men suffered. When bicycling naked in the cold, just enough to maintain the rectal temperature, the cold acclimated men used as much oxygen as the controls, so neither during exercise nor during rest did acclimation result in increased insulation by shell cooling. The metabolic acclimation to cold found in man agrees with data obtained on other homeotherms},

Oxygen consumption and rectal and skin temperatures were taken every half hour throughout the night a) while the natives were resting naked on the ground between their camp fires and b) while they rested naked without fires in a single-blanket sleeping bag, subjected to a moderate, but known, cold stress. The air temperature frequently dropped to 0°;C in the early morning. It was found that the camp fires on windless nights could readily supply enough heat to keep both the natives and whites in heat balance throughout the night and resting under basal conditions. In tests with the subjects in light sleeping bags without fires, the natives underwent a considerable peripheral skin cooling, with their foot temperatures dropping regularly to 12°–15°C. They slept soundly through the night with normal resting heat production. The white controls cooled almost as much, but unable to rest, they shivered and thrashed about all night, with a corresponding elevation of metabolism. The cooling adaptation of the Australian aborigines, which resembles the insulative cooling commonly found in mammals, differs from the metabolic compensation and greater peripheral heating developed in cold-acclimated white man.},

  abstract      = {Abstract To best remediate academic deficiencies, educators need to not only identify empirically validated interventions but also be able to apply instructional modifications that result in more efficient student learning. The current study compared the effect of massed and distributed practice with an explicit timing intervention to evaluate the extent to which these modifications lead to increased math fact fluency on basic addition problems. Forty-eight third-grade students were placed into one of three groups with each of the groups completing four 1-min math explicit timing procedures each day across 19days. Group one completed all four 1-min timings consecutively; group two completed two back-to-back 1-min timings in the morning and two back-to-back 1-min timings in the afternoon, and group three completed one, 1-min independent timing four times distributed across the day. Growth curve modeling was used to examine the progress throughout the course of the study. Results suggested that students in the distributed practice conditions, both four times per day and two times per day, showed significantly higher fluency growth rates than those practicing only once per day in a massed format. These results indicate that combining distributed practice with explicit timing procedures is a useful modification that enhances student learning without the addition of extra instructional time when targeting math fact fluency.},

Negative mood symptoms remain one of the major reasons for discontinuation of combined oral contraceptive pills (COCs). The primary aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders in women with different experience of COCs.

Study Design
Thirty women currently on COCs with no report of adverse mood symptoms, 28 women currently on COCs and experiencing mood-related side effects, 33 women who had discontinued COC use due to adverse mood effects and 27 women who had discontinued COC use for reasons other than adverse mood symptoms were included. Ongoing psychiatric disorders were evaluated by a structured psychiatric interview and prevalence rates of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) were assessed by daily prospective ratings on the Cyclicity Diagnoser scale.

Results
Women with ongoing or past experience of COC-induced adverse mood, more often suffered from mood disorders than women with no reports of adverse mood while on COC. The prevalence of prospectively defined PMS or PMDD did not differ between prior users with positive or negative experience. Women who had discontinued COC use due to adverse mood symptoms more often had had a legal abortion in the past.

Conclusion

  abstract      = {Lactase persistenceâthe ability of adults to digest the lactose in milkâvaries widely in frequency across human populations. This trait represents an adaptation to the domestication of dairying animals and the subsequent consumption of their milk. Five variants are currently known to underlie this phenotype, which is monogenic in Eurasia but mostly polygenic in Africa. Despite being a textbook example of regulatory convergent evolution and gene-culture coevolution, the story of lactase persistence is far from clear: Why are lactase persistence frequencies low in Central Asian herders but high in some African hunter-gatherers? Why was lactase persistence strongly selected for even though milk processing can reduce the amount of lactose? Are there other factors, outside of an advantage of caloric intake, that contributed to the selective pressure for lactase persistence? It is time to revisit what we know and still do not know about lactase persistence in humans.},

  abstract      = {Abstract Sexual pleasure comes in various forms of physical play, for many it involves stimulation of the vagina, while the anus for others; some enjoy both. A recent report by Cappelletti etÂ al.1 shows a meta-analysis of cases describing anal trauma due to sexual fisting in human partners. This clinical article reports four cases of males diagnosed with zoophilia, and who received anal sex from animals, resulting in injuries. Surgical and psychiatric evaluations are summarized. Unusual etiology of sexual activity with animals caused peri-anal trauma in men who engaged in anal sex with dogs and farm animals. Injuries to patients who receive anal sex from animals are mechanistically similar to fisting-induced rectal damage. Among zoophiles, the mode of harm occurs through blood-engorged, interlocked penis that causes tissue lacerations upon retraction from an anus. In people experimenting with fisting, repetitive stretching within anal canal and of external sphincter causes the internal injuries. The mode of physical stimulation explains the extent of injuries in fisters vs. zoophiles: in fisting, the pressure applied by hand is controllable proximally around and within anal sphincter, while penetration by the animal penis is unpredictable and occurs within the proximal anal canal. Forensically, the findings presented in this article describe a significant mechanism of injury in fisters versus passive zoophiles. These descriptions may aid in clinically differentiating pleasurable and pathological rectal stimulation.},

with the consumption of native foods, but in recent years outbreaks have occurred in previously unaffected areas and
have involved new food items. Five botulism outbreaks occurred between 1975 and 1985 in an area of southwestern
Alaska without previous confirmed outbreaks and among one ethnic group, the Yupik Eskimo. Of the 5 outbreaks, 3
were associated with fermented beaver tail, a nontraditional native food recently introduced into the region.
Preparation techniques vary widely within villages and among ethnic groups. Traditional fermentation techniques
have changed over the past 50 years; current preparation methods used by some families and ethnic groups may be
more favorable for Clostridium botulinum growth. Prevention efforts should be targeted at high-risk subgroups of
Alaska Natives who appear to have modified traditional practices and increased their risk of food-borne botulism.

  abstract      = {Background 5 Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) and tryptophan are so-called natural alternatives to traditional antidepressants, used to treat unipolar depression and dysthymia. Objectives To determine whether 5-HTP and tryptophan are more effective than placebo, and whether they are safe to use to treat depressive disorders in adults. Search methods CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References were searched on 12/2/2008). Reference lists, book chapters and conference proceedings were checked. Experts and trialists were contacted for unpublished studies. Selection criteria Trials were included if they were randomized, included patients with unipolar depression or dysthymia, compared preparations of 5- HTP or tryptophan with placebo, and included clinical outcomes assessed by scales assessing depressive symptoms. Data collection and analysis Data was extracted independently by the three reviewers, onto data collection forms. Inclusion criteria were applied to all potential studies independently and a coefficient of agreement (Kappa) was calculated for them. Disagreement was resolved by reaching consensus. Trial quality was scored according to risk of bias. Analysis for 5-HTP and tryptophan were combined due to the small number of included trials. Main results 108 trials were located using the specified search strategy in 2001. An additional three trials were located when the search strategy was repeated in 2004. Of the total number of trials located in both searches, only two trials, involving a total of 64 patients, were of sufficient quality to meet inclusion criteria. The available evidence suggests these substances were better than placebo at alleviating depression (Peto Odds Ratio 4.10; 95% confidence interval 1.28-13.15; RD 0.36; NNT 2.78). However, the evidence was of insufficient quality to be conclusive. Authors’ conclusions A large number of studies appear to address the research questions, but few are of sufficient quality to be reliable. Available evidence does suggest these substances are better than placebo at alleviating depression. Further studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 5-HTP and tryptophan before their widespread use can be recommended. The possible association between these substances and the potentially fatal Eosinophilia-Myalgia Syndrome has not been elucidated. Because alternative antidepressants exist which have been proven to be effective and safe the clinical usefulness of 5-HTP and tryptophan is limited at present. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY Tryptophan and 5-Hydroxytryptophan for depression 5-HTP (Hydroxytryptophan) and tryptophan have been examined to see whether these treatments are effective, safe and acceptable in treating unipolar depression in adults. The researchers reported that the symptoms of depression decreased when 5-HTP and tryptophan were compared to a placebo (non-drug). However, side effects had occurred (dizziness, nausea and diarrhoea). They also reported that tryptophan has been associated with the development of a fatal condition. More evidence is needed to assess efficacy and safety, before any strong and meaningful conclusions can be made. Until then, the reviewers propose that the use of antidepressants which have no known life threatening side effects remain more attractive. The review sets out the required methodology for effectively studying these substances in proper controlled studies.},

These form a continuous proteinaceous matrix in the cells of the mature dry grain and are brought together to form a continuous viscoelastic network when flour is mixed with water to form dough. These viscoelastic properties underpin the utilization of wheat to give bread and other processed foods. One group of gluten proteins, the HMM subunits of glutenin, is particularly important in conferring high levels of elasticity (i.e. dough strength). These proteins are present in HMM polymers that are stabilized by disulphide bonds and are considered to form the {\textquoteleft}elastic backbone{\textquoteright} of gluten. However, the glutamine{\textendash}rich repetitive sequences that comprise the central parts of the HMM subunits also form extensive arrays of interchain hydrogen bonds that may contribute to the elastic properties via a {\textquoteleft}loop and train{\textquoteright} mechanism. Genetic engineering can be used to manipulate the amount and composition of the HMM subunits, leading to either increased dough strength or to more drastic changes in gluten structure and properties.},

  abstract      = {Proteins interact with each other in a highly specific manner, and protein interactions play a key role in many cellular processes; in particular, the distortion of protein interfaces may lead to the development of many diseases. To understand the mechanisms of protein recognition at the molecular level and to unravel the global picture of protein interactions in the cell, different experimental techniques have been developed. Some methods characterize individual protein interactions while others are advanced for screening interactions on a genome-wide scale. In this review we describe different experimental techniques of protein interaction identification together with various databases which attempt to classify the large array of experimental data. We discuss the main promises and pitfalls of different methods and present several approaches to verify and validate the diverse experimental data produced by high-throughput techniques.},

behavior of healthy individuals. This study, conducted as part of a test of a nutritionally balanced but calorie-deficient experimental
ration, examined the effects of 30 days of undernutrition on healthy, physically active soldiers. Tests of reaction time and standardized
questionnaires assessing mood and symptom parameters (known to be sensitive to nutritional and other factors) were administered prior
to and following a 30-day field exercise. During the exercise, 17 soldiers consumed a calorie-deficient, lightweight ration (LW group,
1946 kcal/day) and 17 consumed a calorie-adequate control ration (FN group, 2782 kcal/day). Mean energy expenditure for both groups
was 3200–3300 kcal/day. There were no differences between the two diet groups on any of the measures of reaction time, mood, or
symptoms after 30 days of ration consumption. Additionally, there were no adverse changes in reaction time performance from preto
post-testing. Adverse changes in moods and symptoms were seen in both groups at the conclusion of the test, possibly because of
the rigors of living in the field for an extended period of time. This study demonstrates that, in healthy individuals, various aspects of
mental performance, mood, and symptoms are not affected by up to 30 days of moderate undernutrition. © 1997 Elsevier Science Inc.},

Background

The rapid emergence of coronary artery disease (CAD) in south Asian people is not explained by conventional risk factors. In view of cardioprotective effects of a Mediterranean style diet rich in α-linolenic acid, we assessed the benefits of this diet for patients at high risk of CAD.

Methods

We did a randomised, single-blind trial in 1000 patients with angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, or surrogate risk factors for CAD. 499 patients were allocated to a diet rich in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, walnuts, and almonds. 501 controls consumed a local diet similar to the step I National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) prudent diet.

Findings

Rndings The intervention group consumed more fruits, vegetables, legumes, walnuts, and almonds than did controls (573 g [SD 127] vs 231 g [19] per day p<0·001). The intervention group had an increased intake of whole grains and mustard or soy bean oil. The mean intake of a-linolenic acid was two-fold greater in the intervention group (1·8 g [SD 0·4] vs 0·8 g [0·2] per day, p<0·001). Total cardiac end points were significantly fewer in the intervention group than the controls (39 vs 76 events, p<0·001). Sudden cardiac deaths were also reduced (6 vs 16, p=0·015), as were non-fatal myocardial infarctions (21 vs 43, p<0·001). We noted a significant reduction in serum cholesterol concentration and other risk factors in both groups, but especially in the intervention diet group. In the treatment group, patients with pre-existing CAD had significantly greater benefits compared with such patients in the control group.

Interpretation

An Indo-Mediterranean diet that is rich in a-linolenic acid might be more effective in primary and secondary prevention of CAD than the conventional step I NCEP prudent diet.},

I dagboken (originalet p{\r{a}} latin) kan man l{\"{a}}sa f{\"{o}}r den 17 maj: »Kom jag till Upsala, d{\r{a}} hela min betj{\"{a}}ning l{\"{a}}mnade mig p{\r{a}} v{\"{a}}gen fr{\r{a}}n Flottsund, s{\r{a}} att jag skymfligen till fots i folkets {\r{a}}syn n{\"{o}}dgades g{\r{a}} in i staden.« Den 18 maj, dagen f{\"{o}}re det att Erik skulle f{\"{o}}redra sina anklagelser mot de f{\"{a}}ngslade f{\"{o}}r st{\"{a}}nderna, blev han berusad under banketten. Han skriver dagen d{\"{a}}rp{\r{a}}: »Fyllde n{\r{a}}gra g{\"{a}}ster mig med starkt vin emot deras och min egen vana.« N{\"{a}}r sedan talet skulle h{\r{a}}llas var konceptet borttappat, enligt Erik p{\r{a}} grund av en tj{\"{a}}nares »trol{\"{o}}shet«. Han b{\"{o}}rjade {\"{a}}nd{\r{a}} sitt anf{\"{o}}rande, men kom av sig d{\r{a}} han tyckte sig m{\"{a}}rka ett visst motst{\r{a}}nd bland pr{\"{a}}sterna. D{\"{a}}rf{\"{o}}r l{\"{a}}t han avbryta m{\"{o}}tet. Det var sedan Eriks f{\"{o}}rtrogne, hans prokurator, J{\"{o}}ran Persson, som slutf{\"{o}}rde f{\"{o}}rhandlingarna med st{\"{a}}nderna och fick dem att tillstyrka anklagelserna.

Under de f{\"{o}}ljande majdagarna br{\"{o}}t psykosen ut med full styrka. I dagboken finns ett uppeh{\r{a}}ll mellan 19 maj och 6 juli. Men av andra dokument vet vi att Erik befann sig i stark sp{\"{a}}nning och flydde slottsomr{\r{a}}det, d{\"{a}}r avr{\"{a}}ttningarna b{\"{o}}rjat. Hans gamle l{\"{a}}rare Dionysius Beurreus, en fransk hugenott och l{\"{a}}kare, s{\"{o}}kte lugnande {\"{o}}vertala honom att stoppa blodbadet, men blev sj{\"{a}}lv p{\r{a}} kungens befallning nedstucken. Erik skall sedan ha irrat omkring under drygt ett dygn tills han p{\r{a}}tr{\"{a}}ffades omt{\"{o}}cknad en bit utanf{\"{o}}r Uppsala.

Ända fram till {\r{a}}rsskiftet var han of{\"{o}}rm{\"{o}}gen att regera. Han uppvisade en rik och fluktuerande symtomflora med paranoida vanf{\"{o}}rest{\"{a}}llningar, {\r{a}}nger samt f{\"{o}}rtvivlan {\"{o}}ver vad han st{\"{a}}llt till med, varf{\"{o}}r han ville f{\"{o}}rsonas med de m{\"{o}}rdades anf{\"{o}}rvanter. Vidare trodde han sig tidvis vara avsatt och satt i f{\"{a}}ngelse, trots att han alltj{\"{a}}mt, {\r{a}}tminstone formellt, var en kung som regerade med Guds n{\r{a}}de. Den starka {\r{a}}ngest han k{\"{a}}nde framg{\r{a}}r av ett brev han skrev till sin bror Johan, med vilken han p{\r{a}} riksr{\r{a}}dets uppmaning (det var detta som nu hade den reella makten) s{\"{o}}kte f{\"{o}}rlikning: »Wi kunne icke annat wete, {\"{a}}n at Wi af alle m{\"{a}}nniskor {\"{o}}vergifne {\"{a}}re och i fast st{\"{o}}rre j{\"{a}}mmer stadde {\"{a}}n om Wi uti f{\"{a}}ngelse voro, medan Wi orsaken til W{\r{a}}rt f{\"{o}}rderf och olycka r{\"{a}}tsligen icke wete.« En av kungens sekreterare ber{\"{a}}ttar att »mod, hj{\"{a}}rta och all god lycka var f{\"{o}}rsvunnen, Guds dom och hans eget samvete be{\"{a}}ngslade honom«.

N{\"{a}}r v{\"{a}}l Erik tillfrisknade vid {\r{a}}rsskiftet, skedde det n{\"{a}}stan fr{\r{a}}n ena dagen till den andra. Han kunde {\r{a}}ter med full styrka leda styret av landet och ta bef{\"{a}}l {\"{o}}ver trupperna i kriget mot Danmark som p{\r{a}}gick. Under v{\r{a}}ren och sommaren 1568 s{\"{o}}kte han p{\r{a}} nytt flytta fram sina positioner mot h{\"{o}}gadeln. Kulmen var n{\"{a}}r han i juli officiellt l{\"{a}}t sig vigas vid den l{\r{a}}gb{\"{o}}rdiga Karin M{\r{a}}nsdotter, som ocks{\r{a}} kr{\"{o}}ntes till drottning. D{\"{a}}rigenom distanserade han sig fullst{\"{a}}ndigt fr{\r{a}}n h{\"{o}}gadeln, som av h{\"{a}}vd v{\"{a}}ntade sig att en drottning skulle v{\"{a}}ljas ur deras krets. Allt detta kom att besegla hans {\"{o}}de. Halvbr{\"{o}}derna, hertigarna Johan och Karl, reste upprorsfanan. Styrkef{\"{o}}rh{\r{a}}llandena var till Eriks nackdel; i september tvangs han ge sig sj{\"{a}}lv f{\r{a}}ngen {\r{a}}t sina br{\"{o}}der. S{\r{a}} f{\"{o}}rblev han {\"{a}}nda tills han 1577 m{\"{o}}rdades med arsenik p{\r{a}} slottet {\"{O}}rbyhus, av allt att d{\"{o}}ma p{\r{a}} Johan III:s befallning.

Det gick ingen materiell n{\"{o}}d p{\r{a}} honom, men f{\r{a}}ngenskapen ledde till {\"{o}}kande isolering, s{\"{a}}rskilt efter det att han 1573 skilts fr{\r{a}}n sin Karin p{\r{a}} kung Johans befallning. F{\"{o}}rh{\r{a}}llandet till henne var dock problematiskt; ofta br{\"{o}}t Eriks svartsjuka s{\"{a}}mjan. Vid ett tillf{\"{a}}lle blev han ocks{\r{a}} sv{\r{a}}rt misshandlad av en vakt, bror till en av de i Uppsala m{\"{o}}rdade adelsm{\"{a}}nnen. Erik fick l{\"{a}}sa, men hade inte tillg{\r{a}}ng till skrivpapper. I b{\"{o}}cker som han studerade gjorde han anteckningar. Mot slutet ber{\"{o}}vades han ocks{\r{a}} skrivdon; ist{\"{a}}llet sotade han en tr{\"{a}}sticka att anv{\"{a}}ndas som penna. Dessa anteckningar {\"{a}}r v{\r{a}}r fr{\"{a}}msta information om hur han m{\r{a}}dde. I {\"{o}}vrigt {\"{a}}r samtida vittnen mots{\"{a}}gelsefulla. F{\r{a}} hade av naturliga sk{\"{a}}l m{\"{o}}jligheter att direkt observera den f{\r{a}}ngne kungen. Det finns inte n{\r{a}}gra s{\"{a}}kra bel{\"{a}}gg f{\"{o}}r sinnessjukdom i b{\"{o}}rjan av f{\r{a}}ngenskapen, men 1575 ber{\"{a}}ttar ett vittne om Erik att han »steller sig understundom som en rasande meniskie«.

De efterl{\"{a}}mnade anteckningarna fr{\r{a}}n f{\"{a}}ngelsetiden best{\r{a}}r av teckningar, noter till musikstycken, dagb{\"{o}}cker samt olika texter, s{\r{a}}som traktater d{\"{a}}r Erik enligt den aristoteliska logikens principer g{\"{o}}r slutledningar, syllogismer, varav merparten uttrycker hans {\"{o}}nskan att r{\"{a}}ttf{\"{a}}rdiga sig sj{\"{a}}lv och genom att argumentera f{\"{o}}r arvrikets f{\"{o}}rdelar framh{\r{a}}lla vilket oerh{\"{o}}rt brott han sj{\"{a}}lv blivit utsatt f{\"{o}}r genom br{\"{o}}dernas f{\"{o}}rr{\"{a}}deri. Dessutom finns genealogiska h{\"{a}}rledningar, som med b{\"{o}}rjan i Adam och Eva {\"{o}}ver guden Jupiter osv slutar med honom sj{\"{a}}lv, samt l{\r{a}}nga namnl{\"{a}}ngder, d{\"{a}}r bara en del av namnen kan knytas till identifierbara gestalter. Man har tolkat de senare s{\r{a}}, att kungen i sin f{\r{a}}ngenskap gick in i en kompensatorisk fantasiv{\"{a}}rld d{\"{a}}r han delade ut f{\"{o}}rl{\"{a}}ningar {\r{a}}t imagin{\"{a}}ra befattningshavare.

Hur har man bed{\"{o}}mt Eriks sinnessjukdom? Vi kan b{\"{o}}rja med honom sj{\"{a}}lv. I februari 1568 kommenterade han sin nyss genomlidna psykos i ett brev till {\"{a}}rkebiskopen. Han ber{\"{a}}ttar att Gud hj{\"{a}}lpt honom »ifr{\r{a}}n dj{\"{a}}vulens anf{\"{a}}ktning, som oss besv{\"{a}}rat haver«. Liknande tankeg{\r{a}}ngar kommer till uttryck i en offentlig f{\"{o}}rklaring som han l{\"{a}}t adressera till folket att l{\"{a}}sas upp fr{\r{a}}n predikstolarna i juli samma {\r{a}}r.

Att det {\"{a}}r segrarna som skriver historien {\"{a}}r en sanning som i h{\"{o}}g grad bekr{\"{a}}ftas n{\"{a}}r det g{\"{a}}ller Erik XIV. Om nu han sj{\"{a}}lv uppfattade sin sjukdom som en anf{\"{a}}ktning av dj{\"{a}}vulen, vilken Gud hj{\"{a}}lpt honom att st{\r{a}} emot, betraktade i st{\"{a}}llet usurpatorn Johan III och hans anh{\"{a}}ngare den som ett Guds straff i det anklagelsedokument som st{\"{a}}nderna hade att ta st{\"{a}}llning till 1569 efter Eriks avs{\"{a}}ttning. Äldre historiker har i allm{\"{a}}nhet varit kritiska mot Erik. Sinnessjukdomen och {\"{o}}vriga f{\"{o}}rment d{\r{a}}liga karakt{\"{a}}rsdrag har givit stoff {\r{a}}t en m{\"{o}}rk personteckning. Man har s{\"{a}}rskilt framh{\r{a}}llit lynnigheten, liderligheten, obeslutsamheten, h{\"{o}}gdragenheten och hans {\"{o}}verdrivna misst{\"{a}}nksamhet. Vidare har hans n{\"{a}}stan monomana intresse f{\"{o}}r astrologi (tidens modevetenskap) uppfattats som graverande. I den m{\r{a}}n {\"{a}}ldre historiker ocks{\r{a}} velat se en {\"{a}}rftlig belastning, har man pekat p{\r{a}} m{\"{o}}dernet. Erik var ju ende sonen i Gustav Vasas f{\"{o}}rsta {\"{a}}ktenskap, det med Katarina av Sachsen-Lauenburg. P{\r{a}} s{\r{a}} s{\"{a}}tt gick naturligtvis de yngre syskonen fria – de hade Gustav Vasas andra gem{\r{a}}l, Margareta Leijonhufvud, till mor – fr{\r{a}}n misstankarna om att ha burit p{\r{a}} d{\r{a}}liga arvsanlag. Anklagelserna mot de f{\"{a}}ngslade adelsm{\"{a}}nnen i Uppsala, som ledde fram till Sturemorden, har setts som frukter av Eriks sjukliga misstankar i kombination med J{\"{o}}ran Perssons onda anslag.

Egentligen finns det bara en {\"{a}}ldre auktoritet som s{\"{o}}kte g{\"{o}}ra en mer balanserad och psykologisk bed{\"{o}}mning av Erik, n{\"{a}}mligen 1700-talshistorikern Olof Celsius. Denne betonade vad vi skulle kalla reaktiva faktorer och framh{\"{o}}ll Eriks tr{\"{a}}ngda l{\"{a}}ge. Han menade att ryktena om alla st{\"{a}}mplingar mot honom bidrog till hans fullt begripliga misst{\"{a}}nksamhet.

Ett av de tidigaste f{\"{o}}rs{\"{o}}ken till en preciserad psykiatrisk diagnostik finner man i historikern A G Ahlqvists bok »Konung Erik XIV:s sista lefnads{\r{a}}r« fr{\r{a}}n 1878. Han hade konsulterat Uppsalaprofessorn i psykiatri N G Kjellberg, som menade att Eriks sjukdom var av en »maniakalisk natur, dvs periodiskt {\r{a}}terkommande med ljusare mellantider«.

Med Viktor Wigerts »Erik XIV« fr{\r{a}}n 1920 till{\"{a}}mpades f{\"{o}}r f{\"{o}}rsta g{\r{a}}ngen den moderna psykiatrins diagnostiska ramverk p{\r{a}} en analys av Erik. Slutsatsen som f{\"{o}}rfattaren – sedermera professor i psykiatri vid Karolinska institutet – kom till var att det r{\"{o}}rde sig om en schizofren psykos med en demens som slutstadium, dvs det som impliceras i den tyske psykiatern Emil Kraepelins begrepp: dementia praecox. Eller som Wigert f{\"{o}}rklarar: » ... en fortskridande organisk process, som till slut {\r{a}}stadkommit en betydande destruktion av substratet f{\"{o}}r de psykiska f{\"{o}}rm{\"{o}}genheterna.« Till skillnad fr{\r{a}}n {\"{a}}ldre historiker menade Wigert att det inte var p{\r{a}} m{\"{o}}dernet utan p{\r{a}} f{\"{a}}dernet de sjukdomsalstrande generna fanns. Det {\"{a}}r ju ett sl{\r{a}}ende faktum att bland Eriks halvsyskon blev hertig Magnus alltmer invalidiserad av sinnessjukdom, och {\"{a}}ven systern Sofia drabbades av psykisk oh{\"{a}}lsa. Wigert gav Magnus samma diagnos som Erik. {\"{O}}verhuvud fanns det en anhopning av psykisk sjukdom, olyckliga och avvikande personlighetsdrag inom Vasa{\"{a}}tten – inte minst lynnigheten samt misst{\"{a}}nksamheten.

Wigerts studie {\"{a}}r imponerande; den bygger p{\r{a}} omfattande k{\"{a}}llforskning. Änd{\r{a}} utg{\r{a}}r den i sitt grundkoncept fr{\r{a}}n den m{\"{o}}rka bild av Erik som {\"{a}}ldre historiker m{\r{a}}lat. Uppfattningen om en kronisk endogen sinnesjukdom {\"{a}}r ett slags medikalisering av denna bild. Wigert {\"{a}}r ofta ensidig n{\"{a}}r han tolkar enskilda episoder som exempel p{\r{a}} Eriks sjukliga misst{\"{a}}nksamhet utan att se dem i deras historiska sammanhang. Han tog ocks{\r{a}} st{\"{a}}llning i fr{\r{a}}gan om dateringen av vissa anteckningar fr{\r{a}}n f{\"{a}}ngelsetiden s{\r{a}} att de passade med hans teori om en successiv demensutveckling. De st{\"{a}}mplingar som Erik trodde riktades mot honom var enligt Wigert paranoida vanf{\"{o}}rest{\"{a}}llningar. F{\"{o}}ljaktligen s{\r{a}}g han ocks{\r{a}} skuldfr{\r{a}}gan ang{\r{a}}ende Sturemorden i ett psykiatriskt perspektiv.

Under 1900-talet blev bilden av Erik XIV mindre entydig. 1927 publicerade historikern och etnologen Rudolf Elander »Sturemordens g{\r{a}}ta«, d{\"{a}}r han argumenterade f{\"{o}}r att Eriks anklagelser mot h{\"{o}}gadeln f{\"{o}}r st{\"{a}}mplingar var h{\"{o}}gst befogade; en uppfattning som han sedan f{\"{o}}rde fram i andra studier. 1996 drev journalisten och f{\"{o}}rfattaren Knut Carlqvist, om {\"{a}}n mer tendenti{\"{o}}st, en liknande tes i »Kung Erik av folket«.

Det tyngsta inslaget i den f{\"{o}}ljande historiska revisionen {\"{a}}r Ingvar Anderssons biografi {\"{o}}ver Erik XIV fr{\r{a}}n 1935. Andersson, som var en str{\"{a}}ng k{\"{a}}llkritiker, menade att dokumentationen betr{\"{a}}ffande Sturemorden inte gav st{\"{o}}d f{\"{o}}r en best{\"{a}}md uppfattning i skuldfr{\r{a}}gan. Han framh{\"{o}}ll emellertid de rationella sidorna hos Erik. F{\"{o}}r honom var kungen ett barn av ren{\"{a}}ssansen som i Machiavellis anda str{\"{a}}vade efter att st{\"{a}}rka furstemakten. Sturemorden m{\r{a}}ste ses i detta sammanhang. Till skillnad fr{\r{a}}n Wigert ans{\r{a}}g Andersson att Eriks psykiska sjukdomshistoria kan avgr{\"{a}}nsas till tv{\r{a}} perioder: den som f{\"{o}}ljde p{\r{a}} Sturemorden och den som br{\"{o}}t ut under de sista f{\"{a}}ngelse{\r{a}}ren. D{\"{a}}rmed fann han inte bel{\"{a}}gg f{\"{o}}r att sjukdomen var av en kroniskt progressiv natur.

Ingvar Anderssons biografi spelade en viktig roll f{\"{o}}r professorn i neurologi, Nils Antoni, n{\"{a}}r han ifr{\r{a}}gasatte schizofrenidiagnosen i en uppsats 1964. I st{\"{a}}llet menade han att det r{\"{o}}rde sig om avgr{\"{a}}nsade reaktiva psykoser, betingade av Eriks utsatta st{\"{a}}llning 1567 och den tilltagande isoleringen under de sista f{\"{a}}ngelse{\r{a}}ren. En bidragande faktor var ocks{\r{a}} en personlighetsm{\"{a}}ssig sk{\"{o}}rhet, eller psykopati, som grundade sig i en partiell omogenhet. Antoni karakt{\"{a}}riserade Erik som hypertym, dvs emotionellt labil med starka sensitiva drag.

Historieprofessorn Lars-Olof Larsson {\"{a}}r i »Arvet efter Gustav Vasa« fr{\r{a}}n 2005 av den uppfattningen att de historiska k{\"{a}}llorna inte ger n{\r{a}}got st{\"{o}}d f{\"{o}}r en h{\"{o}}gadlig konspiration mot Erik vid tiden f{\"{o}}r Sturemorden. Han menar vidare att Ingvar Andersson tog f{\"{o}}r l{\"{a}}tt p{\r{a}} de uppgifter som kan tolkas s{\r{a}} att Erik {\"{a}}ven visade en del sjukdomssymtom f{\"{o}}re Sturemorden. I {\"{o}}vrigt g{\r{a}}r inte Larsson in p{\r{a}} Eriks diagnos.

G{\r{a}}r det att forts{\"{a}}tta resonemangen om Erik XIV:s sinnesjukdom? Ja, till skillnad fr{\r{a}}n Wigert har vi idag ett diagnostiskt alternativ som griper {\"{o}}ver p{\r{a}} b{\r{a}}de den schizofrena och den affektiva sidan, n{\"{a}}mligen schizoaffektiv psykos. En synonym {\"{a}}r cykloid psykos. Det r{\"{o}}r sig om en sjukdomsgrupp som vanligen har ett periodiskt f{\"{o}}rlopp och som karakt{\"{a}}riseras av s{\r{a}}v{\"{a}}l st{\"{a}}mningsf{\"{o}}rskjutningar som en schizofreniform symtomflora. Även f{\"{o}}rvirringstillst{\r{a}}nd och starka reaktiva inslag brukar finnas vid de psykotiska utbrotten, som oftast har en stormande och akut karakt{\"{a}}r. 1987 h{\"{a}}vdade psykiatern Greta Runnquist-Olsson i en studie att en s{\r{a}}dan diagnos var t{\"{a}}nkbar f{\"{o}}r halvbrodern Magnus del. Man kan f{\"{o}}lja vidare i hennes sp{\r{a}}r och ocks{\r{a}} pr{\"{o}}va diagnosen p{\r{a}} Erik. D{\"{a}}rmed {\"{a}}r vi tillbaka till 1800-talspsykiatern Kjellbergs ovann{\"{a}}mnda karakt{\"{a}}ristik av Eriks sjukdom som »maniakalisk«. N{\r{a}}gon definitiv slutsats g{\r{a}}r dock inte att dra. De metodologiska sv{\r{a}}righeterna {\"{a}}r f{\"{o}}r stora. Den typ av kriteriebaserad psykiatrisk diagnostik som vi idag g{\"{a}}rna anv{\"{a}}nder {\"{a}}r f{\"{o}}r precis och rigid f{\"{o}}r att kunna till{\"{a}}mpas p{\r{a}} ett historiskt material som inte {\"{a}}r fokuserat kring dessa kriterier.

F{\"{o}}r att avslutningsvis l{\"{a}}mna fr{\r{a}}gan om en l{\"{a}}mplig diagnos {\r{a}}t sidan och ist{\"{a}}llet f{\"{o}}rs{\"{o}}ka n{\r{a}} fram till en mer tidl{\"{o}}s insikt om psykisk sjukdom och hur maktl{\"{o}}s {\"{a}}ven en kung av Guds n{\r{a}}de {\"{a}}r, n{\"{a}}r han drabbas, kan vi begrunda en av Eriks syllogismer: »Gud befaller, att man skall ha f{\"{o}}rdrag med m{\"{a}}nniskornas svagheter p{\r{a}} grund av sinnessjukdom. Konungar {\"{a}}r ocks{\r{a}} m{\"{a}}nniskor och kunna bliva sinnessjuka. D{\"{a}}rf{\"{o}}r b{\"{o}}r man ocks{\r{a}} ha f{\"{o}}rdrag med konungarnas svaghet och sinnessjukdom.«},

  abstract      = {The decreasing trends in fertility rates in many industrialized countries are now so dramatic that they deserve much more scientific attention. Although social and behavioural factors undoubtedly play a major role for these trends, it seems premature, and not based on solid information, to conclude that these trends can be ascribed to social and behavioural changes alone. There is evi- dence to suspect that changing lifestyle and increasing environmental expo- sures, e.g. to endocrine disrupters, are behind the trends in occurrence of male reproductive health problems, including testis cancer, undescended testis and poor semen quality. These biological factors may also contribute to the extre- mely low fertility rates. However, the necessary research is complex and requires non-traditional collaboration between demographers, epidemiologists, clinicians, biologists, wild life researchers, geneticists and molecular biologists. This research effort can hardly be carried out without major support from gov- ernments and granting agencies making it possible to fund collaborative pro- jects within novel research networks of scientists.},

  abstract      = {It is predicted that Japan and European Union will soon experience appreciable decreases in their populations due to persistently low total fertility rates (TFR) below replacement level (2.1 child per woman). In the United States, where TFR has also declined, there are ethnic differences. Caucasians have rates below replacement, while TFRs among African-Americans and Hispanics are higher. We review possible links between TFR and trends in a range of male reproductive problems, including testicular cancer, disorders of sex development, cryptorchidism, hypospadias, low testosterone levels, poor semen quality, childlessness, changed sex ratio, and increasing demand for assisted reproductive techniques. We present evidence that several adult male reproductive problems arise in utero and are signs of testicular dysgenesis syndrome (TDS). Although TDS might result from genetic mutations, recent evidence suggests that it most often is related to environmental exposures of the fetal testis. However, environmental factors can also affect the adult endocrine system. Based on our review of genetic and environmental factors, we conclude that environmental exposures arising from modern lifestyle, rather than genetics, are the most important factors in the observed trends. These environmental factors might act either directly or via epigenetic mechanisms. In the latter case, the effects of exposures might have an impact for several generations post-exposure. In conclusion, there is an urgent need to prioritize research in reproductive physiology and pathophysiology, particularly in highly industrialized countries facing decreasing populations. We highlight a number of topics that need attention by researchers in human physiology, pathophysiology, environmental health sciences, and demography.},

Polluted storm water from a metal recycling industry has been filtrated through columns that contained two different adsorbents, peat and pine bark. Peat is an organic soil, mainly used for energy production, and pine bark, a by-product from the forest industry. In Sweden, there are a lot of resources of peat as well as pine bark. Used as filter materials, they are relatively cheep and, like other kinds of filtermaterial used as adsorbents, they have varied capacity to adsorb metals in water. The capacity for the filter materials to adsorb metals depends on the physical structure and chemical contents of the peat and pine bark as well as the water metal composition. Results from this study show that pine bark had the highest adsorption capacity to reduce copper, lead and zinc from the specific storm water.},

  abstract      = {IMPORTANCE Millions of women worldwide use hormonal contraception. Despite the clinical
evidence of an influence of hormonal contraception on some women’s mood, associations
between the use of hormonal contraception and mood disturbances remain inadequately
addressed.
OBJECTIVE To investigate whether the use of hormonal contraception is positively associated
with subsequent use of antidepressants and a diagnosis of depression at a psychiatric
hospital.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This nationwide prospective cohort study combined
data from the National Prescription Register and the Psychiatric Central Research Register in
Denmark. All women and adolescents aged 15 to 34 years who were living in Denmark were
followed up from January 1, 2000, to December 2013, if they had no prior depression
diagnosis, redeemed prescription for antidepressants, other major psychiatric diagnosis,
cancer, venous thrombosis, or infertility treatment. Data were collected from January 1, 1995,
to December 31, 2013, and analyzed from January 1, 2015, through April 1, 2016.
EXPOSURES Use of different types of hormonal contraception.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES With time-varying covariates, adjusted incidence rate ratios
(RRs) were calculated for first use of an antidepressant and first diagnosis of depression at a
psychiatric hospital.
RESULTS A total of 1 061 997 women (mean [SD] age, 24.4 [0.001] years; mean [SD]
follow-up, 6.4 [0.004] years) were included in the analysis. Compared with nonusers, users
of combined oral contraceptives had an RR of first use of an antidepressant of 1.23 (95% CI,
1.22-1.25). Users of progestogen-only pills had an RR for first use of an antidepressant of 1.34
(95% CI, 1.27-1.40); users of a patch (norgestrolmin), 2.0 (95% CI, 1.76-2.18); users of a vaginal
ring (etonogestrel), 1.6 (95% CI, 1.55-1.69); and users of a levonorgestrel intrauterine system,
1.4 (95% CI, 1.31-1.42). For depression diagnoses, similar or slightly lower estimates were
found. The relative risks generally decreased with increasing age. Adolescents (age range,
15-19 years) using combined oral contraceptives had an RR of a first use of an antidepressant
of 1.8 (95% CI, 1.75-1.84) and those using progestin-only pills, 2.2 (95% CI, 1.99-2.52). Six
months after starting use of hormonal contraceptives, the RR of antidepressant use peaked at
1.4 (95% CI, 1.34-1.46). When the reference group was changed to those who never used
hormonal contraception, the RR estimates for users of combined oral contraceptives
increased to 1.7 (95% CI, 1.66-1.71).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Use of hormonal contraception, especially among adolescents,
was associated with subsequent use of antidepressants and a first diagnosis of depression,
suggesting depression as a potential adverse effect of hormonal contraceptive use.},

This deficit is believed to result from competition between the two targets for limited attentional resources. Here we show, using performance in an attentional-blink task and scalp-recorded brain potentials, that meditation, or mental training, affects the distribution of limited brain resources. Three months of intensive mental training resulted in a smaller attentional blink and reduced brain-resource allocation to the first target, as reflected by a smaller T1-elicited P3b, a brain-potential index of resource allocation. Furthermore, those individuals that showed the largest decrease in brain-resource allocation to T1 generally showed the greatest reduction in attentional-blink size. These observations provide novel support for the view that the ability to accurately identify T2 depends upon the efficient deployment of resources to T1. The results also demonstrate that mental training can result in increased control over the distribution of limited brain resources. Our study supports the idea that plasticity in brain and mental function exists throughout life and illustrates the usefulness of systematic mental training in the study of the human mind.},

Questionnaires were administered to 353 primary school students assessing various dimensions of peer relations and depression. As predicted the tendency to be victimized was found to be significantly associated with depression. Interestingly there was also a significant association between depression and the tendency to bully.

Putting on formal clothing induced greater category inclusiveness (Study 3) and enhanced a global processing advantage (Study 4). The association between clothing formality and abstract processing was mediated by felt power (Study 5). The findings demonstrate that the nature of an everyday and ecologically valid experience, the clothing worn, influences cognition broadly, impacting the processing style that changes how objects, people, and events are construed.},

We consider the relative likelihood of complete global sterilisation events from three astrophysical sources â supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, large asteroid impacts, and passing-by stars. To assess such probabilities we consider what cataclysmic event could lead to the annihilation of not just human life, but also extremophiles, through the boiling of all water in Earthâs oceans. Surprisingly we find that although human life is somewhat fragile to nearby events, the resilience of Ecdysozoa such as Milnesium tardigradum renders global sterilisation an unlikely event.},

Males and females selected as high or low habitual caffeine users were randomly assigned to receive either caffeine or a placebo and exposed to novel and repetitive recall tasks and to simple auditory stimuli. Electrodermal activity and recall task performance were recorded. The four major factors examined, including habitual caffeine use, acute ingestion, gender, and stimulus novelty, affected behavior, physiology, or both. Results showed that habitual caffeine usage systematically affected tonic arousal (skin conductance level) and improved recall task performance. Acute caffeine ingestion increased phasic arousal (skin conductance response amplitude) and reduced habituation rates. Gender interacted with other factors to significantly affect both tonic and phasic arousal, and females performed better than males on the recall tasks. These results were partially supportive of the theoretical model, and further work is needed to examine the interactions of acute and chronic caffeine intake with gender and novelty. },

  abstract      = {Since the late Pleistocene, large-bodied mammals have been extirpated from much of
Earth. Although all habitable continents once harbored giant mammals, the few remaining
species are largely confined to Africa. This decline is coincident with the global expansion
of hominins over the late Quaternary. Here, we quantify mammalian extinction selectivity,
continental body size distributions, and taxonomic diversity over five time periods
spanning the past 125,000 years and stretching approximately 200 years into the future.
We demonstrate that size-selective extinction was already under way in the oldest interval
and occurred on all continents, within all trophic modes, and across all time intervals.
Moreover, the degree of selectivity was unprecedented in 65 million years of mammalian

Results We were unable to identify any randomised controlled trials of parachute intervention. Conclusions As with many interventions intended to prevent ill health, the effectiveness of parachutes has not been subjected to rigorous evaluation by using randomised controlled trials. Advocates of evidence based medicine have criticised the adoption of interventions evaluated by using only observational data. We think that everyone might benefit if the most radical protagonists of evidence based medicine organised and participated in a double blind, randomised, placebo controlled, crossover trial of the parachute.},

Seventeen feeding events were observed during the cooler months between July and September in relatively shallow coastal waters, with 12 dolphins identified as adult females. We observed behavioural sequences of complex prey-handling of cuttlefish where dolphinsâ used multiple steps to remove the cuttlefish head, ink and cuttlebone before consuming the flesh of the cuttlefish mantle. Our study provides valuable information to the limited knowledge on the complex prey-handling by T. aduncus on cuttlefish in Australia, and is complementary to other known specialised foraging behaviours of bottlenose dolphins. This study also details a different behavioural sequence of cuttlefish prey-handling to that of the bottlenose dolphins in the Sado estuary, Portugal, where only the head is consumed, and to the Spencer Gulf, Australia, in that the dolphins in Bunbury carry the cuttlefish mantle over their rostrum before removing the cuttlebone. Information on S. apama in Bunbury is scarce, therefore studies on abundance, distribution and egg-laying sites are recommended in order to enable informed decision making and to understand the importance of S. apama to the diet of T. aduncus.},

  abstract      = {Heterocyclic amines (HCAs) are a class of toxicological compounds that can be formed during heating of precursors, amino acids, creatinine, creatine, and sugars at high temperature cooking of muscle products. These potent mutagens are suspected to play a role in human cancers. The objective of this study was to investigate a practical method to reduce the amount of HCAs through marinating of beef steaks. We were interested in the potential health benefits of natural extracts containing polyphenols present in commercial marinades. HCAs were compared in marinated and unmarinated steaks. Four common HCAs were investigated: 2-amino-3,8- dimethyl-imidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenyl-imidazo[4,5- b]pyridine (PhIP), 1-methyl-9H-pyrido[4,3-b]-indol (harman), and 9H-pyrido[4,3-b]-indol (norharman). Steaks were marinated for one hour and grilled at 400 °F for 5 minutes at each side. Meat samples were extracted by solid phase extraction (SPE) and analysis with HPLC showed the significant decrease (p < 0.05) of sum of polar and nonpolar HCAs by 71% compared to untreated steaks. For confirmation of spices potency on reduction of HCA formation, the same experiment was applied to meat with the base of commercial marinade powders excluding the herbs and spices. Lesser reduction of HCAs were shown and in some cases no significant reduction occurred. HPLC analysis showed presence of considerable amount of natural phenolic antioxidants of carnosic acid, carnosol, and rosmarinic acid, which can be related to the reduction effects of HCA formation in commercial marinades. These results revealed that marinating meats before grilling with various spices/herbs containing antioxidants may reduce formation of mutagenic /carcinogenic HCAs markedly.},

  abstract      = {Summary The purpose of this investigation was to identify ways to prompt retrieval practice to make recall even more effective at producing meaningful learning. In two experiments, subjects read educational texts and practiced retrieval across two periods. During prompted retrieval, subjects were cued to explain and describe concepts from the text, whereas during free recall, subjects recalled as much of the material from the text as they could. A reading control condition was also included. Learning was assessed using both verbatim and higherâorder questions 1âweek later. Practicing retrieval improved learning relative to the control on both types of questions; however, whether subjects practiced free or prompted retrieval did not matter for learning. Subjects rated prompted retrieval as less enjoyable and interesting than the other retrieval conditions. Results demonstrate practicing retrieval promoted meaningful learning, and that subjects' initial retrieval success was highest when they used their own retrieval strategies during recall.

  abstract      = { Retrieval practice improves meaningful learning, and the most frequent way of implementing retrieval practice in classrooms is to have students answer questions. In four experiments (N=372) we investigated the effects of different question formats on learning. Students read educational texts and practised retrieval by answering short-answer, multiple-choice, or hybrid questions. In hybrid conditions students first attempted to recall answers in short-answer format, then identified answers in multiple-choice format. We measured learning 1 week later using a final assessment with two types of questions: those that could be answered by recalling information verbatim from the texts and those that required inferences. Practising retrieval in all format conditions enhanced retention, relative to a study-only control condition, on both verbatim and inference questions. However, there were little or no advantages of answering short-answer or hybrid format questions over multiple-choice questions in three experiments. In Experiment 4, when retrieval success was improved under initial short-answer conditions, there was an advantage of answering short-answer or hybrid questions over multiple-choice questions. The results challenge the simple conclusion that short-answer questions always produce the best learning, due to increased retrieval effort or difficulty, and demonstrate the importance of retrieval success for retrieval-based learning activities. },

Smits et al. found that the microbiota of these people reflects the seasonal availability of different types of food (see the Perspective by Peddada). Between seasons, striking differences were observed in their gut microbial communities, with some taxa apparently disappearing, only to reappear when the seasons turned. Further comparison of the Hadza microbiota with that of diverse urbanized peoples revealed distinctly different patterns of microbial community composition.Science, this issue p. 802; see also p. 754Although humans have cospeciated with their gut-resident microbes, it is difficult to infer features of our ancestral microbiome. Here, we examine the microbiome profile of 350 stool samples collected longitudinally for more than a year from the Hadza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania. The data reveal annual cyclic reconfiguration of the microbiome, in which some taxa become undetectable only to reappear in a subsequent season. Comparison of the Hadza data set with data collected from 18 populations in 16 countries with varying lifestyles reveals that gut community membership corresponds to modernization: Notably, the taxa within the Hadza that are the most seasonally volatile similarly differentiate industrialized and traditional populations. These data indicate that some dynamic lineages of microbes have decreased in prevalence and abundance in modernized populations.},

Several cognitive theories have been proposed to explain this superiority, but only recently have data begun to delineate the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of spaced training, and we review these theories and data here. Computational models of the implicated signalling cascades have predicted that spaced training with irregular inter-trial intervals can enhance learning. This strategy of using models to predict optimal spaced training protocols, combined with pharmacotherapy, suggests novel ways to rescue impaired synaptic plasticity and learning.},

Students in our introductory biology course performed significantly better if they engaged in PLTL. There was also a drastic reduction in the failure rate for underrepresented minority (URM) students with PLTL, which further resulted in closing the achievement gap between URM and non-URM students. With such compelling findings, we strongly encourage the adoption of Peer-Led Team Learning in undergraduate Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) courses.},

  abstract      = {The key aim of the present research was to study the functionality of two global variables in the Olweus Bully/Victim Questionnaire and to examine the appropriateness of different cutoff points of these variables for prevalence estimation. Several empirical and conceptual analyses strongly attested to the functionality of the two selected variables in terms of construct validity and selected measurement properties. Similarly, a number of analyses indicated that (having been bullied/having bullied other students) 2 or 3 times a month was a reasonable and useful lower-bound cutoff point. With this cutoff point, involved students, victims, and bullies differed very markedly and in clearly different ways from non-involved students in conceptually related variables. Prevalence estimates derived in this way can be conveniently obtained, have a reasonably well-defined meaning, can be easily understood by users, and can be reproduced unambiguously by different researchers/administrators and at different times. An important background for the article is the fact that several common methods, including peer nominations, are not well suited for prevalence estimation. Prevalence data for victims, bullies, and bully-victims are also presented. All data were derived from the New Bergen Project Against Bullying, comprising a sample of 5,171 students from 37 schools in the town community of Bergen, Norway. At the time of the data collection, the spring of 1997, the 2,544 girls and 2,627 boys were in grades 5 through 9, with modal ages of 11 through 15 years.},

Objective: To investigate the relationship between TC, lipid-lowering drugs and cognitive functions in non-demented elderly. Design and Setting: Participants of the Cardiovascular risk factors, aging and dementia (CAIDE) study were derived from random, populationbased samples previously studied in 1972, 1977, 1982 or 1987. Analyses are based on 1382 non-demented participants re-examined in 1998 after an average follow-up of 21 years. Results: High midlife TC was associated with poorer late-life episodic memory and category fluency. TC decreased in most individuals over time. A more pronounced decrease was related to poorer late-life episodic memory and psychomotor speed, but not if subjects used statins. Conclusions: The TC–cognition relationship seems bidirectional. High midlife TC is associated with poorer late-life cognition, but decreasing TC after midlife may reflect poorer cognitive status. Statins may be beneficial for cognition in non-demented elderly. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Keywords: Statins; Midlife cholesterol; Changes in cholesterol; Cognition},

  abstract      = {Abstract Industrially produced chemicals have been a major environmental concern across our entire Globe since the onset of rapid industrial development around the early 1900. Many of the substances being used are known to be endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and are also known to be long-range dispersed and to biomagnify to very high concentrations in the tissues of Arctic apex predators such as polar bears (Ursus maritimus). A major concern relating to \{EDCs\} is their effects on vital organâtissues such as bone and it is possible that \{EDCs\} represent a more serious challenge to the species' survival than the more conventionally proposed prey reductions linked to climate change. We therefore analyzed penile bone mineral density (BMD) as a key phenotype for reproductive success in 279 polar bear samples born 1990â2000 representing eight polar bear subpopulations. Since \{EDC\} concentrations were not available from the same specimens, we compared \{BMD\} with published literature information on \{EDC\} concentrations. Latitudinal and longitudinal \{BMD\} and \{EDC\} gradients were clearly observed, with Western Hudson bears having the highest \{BMD\} and lowest EDCs, and North East Greenland polar bears carrying the lowest \{BMD\} and highest EDCs. A \{BMD\} vs. polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) regression analysis showed that \{BMD\} decreased as a function of the eight subpopulations' \{PCB\} concentrations and this relationship was close to being significant (p=0.10, R2=0.39). Risk quotient (RQ) estimation demonstrated that \{PCBs\} could be in a range that may lead to disruption of normal reproduction and development. It is therefore likely that \{EDCs\} directly affect development and bone density in polar bears. Canadian bears had in general the best health and the North East Greenland subpopulation being at the highest risk of having negative health effects. While reductions in \{BMD\} is in general unhealthy, reductions in penile \{BMD\} could lead to increased risk of species extinction because of mating and subsequent fertilization failure as a result of weak penile bones and risk of fractures. Based on this, future studies should assess how polar bear subpopulations respond upon \{EDC\} exposure since information and understanding about their circumpolar reproductive health is vital for future conservation.},

A traditional German acid curd cheese was ripened under defined conditions at elevated temperature, and protein and amino acid modifications were investigated. Degree of proteolysis and analysis of early [Amadori compound furosine (6)] and advanced [NÎµ-carboxymethyllysine (4), NÎµ-carboxyethyllysine (5)] Maillard reaction products confirmed the maturation to proceed from the rind to the core of the cheese. Whereas 6 was decreased, 4 and 5 increased over time. Deeper insight into the Maillard reaction during the ripening of cheese was achieved by the determination of selected Î±-dicarbonyl compounds. Especially methylglyoxal (2) showed a characteristic behavior during storage of the acid curd cheese. Decrease of this reactive structure was directly correlated to the formation of 5. To extend the results of experimental ripening to commercial cheeses, different aged Gouda types were investigated. Maturation times of the samples ranged from 6 to 8 weeks (young) to more than 1 year (aged). Again, increase of 5 and decrease of 2 were able to describe the ripening of this rennet coagulated cheese. Therefore, both chemical parameters are potent markers to characterize the degree of maturation, independent of coagulation. },

Fluid intakes are typically high in athletes who develop hyponatremia, although hyponatremia can occur with relatively modest fluid intakes. The development of fluid overload and hyponatremia in the presence of a modest fluid intake raises the possibility that athletes with this condition may have an impaired renal capacity to excrete a fluid load. The bulk of evidence favours fluid retention in the extracellular space (dilutional hyponatremia) rather than fluid remaining unabsorbed in the intestine. Female gender is an important risk factor for the development of hyponatremia. Management and prevention of exercise-associated hyponatremia are discussed.},

Revolution 2.0 is an uprising focused on how we should be doing science now (i.e., in a 2.0 world). The precipitating events of the revolution have already been well-documented: failures to replicate, questionable research practices, fraud, etc. And the fact that none of these events is new to our field has also been well-documented. I suggest four interconnected reasons as to why this time is different: changing technology, changing demographics of researchers, limited resources, and misaligned incentives. I then describe two reasons why the revolution is more likely to catch on this time: technology (as part of the solution) and the fact that these concerns cut across social and life sciences—that is, we are not alone. Neither side in the revolution has behaved well, and each has characterized the other in extreme terms (although, of course, each has had a few extreme actors). Some suggested reforms are already taking hold (e.g., journals asking for more transparency in methods and analysis decisions; journals publishing replications) but the feared tyrannical requirements have, of course, not taken root (e.g., few journals require open data; there is no ban on exploratory analyses). Still, we have not yet made needed advances in the ways in which we accumulate, connect, and extract conclusions from our aggregated research. However, we are now ready to move forward by adopting incremental changes and by acknowledging the multiplicity of goals within psychological science.},

This assumption is questioned and five basic points are raised: (1) because fat is not uniformly distributed over the carcass of an animal and because it is depleted sequentially when an animal is stressed, certain individuals may receive nutritionally inferior portions of meat, with potentially serious health consequences for the recipients during seasonal or interannual periods when other food resources are in short supply; (2) even when sharing is quantitatively and nutritionally equitable, food taboos may block certain individuals from access to meat and/or fat, particularly children, women at critical stages in their reproductive life, and the elderly (however, in the case of pregnant women, such food taboos and seemingly inequitable sharing practices may have positive as well as negative consequences for the health and survivorship of the fetus or newborn infant by keeping maternal protein consumption below about 20% of total calories and by reducing the mother's risk of exposure to potentially teratogenic substances that may accumulate in animal tissues); (3) skilled hunters may acquire nutritionally more valuable parts than do other males by âsnackingâ at kill sites and through differential sharing; (4) food-sharing practices and food taboos vary widely among foragers, and this diversity may contribute to observed differences among groups in fertility and infant mortality patterns; and (5) the focus of anthropologists on the sharing of food, especially meat, as opposed to the sharing of a broad spectrum of social, political, economic, and sexual rights and privileges, is an overly narrow and potentially misleading perspective. In closing, the paper briefly discusses the utility of the term âegalitarian,â concluding that the concept, by conflating ideology with actual behavior, may obscure rather than enhance our understanding of the origins and adaptations of foraging societies. },

Methods Data from one baseline-controlled two-period crossover study designed to compare sleep deprivation for up to 50 hours with food deprivation for up to 66 hours (n = 12) and data from regular multiple-deprivations survival training comparing participants (n = 33) with nondeprived instructors (n = 10). Results Food deprivation was associated with decreased body weight, blood glucose, serum triglycerides, sodium, chloride, and urine pH, and there were increases in blood and urine ketones and serum free fatty acids. Sleep deprivation was associated with a minor decrease in hemoglobin and erythrocyte particle count and volume fraction and an increase in leukocytes. Conclusions The clinical chemistry and body weight changes associated with food deprivation were qualitatively similar to those observed in fasting obese patients but developed quicker in the survival training setting. Sleep deprivation had few effects on the clinical chemistry profile except for hematological variables. Physicians evaluating clinical chemistry data from patients subjected to short-term food or sleep deprivation should take the physiological state into account in their assessment.},

Results Food deprivation and \{SD\} impaired attention-dependent tasks. The \{FD\} impairment of simple reaction time was independent of blood glucose levels, which were normalized by a 500 kcal intake over 24 hours while the reaction time was not. Sleep deprivation and \{FD\} impaired maze-solving performance on all variables except rule breaks, which were significantly occurring after 50 hours of SD. Delayed word recall was impaired by \{SD\} for 50 hours. On the Balloon Analogue Risk Task, \{SD\} was associated with reduced risk-taking. In a gambling task, both \{SD\} for 50 hours and \{FD\} for 66 hours were associated with a tendency to make early choices when presented with consecutive choices, but the risk-taking was not affected. Conclusions Sleep deprivation has multiple cognitive effects, including attention, memory, visual-spatial ability, and risk-taking. Food deprivation had no affect on risk-taking, while the other tasks were affected in a way similar to \{SD\} but were less pronounced. The \{FD\} effects on cognition did not appear to depend on blood sugar levels. The need to sleep should be prioritized in survival situations to avoid cognitive impairment.},

European Neandertals employed a complex set of physiological cold defenses, homologous to those seen in contemporary humans and nonhuman primates. While Neandertal morphological patterns, such as foreshortened extremities and low relative surface-area, may have explained some of the variance in cold resistance, it is suggested the adaptive package was strongly dependent on a rich array of physiological defenses. A summary of the environmental cold conditions in which the Neandertals lived is presented, and a comparative ethnographic model from Tierra del Fuego is used. Muscle and subcutaneous fat are excellent “passive” insulators. Neandertals were quite muscular, but it is unlikely that they could maintain enough superficial body fat to offer much cold protection. A major, high-energy metabolic adaptation facilitated by modest amounts of highly thermogenic brown adipose tissue (BAT) is proposed. In addition, Neandertals would have been protected by general mammalian cold defenses based on systemic vasoconstriction and intensified by acclimatization, aerobic fitness, and localized cold-induced vasodilation. However, these defenses are energetically expensive. Based on contemporary data from circumpolar peoples, it is estimated that Neandertals required 3,360 to 4,480 kcal per day to support strenuous winter foraging and cold resistance costs. Several specific genetic cold adaptations are also proposed—heat shock protein (actually, stress shock protein), an ACP*1 locus somatic growth factor, and a specialized calcium metabolism not as yet understood.

The primary outcome of interest was a fatal or non-fatal first event of venous thrombosis with the main focus on deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Publications with at least 10 events in total were eligible. The network meta-analysis was performed using an extension of frequentist random effects models for mixed multiple treatment comparisons. Unadjusted relative risks with 95\% confidence intervals were reported. The requirement for crude numbers did not allow adjustment for potential confounding variables.Results 3110 publications were retrieved through a search strategy; 25 publications reporting on 26 studies were included. Incidence of venous thrombosis in non-users from two included cohorts was 1.9 and 3.7 per 10 000 woman years, in line with previously reported incidences of 1-6 per 10 000 woman years. Use of combined oral contraceptives increased the risk of venous thrombosis compared with non-use (relative risk 3.5, 95\% confidence interval 2.9 to 4.3). The relative risk of venous thrombosis for combined oral contraceptives with 30-35 {\textmu}g ethinylestradiol and gestodene, desogestrel, cyproterone acetate, or drospirenone were similar and about 50-80\% higher than for combined oral contraceptives with levonorgestrel. A dose related effect of ethinylestradiol was observed for gestodene, desogestrel, and levonorgestrel, with higher doses being associated with higher thrombosis risk.Conclusion All combined oral contraceptives investigated in this analysis were associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis. The effect size depended both on the progestogen used and the dose of ethinylestradiol.},

  abstract      = {We examined the impact of famine-induced changes in maternal birth weight (MBW) on the association between MBW and offspring birth weight (OBW). Women born before, during, and after the Dutch Famine of 1944-1945 were interviewed at ages 41 to 46 years. Women (n = 582) and their children (n = 1,111) were included in the analysis if both mother and child were singleton and the child was not delivered preterm. Mean birth weight (BW) of women with first-trimester exposure (n = 110) was 154 g higher (p = 0.008), and mean BW of women with third-trimester exposure (n = 138) was 251 g lower (p < 0.001) than mean BW of unexposed women (n = 302). First-born offspring of women with first-trimester exposure were 72 g heavier (95% confidence interval [CI], -57 to 201; p = 0.27), and offspring of women with third-trimester exposure were 43 g lighter (95% CI, -170 to 79; p = 0.47) than offspring of unexposed women. Among unexposed women, each 100 g increase in MBW was associated with 25 g (95% CI, 12 to 37) increase in OBW (adjusted for maternal age, smoking, weight, and height and offspring sex). This association was attenuated in famine-exposed women (first-trimester change in OBW = 20 g per 100 g MBW; 95% CI, -1 to 41; third-trimester change in OBW = 14 g per 100 g MBW; 95% CI, -9 to 37). When MBW and trimester of maternal famine exposure were considered in a joint model, there was no independent effect of trimester of maternal famine exposure on OBW. Associations were less consistent for later-born offspring. We conclude that maternal prenatal famine exposure does not affect the association between maternal and offspring BW. Trimester of exposure was not a determinant of OBW, other than through its effect on MBW. Nevertheless, acute famine may impact on second-generation BW distributions indirectly, through its effect on the distribution of MBW.},

Here we measured five life skills—conscientiousness, emotional stability, determination, control, and optimism—in 8,119 men and women aged 52 and older (mean 66.7 y). We show that the number of skills is associated with wealth, income, subjective wellbeing, less depression, low social isolation and loneliness, more close relationships, better self-rated health, fewer chronic diseases and impaired activities of daily living, faster walking speed, and favorable objective biomarkers (concentration of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, vitamin D and C-reactive protein, and less central obesity). Life skills also predicted sustained psychological wellbeing, less loneliness, and a lower incidence of new chronic disease and physical impairment over a 4-y period. These analyses took account of age, sex, parental socioeconomic background, education, and cognitive function. No single life skill was responsible for the associations we observed, nor were they driven by factors such as socioeconomic status or health. Despite the vicissitudes of later life, life skills impact a range of outcomes, and the maintenance of these attributes may benefit the older population.},

The idea that humans produce pheromones has excited the imagination of scientists and the public, leading to widespread claims for their existence, which, however, has remained unproven. Here we investigate whether humans produce compounds that regulate a specific neuroendocrine mechanism in other people without being consciously detected as odours (thereby fulfilling the classic definition of a pheromone). We found that odourless compounds from the armpits of women in the late follicular phase of their menstrual cycles accelerated the preovulatory surge of luteinizing hormone of recipient women and shortened their menstrual cycles. Axillary (underarm) compounds from the same donors which were collected later in the menstrual cycle (at ovulation) had the opposite effect: they delayed the luteinizing-hormone surge of the recipients and lengthened their menstrual cycles. By showing in a fully controlled experiment that the timing of ovulation can be manipulated, this study provides definitive evidence of human pheromones.},

  abstract      = {Background. The positive results of the Norwegian anti-bullying programme (Olweus, 1992) stimulated other countries to tackle bully/victim problems. However, outcome studies found rather low levels of effect or even inconsistent results. Aims. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate behavioural effectiveness of a school-based anti-bullying approach within Flemish schools. In addition, specific attention was given to the relationship between outcome findings and external support. Sample. A total of 18 schools, comprising 1104 primary and secondary school children were recruited for this study. Students ranged in age from 10 to 16 years. Method. For this study, an experimental pre-test/post-test design was used which included a control group. Three groups were established. The first group, Treatment with Support, involved students from schools that implemented a school-based anti-bullying intervention with additional support from the research group. The second group, Treatment without Support, also involved students from schools that implemented a school-based anti-bullying programme. However, in contrast with those falling under the first condition, this group of schools could not appeal to the research group for additional help. The last group involved students from schools that did not implement the anti-bullying programme and served as a Control condition. Repeated measures analyses of variance were carried out. Results. The findings regarding the effects of the school-based anti-bullying intervention programme on the extent of bullying and victimisation showed a mixed pattern of positive changes in primary schools and zero outcomes in secondary schools. The findings regarding the effects of external support revealed limited outcomes. Conclusions. The outcomes of the evaluation study confirm that a schoolbased anti-bullying intervention strategy can be effective in reducing problems with bullying, especially within primary schools. It was argued that the developmental characteristics of secondary school students interfered with the outcomes. In addition, the findings revealed no extra effects of training sessions.},

Decreased plasma magnesium concentrations were a
consistent feature from the first month onwards. After
100 days of fasting there was a marked and persistent
increase in the excretion of urinary cations and

These increases may be due to dissolution of excessive
soft tissue and skeletal mass. Prolonged fasting in this

erol could stimulate gluconeogenesis and also con-
tribute to regulating hepatic glycogen stores. We ex-
amined their effect on liver glycogen breakdown in
humans.
Methods. After an overnight fast healthy subjects par-
ticipated in three protocols with lipid/heparin (plas-
ma non-esterified fatty acids: 2.2  0.1 mol/l; plasma
glycerol: 0.5  0.03 mol/l; n = 7), glycerol (0.4 
0.1 mol/l; 1.5  0.2 mol/l; n = 5) and saline infusion
(control; 0.5  0.1 mol/l; 0.2  0.02 mol/l; n = 7). Net
rates of glycogen breakdown were calculated from
the decrease of liver glycogen within 9 h using 13 C nu-
clear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Endogenous
glucose production was measured with infusion of
D-[6,6- 2 H 2 ]glucose.
Results. Endogenous glucose production decreased by
about 25 % during lipid and saline infusion (p < 0.005)
but not during glycerol infusion (p < 0.001 vs lipid, sa-
line). An increase of plasma non-esterified fatty acids
or glycerol reduced the net glycogen breakdown by
about 84 % to 0.6  0.3 mmol ́ kg ±1 ́ min ±1 (p < 0.001
vs saline: 3.7  0.5 mmol ́ kg ±1 ́ min ±1 ) and by about
46 % to 2.0  0.4 mmol ́ kg ±1 ́ min ±1 (p < 0.01 vs saline
and lipid), respectively. Rates of gluconeogenesis in-
creased to 11.5  0.8 mmol ́ kg ±1 ́ min ±1 (p < 0.01) and
12.8  1.0 mmol ́ kg ±1 ́ min ±1 (p < 0.01 vs saline: 8.2 
0.7 mmol ́ l ±1 ́ min ±1 ), respectively.
Conclusion/interpretation: An increase of non-esteri-
fied fatty acid leads to a pronounced inhibition of net
hepatic glycogen breakdown and increases gluconeo-
genesis whereas glucose production does not differ
from the control condition. We suggest that this effect
is not due to increased availability of glycerol alone
but rather to lipid-dependent control of hepatic glyco-
gen stores. [Diabetologia (2001) 44: 48±54]

This mixed-methods research study used the College and University Classroom Environment Inventory (CUCEI), field notes, interviews and focus groups to investigate the learning environments of these two classrooms. Students in the inverted classroom were less satisfied with how the classroom structure oriented them to the learning tasks in the course, but they became more open to cooperative learning and innovative teaching methods. These findings are discussed in terms of how they contribute to the stability and connectedness of classroom learning communities.},

Regulatory reassessments in North American countries have recently been completed for insect repellents containing DEET as active ingredient, resulting in labeling changes intended to minimize unnecessary exposure to special populations, including children. This article describes those changes, and summarizes more recent data relating to the pharmacokinetics, toxicology, and epidemiology of adverse effects associated with DEET in humans.},

After weight loss, changes in the circulating levels of several peripheral hormones involved in the homeostatic regulation of body weight occur. Whether these changes are transient or persist over time may be important for an understanding of the reasons behind the high rate of weight regain after diet-induced weight loss.
Full Text of Background...
METHODS
We enrolled 50 overweight or obese patients without diabetes in a 10-week weight-loss program for which a very-low-energy diet was prescribed. At baseline (before weight loss), at 10 weeks (after program completion), and at 62 weeks, we examined circulating levels of leptin, ghrelin, peptide YY, gastric inhibitory polypeptide, glucagon-like peptide 1, amylin, pancreatic polypeptide, cholecystokinin, and insulin and subjective ratings of appetite.
Full Text of Methods...
RESULTS
Weight loss (mean [±SE], 13.5±0.5 kg) led to significant reductions in levels of leptin, peptide YY, cholecystokinin, insulin (P<0.001 for all comparisons), and amylin (P=0.002) and to increases in levels of ghrelin (P<0.001), gastric inhibitory polypeptide (P=0.004), and pancreatic polypeptide (P=0.008). There was also a significant increase in subjective appetite (P<0.001). One year after the initial weight loss, there were still significant differences from baseline in the mean levels of leptin (P<0.001), peptide YY (P<0.001), cholecystokinin (P=0.04), insulin (P=0.01), ghrelin (P<0.001), gastric inhibitory polypeptide (P<0.001), and pancreatic polypeptide (P=0.002), as well as hunger (P<0.001).
Full Text of Results...
CONCLUSIONS
One year after initial weight reduction, levels of the circulating mediators of appetite that encourage weight regain after diet-induced weight loss do not revert to the levels recorded before weight loss. Long-term strategies to counteract this change may be needed to prevent obesity relapse.

The results revealed that smoke extracts differed considerably in their ability to inhibit the growth of the investigated pathogens. A. hydrophila was the most susceptible organism. Extracts L1, L2 and S caused a gradual decline in A. hydrophila viable cell counts to reach undetectable levels. Extracts S was bacteriostatic to L. monocytogenes and Y. enterocolitica. Extract L1 reduced populations of these organisms during the experiment. Extract L2 reduced the population of L. monocytogenes. This extract did not affect, however, Y. enterocolitica growth. The least effective extract was L3 which only inhibited the growth of A. hydrophila during the experimental period and did not show any effect against L. monocytogenes and Y. enterocolitica. The compounds and their relative concentrations identified and quantified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry varied greatly among the analysed condensates. No relation has been shown between the antimicrobial activity and the concentration of phenols of smoke preparations.},

Also, we analysed whether the coverage referred to actual research. The results indicated that mostly textbooks fail to fully represent the strategies. Accurate textbooks are used in a minority of TEPs. Implications and challenges for authors, \{TEPs\} and policy-makers are discussed.},

Muskotn{\"{o}}t i stora m{\"{a}}ngder {\"{a}}r giftigt och kan leda till allvarlig f{\"{o}}rgiftning. Skolan har anm{\"{a}}lt det intr{\"{a}}ffade till polisen som tidigare inte haft k{\"{a}}nnedom om det intr{\"{a}}ffade


Unga i Kiruna anv{\"{a}}nder inte bara bensin f{\"{o}}r att berusa sig. Även en krydda har blivit ett problem. Nyligen blev fyra h{\"{o}}gstadieungdomar f{\"{o}}rgiftade av muskotn{\"{o}}t och fick intensivv{\r{a}}rd p{\r{a}} sjukhus.

Muskotn{\"{o}}t {\"{a}}r en krydda som finns i matbutiken och hemma i m{\r{a}}ngas kryddsk{\r{a}}p. De senaste veckorna har b{\r{a}}de akuten och skolor i Kiruna slagit larm om att unga tar kryddan f{\"{o}}r att berusa sig. Muskot har en amfetaminliknande {\"{a}}mne i sig som p{\r{a}}minner om en seg fylla.

- Det {\"{a}}r j{\"{a}}tteallvarligt. Effekten kommer n{\r{a}}gra timmar senare. Vi hade inte h{\"{o}}rt talas om det h{\"{a}}r med muskotn{\"{o}}t f{\"{o}}rut. Tyv{\"{a}}rr {\"{a}}r det s{\r{a}} att ungdomarna oftast ligger steget f{\"{o}}re oss, s{\"{a}}ger Maria Jonsson som jobbar i socialtj{\"{a}}nstens ungdomsgrupp i Kiruna.

En del blandar kryddan i glass och andra kokar te p{\r{a}} den. Men att {\"{a}}ta muskot som annat {\"{a}}n just lite kryddning kan sluta riktigt illa. Fyra unga personer i Kiruna blev nyligen f{\"{o}}rgiftade och fick intensivv{\r{a}}rd p{\r{a}} sjukhuset.

- Det p{\r{a}}verkar njurarna p{\r{a}} n{\r{a}}got s{\"{a}}tt s{\r{a}} att man inte kan kissa och s{\r{a}} fick de allvarlig hj{\"{a}}rtklappning. Det var v{\"{a}}ldigt allvarligt just d{\r{a}}, de fick k{\"{a}}mpa och f{\"{o}}r{\"{a}}ldrar och alla runtomkring var j{\"{a}}tteoroliga, s{\"{a}}ger Maria Jonsson.

Kan man se n{\r{a}}gra tecken n{\r{a}}gon som har {\"{a}}tit mycket muskotn{\"{o}}t?

- En f{\"{o}}r{\"{a}}lder till en av ungdomarna har beskrivit att talet var sluddrigt, benen bar inte och en enorm tr{\"{o}}tthet som varar i flera dagar. Ungdomarna sj{\"{a}}lva beskriver ocks{\r{a}} den tr{\"{o}}ttheten och att de sover och sover, s{\"{a}}ger Maria Jonsson.},

was given orally at 0900 hours.
A battery of psychomotor tests and visual analogue scales
was administered before treatment and at 1, 2 and 3 h post-
treatment. The objective tests showed a significant increase
in tapping rate in the young, while the elderly showed im-
proved attention, faster choice-reaction time, and greater
body sway on caffeine. The visual analogue scales showed
that the young subjects felt more alert, calmer, more inter-
ested, and steadier on caffeine, while no significant changes
were seen in the elderly. These results show that caffeine
produces changes predominantly in the direction of im-
proved performance and feeling of well-being, and suggest
that the elderly are more sensitive to the objective effects
of the drug, while reporting less subjective effect than the
young.

  abstract      = {Objective: To evaluate the effect of statins on short-term cognitive function and the long-term incidence of dementia. Patients and Methods: A systematic search was performed of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register from their inception to April 25, 2013. Adults with no history of cognitive dysfunction treated with statins were included from high-quality randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies after formal bias assessment. Results: Sixteen studies were included in qualitative synthesis and 11 in quantitative synthesis. Shortterm trials did not show a consistent effect of statin therapy on cognitive end points. Digit Symbol Substitution Testing (a well-validated measure of cognitive function) was the most common short-term end point, with no significant differences in the mean change from baseline to follow-up between the statin and placebo groups (mean change, 1.65; 95% CI, e0.03 to 3.32; 296 total exposures in 3 trials). Long-term cognition studies included 23,443 patients with a mean exposure duration of 3 to 24.9 years. Three studies found no association between statin use and incident dementia, and 5 found a favorable effect. Pooled results revealed a 29% reduction in incident dementia in statin-treated patients (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.61-0.82). Conclusion: In patients without baseline cognitive dysfunction, short-term data are most compatible with no adverse effect of statins on cognition, and long-term data may support a beneficial role for statins in the prevention of dementia.},

Complementary profiling of parasite, vertebrate and plant DNA proved highly informative in the study of ancient health, human-animal interactions as well as animal and plant dietary components. Most prominent were finding of soil-borne parasites transmitted directly between humans, but also meat-borne parasites that require consumption of raw or undercooked fish and pork. The detection of parasites for which sheep, horse, dog, pig, and rodents serves as definitive hosts are clear markers of domestic and synanthropic animals living in closer proximity of the respective sites. Finally, the reconstruction of full mitochondrial parasite genomes from whipworm (Ascaris lumbricoides) and roundworm species (Trichuris trichiura and Trichuris muris) and estimates of haplotype frequencies elucidates the genetic diversity and provides insights into epidemiology and parasite biology.},

Then, we connect the development and maintenance of situation awareness and tacit knowledge to our argument as it relates to actions performed in relation to the emergency event. Finally, we provide a concluding discussion of the Piper Alpha disaster in order explore implications for emergency response management.

there are no reports achieving high hatchability of ＞50% using completely artificial vessels. To establish a simple
method for culturing chick embryos with high hatchability, we examined various culture conditions, including
methods for calcium supplementation and oxygen aeration. In the embryo cultures where the embryos were transferred
to the culture vessel after 55-56 h incubation, more than 90% of embryos survived until day 17 when a
polymethylpentene film was used as a culture vessel with calcium lactate and distilled water supplementations. The
aeration of pure oxygen to the surviving embryos from day 17 yielded a hatchability of 57.1% (8out of 14). Thus, we
successfully achieved a high hatchability with this method in chicken embryo culture using an artificial vessel.

Here we examine plasma hormone levels and histology in the testis of mice following either 4- or 8-week oral administration of bisphenol A. Plasma free testosterone levels were dramatically decreased following 8 weeks of bisphenol A treatment compared with control group and morphologically multinucleated giant cells having greater than three nuclei were found in seminiferous tubules in the testis following the 8-week bisphenol A treatment. No differences in plasma corticosterone and luteinizing hormone levels were seen between bisphenol A and control groups. Thus, exposure with bisphenol A around pubertal period may directly disrupt the male reproductive tract. These facts suggest that more detailed studies will warrant the assessment of the risk to the developing human testis from exposure to bisphenol A and other environmental estrogens in prepubertal and pubertal period. },

I analyze the joint evolution of a social signal and behavioral responsiveness to the signal by a quantitative-genetic model. The equilibria of average phenotypes maintained by a balance of social selection and natural selection and their stability are examined for two alternative assumptions on behavioral responsiveness, neutral and adaptive. When behavioral responsiveness is neutral on fitness, a rapid evolution by runaway selection occurs only with enough genetic covariance between the signal and responsiveness. The condition for rapid evolution also depends on natural selection and the number of interacting individuals. When signals convey some information on signalers (e.g., fighting ability), behavioral responsiveness is adaptive such that a receiver's fitness is also influenced by the signal. Here there is a single point of equilibrium. The equilibrium point and its stability do not depend on the genetic correlation. The condition needed for evolution is that the signal is beneficial for receivers, which results from reliability of the signal. Frequency-dependent selection on responsiveness has almost no influence on the equilibrium and the rate of evolution.},

A pressing question is not only whether high terrestrial support is possible but also what the general conditions are under which it arises. We assemble the largest data set, to date, of the isotopic composition (Î´2H, Î´13C, and Î´15N) of lake zooplankton and the resources at the base of their associated food webs. In total, our data set spans 559 observations across 147 lakes from the boreal to subtropics. By predicting terrestrial resource support from within-lake and catchment-level characteristics, we found that half of all consumer observations that is, the median were composed of at least 42\% terrestrially derived material. In general, terrestrial support of zooplankton was greatest in lakes with large physical and hydrological connections to catchments that were rich in aboveground and belowground organic matter. However, some consumers responded less strongly to terrestrial resources where within-lake production was elevated. Our study shows that multiple mechanisms drive widespread cross-ecosystem support of aquatic consumers across Northern Hemisphere lakes and suggests that changes in terrestrial landscapes will influence ecosystem processes well beyond their boundaries.},

  abstract      = {Background Coadministration of a bacterial adjuvant with oral immunotherapy (OIT) has been suggested as a potential treatment for food allergy. Objective To evaluate a combined therapy comprising a probiotic together with peanut OIT. Methods We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial of the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus \{CGMCC\} 1.3724 and peanut \{OIT\} (probiotic and peanut oral immunotherapy [PPOIT]) in children (1-10 years) with peanut allergy. The primary outcome was induction of sustained unresponsiveness 2 to 5 weeks after discontinuation of treatment (referred to as possible sustained unresponsiveness). Secondary outcomes were desensitization, peanut skin prick test, and specific IgE and specific IgG4 measurements. Results Sixty-two children were randomized and stratified by age (â¤5 and &gt;5 years) and peanut skin test wheal size (â¤10 and &gt;10 mm); 56 reached the trial's end. Baseline demographics were similar across groups. Possible sustained unresponsiveness was achieved in 82.1% receiving \{PPOIT\} and 3.6% receiving placebo (PÂ &lt; .001). Nine children need to be treated for 7 to achieve sustained unresponsiveness (number needed to treat, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.06-1.59). Of the subjects, 89.7% receiving \{PPOIT\} and 7.1% receiving placebo were desensitized (PÂ &lt; .001). \{PPOIT\} was associated with reduced peanut skin prick test responses and peanut-specific IgE levels and increased peanut-specific IgG4 levels (all PÂ &lt; .001). PPOIT-treated participants reported a greater number of adverse events, mostly with maintenance home dosing. Conclusion This is the first randomized placebo-controlled trial evaluating the novel coadministration of a probiotic and peanut \{OIT\} and assessing sustained unresponsiveness in children with peanut allergy. \{PPOIT\} was effective in inducing possible sustained unresponsiveness and immune changes that suggest modulation of the peanut-specific immune response. Further work is required to confirm sustained unresponsiveness after a longer period of secondary peanut elimination and to clarify the relative contributions of probiotics versus OIT. },

  abstract      = {The properties of liquid water are intimately related to the H-bond network among the individual water molecules. Utilizing vibrational spectroscopy and modeling water with DFT-optimized water clusters (6-mers and 50-mers), 16 out of a possible 36 different types of H-bonds are identified and ordered according to their intrinsic strength. The strongest H-bonds are obtained as a result of a concerted push–pull effect of four peripheral water molecules, which polarize the electron density in a way that supports charge transfer and partial covalent character of the targeted H-bond. For water molecules with tetra- and pentacoordinated O atoms, H-bonding is often associated with a geometrically unfavorable positioning of the acceptor lone pair and donor σ*(OH) orbitals so that electrostatic rather than covalent interactions increasingly dominate H-bonding. There is a striking linear dependence between the intrinsic strength of H-bonding as measured by the local H-bond stretching force constant and the delocalization energy associated with charge transfer. Molecular dynamics simulations for 1000-mers reveal that with increasing temperature weak, preferentially electrostatic H-bonds are broken, whereas the number of strong H-bonds increases. An explanation for the question why warm water freezes faster than cold water is given on a molecular basis.},

  abstract      = {Accumulation of toxic protein aggregatesâamyloid-Î² (AÎ²) plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau tanglesâis the pathological hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD). AÎ² accumulation has been hypothesized to result from an imbalance between AÎ² production and clearance; indeed, AÎ² clearance seems to be impaired in both early and late forms of AD. To develop efficient strategies to slow down or halt AD, it is critical to understand how AÎ² is cleared from the brain. Extracellular AÎ² deposits can be removed from the brain by various clearance systems, most importantly, transport across the bloodâbrain barrier. Findings from the past few years suggest that astroglial-mediated interstitial fluid (ISF) bulk flow, known as the glymphatic system, might contribute to a larger portion of extracellular AÎ² (eAÎ²) clearance than previously thought. The meningeal lymphatic vessels, discovered in 2015, might provide another clearance route. Because these clearance systems act together to drive eAÎ² from the brain, any alteration to their function could contribute to AD. An understanding of AÎ² clearance might provide strategies to reduce excess AÎ² deposits and delay, or even prevent, disease onset. In this Review, we describe the clearance systems of the brain as they relate to proteins implicated in AD pathology, with the main focus on AÎ².},

  abstract      = {Global climate changes are magnified in the Arctic and are having an especially dramatic effect on the spatial and temporal distribution and the thickness traits of sea ice. Decline of Arctic sea ice may lead to qualitative and/or quantitative changes in diet and reduced body condition (i.e. adipose tissue stores) of ice-associated apex predators such as polar bears (Ursus maritimus). This may further affect their tissue concentrations of lipophilic pollutants. We determined how variations in adipose tissue stores associated to both breeding status and spatial changes in sea ice conditions and diet influence concentrations and biotransformation of lipophilic persistent organic pollutants (POPs). We collected 112 blood and fat samples from female polar bears (Ursus maritimus) of different breeding status (alone, with cubs of the year, or with yearlings) during two seasons (April and September) in 2012 and 2013 at three locations of Svalbard, Norway, with contrasted sea ice conditions. We inferred diet from nitrogen and carbon stable isotope ratios in red blood cells and fatty acid composition in adipose tissue. Relative to diet, body condition, which was negatively related to sea ice extent at both temporal and spatial scales, was the most important predictor for concentrations of POPs in plasma and fat, whereas diet showed a minor influence. Additionally, fatter females were more efficient at biotransforming PCBs than were leaner ones. Breeding status influenced the concentrations of less lipophilic compounds such as Î²-hexachlorocyclohexane, which were lower in females with yearlings, probably due to excretion into milk and subsequent offloading to young. In conclusion, our results indicate that declining sea ice indirectly leads to increased concentrations of lipophilic pollutants in polar bears mediated through reduced feeding opportunities and declining body condition rather than changes in diet composition.},

Studying the frog neurotoxin epibatidine, which binds to acetylcholine receptors, Tarvin et al. found a single amino acid substitution. The substitution changes the configuration of the acetylcholine receptor, so that it decreases its sensitivity to the toxin. But acetylcholine signaling is essential for normal life. Expressing poison frog and human receptors in frog eggs revealed that different amino acid substitutions have occurred in different lineages that allow the frog to resist its own toxins while still letting target neurotransmitters function effectively.Science, this issue p. 1261Animals that wield toxins face self-intoxication. Poison frogs have a diverse arsenal of defensive alkaloids that target the nervous system. Among them is epibatidine, a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist that is lethal at microgram doses. Epibatidine shares a highly conserved binding site with acetylcholine, making it difficult to evolve resistance yet maintain nAChR function. Electrophysiological assays of human and frog nAChR revealed that one amino acid replacement, which evolved three times in poison frogs, decreased epibatidine sensitivity but at a cost of acetylcholine sensitivity. However, receptor functionality was rescued by additional amino acid replacements that differed among poison frog lineages. Our results demonstrate how resistance to agonist toxins can evolve and that such genetic changes propel organisms toward an adaptive peak of chemical defense.},

This view was challenged by our observations of nighttime body temperatures sustained well above ambient (up to 10{\textdegree}C) during the reproductive season in tegu lizards (~2 kg). This led us to hypothesize that tegus have an enhanced capacity to augment heat production and heat conservation. Increased metabolic rates and decreased thermal conductance are the same mechanisms involved in body temperature regulation in those vertebrates traditionally acknowledged as {\textquotedblleft}true endotherms{\textquotedblright}: the birds and mammals. The appreciation that a modern ectotherm the size of the earliest mammals can sustain an elevated body temperature through metabolic rates approaching that of endotherms enlightens the debate over endothermy origins, providing support for the parental care model of endothermy, but not for the assimilation capacity model of endothermy. It also indicates that, contrary to prevailing notions, ectotherms can engage in facultative endothermy, providing a physiological analog in the evolutionary transition to true endothermy.},

Except for the control group, all men ate a diet of pure carbohydrate and 4.5 gm of NaCl daily during the period of caloric restriction. Assigned work requiring 1200 Cal/ day was performed by each subject in both experiments. The 580 Cal/day prevented ketosis and demonstrable liver damage but failed to maintain adequate work blood sugar levels. The capacity to preform both aerobic and anaerobic work tasks was well maintained but pulmonary ventilation during work, the O2 debt and pulse rate responses to a fixed task indicated some deterioration. The 1010 Cal/day maintained satisfactory work blood sugar levels and there was no evidence of poor physiological response to the stress of work. No important change occurred in grip strength or in the maximal oxygen intake per kilogram of body weight or fat free tissue in either experiment. But the total maximal oxygen intake declined slowly in both experiments. Data from the Minnesota experiment on 6 months of semistarvation were pooled with the current observations to show that a marked deterioration in both maximal oxygen intake and strength as measured by the hand dynamometer took place between a weight loss of 10 and 16\%. It is concluded that when sufficient calories and NaCl in the presence of an adequate vitamin intake are provided to prevent ketosis, dehydration and hypoglycemia under conditions of moderate energy output, performance capacity is well maintained up to a weight loss of 10\% of the original body weight.

Yet interleaving, but not blocking, ensures that practice of any particular skill is distributed, or spaced, because any two opportunities to practice the same task are not consecutive. Hence, because spaced practice typically improves test performance, the previously observed test benefits of interleaving may be due to spacing rather than interleaving per se. In the experiment reported herein, children practiced four kinds of mathematics problems in an order that was interleaved or blocked, and the degree of spacing was fixed. The interleaving of practice impaired practice session performance yet doubled scores on a test given one day later. An analysis of the errors suggested that interleaving boosted test scores by improving participants' ability to pair each problem with the appropriate procedure.

Objective: This systematic review assesses the quality of the evidence for whole dietary patterns across various outcomes related to cognitive function in healthy adult populations to develop research recommendations for the military. Data Sources:PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, PsycInfo, and the Cochrane Library were searched. Study Selection: Peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials published in the English language were eligible. Data Extraction:Fifteen included trials were assessed for methodological quality, and descriptive data were extracted. Data Synthesis: Of the 6 acceptable-quality studies, 1 demonstrated statistically nonsignificant results, whereas the other 5 showed conflicting results across the cognitive outcomes assessed.Conclusions:Due to the heterogeneity across the included studies, no recommendations could be reached concerning whether certain whole dietary patterns have an effect on cognitive outcomes in healthy populations. Specific recommendations for future research are offered.

The mechanisms driving recurrent post-dieting obesity remain largely elusive. Here, we identify an intestinal microbiome signature that persists after successful dieting of obese mice, which contributes to faster weight regain and metabolic aberrations upon re-exposure to obesity-promoting conditions and transmits the accelerated weight regain phenotype upon inter-animal transfer. We develop a machine-learning algorithm that enables personalized microbiome-based prediction of the extent of post-dieting weight regain. Additionally, we find that the microbiome contributes to diminished post-dieting flavonoid levels and reduced energy expenditure, and demonstrate that flavonoid-based âpost-bioticâ intervention ameliorates excessive secondary weight gain. Together, our data highlight a possible microbiome contribution to accelerated post-dieting weight regain, and suggest that microbiome-targeting approaches may help to diagnose and treat this common disorder.},

To test this hypothesis, 17 normal subjects were scanned for quantifiable brain activity changes during 85Â h of sleep deprivation using positron emission tomography (PET) and 18Fluorine-2-deoxyglucose (18FDG), a marker for regional cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRglu) and neuronal synaptic activity. Subjects were scanned prior to and at 24-h intervals during the sleep deprivation period, for a total of four scans per subject. During each 30 min 18FDG uptake, subjects performed a sleep deprivation-sensitive Serial Addition/Subtraction task. Polysomnographic monitoring confirmed that subjects were awake. Twenty-four hours of sleep deprivation, reported here, resulted in a significant decrease in global CMRglu, and significant decreases in absolute regional CMRglu in several cortical and subcortical structures. No areas of the brain evidenced a significant increase in absolute regional CMRglu. Significant decreases in relative regional CMRglu, reflecting regional brain reductions greater than the global decrease, occurred predominantly in the thalamus and prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices. Alertness and cognitive performance declined in association with these brain deactivations. This study provides evidence that short-term sleep deprivation produces global decreases in brain activity, with larger reductions in activity in the distributed cortico-thalamic network mediating attention and higher-order cognitive processes, and is complementary to studies demonstrating deactivation of these cortical regions during NREM and REM sleep.},

In the cold room, O/W was applied on one cheek and petrolatum on the other. The cheeks were exposed to wind, produced by a fan, to cool further the skin by the wind chill index. Skin temperature, redness, and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) were measured on both cheeks.ResultsÂ Facial skin treated with O/W was significantly colder (up to 1Â·3Â Â°C) than facial skin treated with petrolatum, but the difference disappeared within 20Â min. Agreement between temperature measurements and subjective thermal sensations was poor (Cohen's ÎºÂ =Â â0Â·13). At no point did the paired skin redness and the paired TEWL values vary significantly. The TEWL levels were significantly lower 30Â min after the cold exposure than before, but had reached pre-exposure levels the following day.ConclusionsÂ This study demonstrates that for a duration exposure of 20Â min, facial skin treated with O/W achieves a lower temperature than facial skin treated with petrolatum. The two emollients had in all other aspects the same effect on the response of facial skin to cold.},

  abstract      = {SummaryBackground The SteriPENÂ® is a handheld device for disinfecting water with ultraviolet (UV) radiation. The manufacturer claims a reduction of at least 99.9% of bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. The present study intends to verify the general effectiveness of the device. Furthermore, the influence of bottle geometry and water movement is examined and the issue of user safety with regard to UV-C radiation is addressed. Methods The device was applied on water containing a known number of microorganisms (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and the spore of Geobacillus stearothermophilus) and the survival rate was examined. Three different types of bottles commonly used among travelers served as test containers. All tests were conducted with and without agitating the water during irradiation. Furthermore, a spectral analysis was performed on the light of the device. Results The SteriPENÂ® reached a mean reduction of more than 99.99% of bacteria and 99.57% of the spores when applied correctly. However, the results of the trials without agitating the water only yielded a 94.98% germ reduction. The device's maximal radiation intensity lies at 254 nm which is the wavelength most efficient in inactivating bacteria. The UV-C fraction is filtered out completely by common bottle materials. However, when applied in larger containers a portion of the UV-C rays exits the water surface. Conclusions If applied according to the instructions the device manages a satisfactory inactivation of bacteria. However, it bears the danger of user errors relevant to health. Therefore, education on the risks of incorrect application should be included in the travel medical consultation. Also there are still aspects that need to be subject to further independent research. },

  abstract      = {Migration may result in exposure to factors that are both beneficial and harmful for good health. How the act of migration is associated with mortality, or whether the socio-economic condition of migrants prior to migration influences their mortality trajectory, is not well understood. In the present study, a cohort of 413 randomly selected individuals born in the rural community of Ãverkalix, Sweden, between 1890 and 1935 were followed from birth to either death or old age. Around 50% of the study-population moved away from Ãverkalix at one time or another. To adjust for a potential bias resulting from self-selection among the migrants, the fatherâs occupational status was used together with parentsâ and grandparentsâ longevity. Overall, migration could not be shown to predict mortality when the backgrounds of the migrants were taken into account. Nonetheless, socio-economic background conditions appeared to moderate the association, decreasing the mortality rates for migrants with relatively good pre-migratory socio-economic conditions, while increasing it for migrants with poorer pre-migratory conditions. However, further scrutiny revealed that this effect modification mainly affected the female migrantsâ mortality. In conclusion, the study suggests that there is no general association between migration and mortality, but that migrants with better socio-economic resources are more likely to improve their mortality trajectories than migrants with poorer resources. Better pre-migratory conditions hence appear to be important for avoiding health-adverse circumstances and gaining access to health beneficial living conditions when moving to foreign environments â especially for women. },

a cross-sectional survey was used to analyse data. The results indicated
three important predictors of turnover intentions amongst newly
qualified teachers. First, mutual trust is important amongst school
professionals. Second, it is necessary to encourage newly qualified
teachers’ emotional commitment to their profession and workplace to
diminish turnover intentions. Finally, perceived role conflict has a
significant effect on turnover intentions.

These SNPs originated on different haplotype backgrounds from the European C/T-13910 SNP and from each other. Genotyping across a 3-Mb region demonstrated haplotype homozygosity extending >2.0 Mb on chromosomes carrying C-14010, consistent with a selective sweep over the past ~7,000 years.

•
Ovarian hormones fluctuations influence the activation of cortical and sub-cortical brain regions in healthy fertile women.
•
Exogenous sex steroids seem to be a substantial determinant of functional changes in neural activity.
•
PMDD is likely due to an impaired ovarian hormones-mediated sensitivity of emotional and cognitive brain networks.
•
Neuroimaging studies need to consider the influence of sex steroids on the neural substrates of emotion and cognition.
Summary
Ovarian hormones are pivotal for the physiological maintenance of the brain function as well as its response to environmental stimuli. There is mounting evidence attesting the relevance of endogenous ovarian hormones as well as exogenous estradiol and progesterone for emotional and cognitive processing.

The present review systematically summarized current knowledge on sex steroid hormonal modulation of neural substrates of emotion and cognition revealed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twenty-four studies of healthy naturally cycling and combined oral contraceptives (COC) user women, or women undergoing experimental manipulations, during their reproductive age, were included. Furthermore, six studies of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), a hormonally based mood disorder, and three of gender dysphoria (GD), which provides an intriguing opportunity to examine the effect of high-dose cross-sex hormone therapy (CSHT) on brain functioning, were included. Globally, low (early follicular and the entire follicular phase for estrogen and progesterone, respectively) and high (COC, CSHT, late follicular and luteal phase for estrogen; COC, mid- and late-luteal phase for progesterone) hormonal milieu diversely affected the response of several brain regions including the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, and inferior frontal gyrus, but their functional recruitment across groups and domains was scattered.

The constellation of findings provides initial evidence of the influence of sex steroid hormones on cortical and subcortical regions implicated in emotional and cognitive processing. Further well-powered and multimodal neuroimaging studies will be needed to identify the neural mechanism of functional brain alterations induced by sex steroid hormones.

  abstract      = {The River G{\"{o}}ta Älv is a source of fresh-water for the City of Gothenburg (Sweden). We recently identified a clear association between upstream precipitation and indicator bacteria concentrations in the river water outside the intake to the drinking water utility. This study aimed to determine if variation in the incidence of acute gastrointestinal illnesses is associated with upstream precipitation. We acquired data, covering 1494 days, on the daily number of telephone calls to the nurse advice line from citizens in Gothenburg living in areas with G{\"{o}}ta Älv as a fresh-water supply. We separated calls relating to gastrointestinal illnesses from other medical concerns, and analyzed their association with precipitation using a distributed lag non-linear Poisson regression model, adjusting for seasonal patterns and covariates. We used a 0-21-day lag period for precipitation to account for drinking water delivery times and incubation periods of waterborne pathogens. The study period contained 25,659 nurse advice calls relating to gastrointestinal illnesses. Heavy rainfall was associated with increased calls the same day and around 5-6 days later. Consecutive days of wet weather were also found to be associated with an increase in the daily number of gastrointestinal concerns. No associations were identified between precipitation and nurse advice calls relating to other medical concerns. An increase in nurse advice calls relating to gastrointestinal illnesses around 5-6 days after heavy rainfall is consistent with a hypothesis that the cause could be related to drinking water due to insufficient barriers in the drinking water production, suggesting the need for improved drinking water treatment.

  abstract      = {Wood-pastures are complex social-ecological systems (SES), which are the product of long-term interaction between society and its surrounding landscape. Traditionally characterized by multifunctional low-intensity management that enhanced a wide range of ecosystem services (ES), current farm management has shifted toward more intensive farm models. This study assesses the supply of ES in four study areas dominated by managed wood-pastures in Spain, Sweden, and Romania. On the basis of 144 farm surveys and the use of multivariate techniques, we characterize farm management and structure in the study areas and identify the trade-offs in ES supply associated with this management. We link these trade-offs to multiple factors that characterize the landholding: economic, social, environmental, technological, and governance. Finally, we analyze how landholders{\textquoteright} values and perspectives have an effect on management decisions. Results show a differentiated pattern of ES supply in the four study areas. We identified four types of trade-offs in ES supply that appear depending on what is being promoted by the farm management and that are associated with different dimensions of wood-pasture management: productivity-related trade-offs, crop production{\textendash}related trade-offs, multifunctionality-related trade-offs, and farm accessibility{\textendash}related trade-offs. These trade-offs are influenced by complex interactions between the properties of the SES, which have a direct influence on landholders{\textquoteright} perspectives and motivations. The findings of this paper advance the understanding of the dynamics between agroecosystems and society and can inform system-based agricultural and conservation policies.},

In addition to intrinsic differences between regenerative responses of axons in peripheral versus central nervous systems, environmental factors such as glial cells and related molecules in the extracellular matrix (ECM) play an important role in axonal regeneration. Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) are recognized as favorable factors that promote axonal regeneration, while astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS) are not. In this review, we evaluate the roles of Schwann cells and astrocytes in axonal regeneration and examine recent evidence that suggests a dual function of astrocytes in regenerative responses. We also discuss the role of Cdc2 pathways in axonal regeneration, which is commonly activated in Schwann cells and astrocytes. Greater insight on the roles of glial cells in axonal regeneration is key to establishing baseline interventions for improving functional recovery following neural injury.},

Given that both excessive alcohol intake and obesity are of public health interest, the present paper provides an update on the association between alcohol consumption and body weight. In general, recent prospective studies show that light-to-moderate alcohol intake is not associated with adiposity gain while heavy drinking is more consistently related to weight gain. Experimental evidence is also mixed and suggests that moderate intake of alcohol does not lead to weight gain over short follow-up periods. However, many factors can explain the conflicting findings and a better characterization of individuals more likely to gain weight as a result of alcohol consumption is needed. In particular, individuals who frequently drink moderate amounts of alcohol may enjoy a healthier lifestyle in general that may protect them from weight gain. In conclusion, despite the important limitations of current studies, it is reasonable to say that alcohol intake may be a risk factor for obesity in some individuals, likely based on a multitude of factors, some of which are discussed herein.},

Female mating patterns have broad implications for sexual selection1,2, speciation3 and conflicts of interest between the sexes4, and yet they are poorly understood. Matings inevitably have costs5, and for females, the benefits of taking more than one mate are rarely obvious. One possible explanation is that females gain benefits because they can avoid using sperm from genetically incompatible males, or invest less in the offspring of such males6,7. It has been shown that mating with more than one male can increase offspring viability8,9,10,11,12, but we present the first clear demonstration that this occurs because females with several mates avoid the negative effects of genetic incompatibility13. We show that in crickets, the eggs of females that mate only with siblings have decreased hatching success. However, if females mate with both a sibling and a non-sibling they avoid altogether the low egg viability associated with sibling matings. If similar effects occur in other species, inbreeding avoidance may be important in understanding the prevalence of multiple mating.},

Behaviorally, the facilitative role of non-REM (NREM) sleep (primarily slow wave sleep) for declarative but not procedural memory performance in humans has been demonstrated in a number of nocturnal sleep studies. However, subjects in these studies were tested after periods of sleep that contained REM sleep in addition to NREM sleep, and comparison wake groups were subjected to mild sleep deprivation. To add some clarity to the findings of these nocturnal studies, we assessed performance on declarative and procedural memory tasks following a daytime training-retest interval containing either a short nap that included NREM without REM sleep, or wakefulness. Consistent with previous findings we show that, after a comparatively brief sleep episode, subjects that take a nap improve more on a declarative memory task than subjects that stay awake, but that improvement on a procedural memory task is the same regardless of whether subjects take a nap or remain awake. Slow wave sleep was the only sleep parameter to correlate positively with declarative memory improvement. These findings are discussed with reference to the general benefits of napping and within the broader context of a growing literature suggesting a role for NREM-specific physiology for the processing of declarative memory.},

Also known as ascorbic acid, vitamin C is a small carbohydrate molecule first identified in the 1920s by Albert von Szent Gy{\"{o}}rgyi, who discovered that it was able to prevent and cure scurvy. Scurvy is a pathological life-threatening condition suffered by people who do not have access to fruits or vegetables for long periods of time. A decade earlier, Kazimierz Funk had prepared a list of nutritional factors, called vitamins, whose deficiencies cause severe diseases in humans. In his list, Funk used the letter "C" to designate a factor still unidentified, but known to prevent scurvy. Later on, Szent Gy{\"{o}}rgyi and Haworth chemically identified "C" as ascorbic acid, and named it so because ascorbic means "anti-scurvy." Over the next century, what we now know as vitamin C became one of the most popular drugs in human history.

Why is this molecule so well-known? Apart from its deficiency causing scurvy in humans, vitamin C is also vitally important to other species. Neither animals nor plants can live without vitamin C, and it is therefore surprising that some animals (some fishes and birds, and a few mammals, including guinea pigs and humans) have lost the capability to produce it over the course of evolution. How did this happen?},

Results demonstrate that the proportions of IQ variance attributable to genes and environment vary nonlinearly with SES. The models suggest that in impoverished families, 60\% of the variance in IQ is accounted for by the shared environment, and the contribution of genes is close to zero; in affluent families, the result is almost exactly the reverse. },

  abstract      = {We examined change over time in the reported prevalence of men having sex with men and women having sex with women and acceptance of those behaviors in the nationally representative General Social Survey of U.S. adults (n'sÂ =Â 28,161--33,728, ages 18--96Â years), 1972--2014. The number of U.S. adults who had at least one same-sex partner since age 18 doubled between the early 1990s and early 2010s (from 3.6 to 8.7Â {\%} for women and from 4.5 to 8.2Â {\%} for men). Bisexual behavior (having sex with both male and female partners) increased from 3.1 to 7.7Â {\%}, accounting for much of the rise, with little consistent change in those having sex exclusively with same-sex partners. The increase in same-sex partners was larger for women than for men, consistent with erotic plasticity theory. Attitudes toward same-sex sexual behavior also became substantially more accepting, dÂ =Â .75, between the early 1970s and early 2010s. By 2014, 49Â {\%} of American adults believed that same-sex sexual activity was ``not wrong at all,'' up from 11Â {\%} in 1973 and 13Â {\%} in 1990. Controlling for acceptance reduced, but did not eliminate, the increase in same-sex behavior over time. Mixed effects (hierarchical linear modeling) analyses separating age, time period, and cohort showed that the trends were primarily due to time period. Increases in same-sex sexual behavior were largest in the South and Midwest and among Whites, were mostly absent among Blacks, and were smaller among the religious. Overall, same-sex sexual behavior has become both more common (or at least more commonly reported) and more accepted.},

The percentage who believed premarital sex among adults was ``not wrong at all'' was 29Â {\%} in the early 1970s, 42Â {\%} in the 1980s and 1990s, 49Â {\%} in the 2000s, and 58Â {\%} between 2010 and 2012. Mixed effects (hierarchical linear modeling) analyses separating time period, generation/birth cohort, and age showed that the trend toward greater sexual permissiveness was primarily due to generation. Acceptance of non-marital sex rose steadily between the G.I. generation (born 1901--1924) and Boomers (born 1946--1964), dipped slightly among early Generation X'ers (born 1965--1981), and then rose so that Millennials (also known as Gen Y or Generation Me, born 1982--1999) were the most accepting of non-marital sex. Number of sexual partners increased steadily between the G.I.s and 1960s-born GenX'ers and then dipped among Millennials to return to Boomer levels. The largest changes appeared among White men, with few changes among Black Americans.

  abstract      = {Backround: Isokinetic eccentric training of the wrist extensors has recently been shown to be effective in treating chronic lateral epicondylosis. However, isokinetic dynamometry is not widely available or practical for daily exercise prescription. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of a novel eccentric wrist extensor exercise added to standard treatment for chronic lateral epicondylosis. Materials and methods: Twenty-one patients with chronic unilateral lateral epicondylosis were random- ized into an eccentric training group (n 1⁄4 11, 6 men, 5 women; age 47 Æ 2 yr) and a Standard Treatment Group (n 1⁄4 10, 4 men, 6 women; age 51 Æ 4 yr). DASH questionnaire, VAS, tenderness measurement, and wrist and middle finger extension were recorded at baseline and after the treatment period. Results: Groups did not differ in terms of duration of symptoms (Eccentric 6 Æ 2 mo vs Standard 8 Æ 3 mos., P 1⁄4 .7), number of physical therapy visits (9 Æ 2 vs 10 Æ 2, P 1⁄4 .81) or duration of treatment (7.2 Æ 0.8 wk vs 7.0 Æ 0.6 wk, P 1⁄4 .69). Improvements in all dependent variables were greater for the Eccentric Group versus the Standard Treatment Group (percent improvement reported): DASH 76% vs 13%, P 1⁄4 .01; VAS 81% vs 22%, P 1⁄4 .002, tenderness 71% vs 5%, P 1⁄4 .003; strength (wrist and middle finger extension combined) 79% vs 15%, P 1⁄4 .011. Discussion: All outcome measures for chronic lateral epicondylosis were markedly improved with the addition of an eccentric wrist extensor exercise to standard physical therapy. This novel exercise, using an inexpensive rubber bar, provides a practical means of adding isolated eccentric training to the treatment of chronic lateral epicondylosis.

  abstract      = {The fossil record demonstrates that mammals re-entered the marine realm on at least seven separate occasions. Five of these clades are still extant, whereas two are extinct. This review presents a brief introduction to the phylogeny of each group of marine mammals, based on the latest studies using both morphological and molecular data. Evolutionary highlights are presented, focusing on changes affecting the sensory systems, locomotion, breathing, feeding, and reproduction in Cetacea, Sirenia, Desmostylia, and Pinnipedia. Aquatic adaptations are specifically cited, supported by data from morphological and geochemical studies. For example, analysis of oxygen isotopes incorporated into fossil tooth enamel indicates whether these mammals foraged in (and, therefore, ingested) fresh water or sea water. Comparisons between groups are made to see if there are any common patterns, particularly relating to adaptations to aquatic life. Results show that aquatic characteristics evolved in mosaic patterns and that different morphological solutions to aquatic conditions were achieved separately in each of these groups. Changes in the axial and appendicular skeleton assist with locomotion for aquatic foraging. Nostril and eye placement modifications accommodate wading versus underwater foraging needs. All groups exhibit aquatic adaptations directly related to feeding, particularly changes in the dentition and rostrum. The earliest representatives of these clades all show morphological features that indicate they were feeding while in the water, suggesting that feeding ecology is a key factor in the evolution of marine mammals.

Review:
Anger inte koncentrationen av bakterier i vattnet


Arbetet ser ok ut, Det jag hade fr{\r{a}}gat efter om jag varit handledare {\"{a}}r en diskussion om problemen med att anv{\"{a}}nda E. coli som indikator (misst{\"{a}}nker t.ex. att att de halterna var ok hela tiden i {\"{O}}stersund f{\"{o}}r n{\r{a}}gra {\r{a}}r sedan...), samt n{\r{a}}gon form av test av varf{\"{o}}r filterna {\"{a}}ndrade funktionsgrad under anv{\"{a}}ndning. Min f{\"{o}}rsta tanke var att materialet m{\"{o}}jligen packats under anv{\"{a}}ndning vilket borde p{\r{a}}verka dess egenskaper. Detta kan man t{\"{a}}mligen l{\"{a}}tt testa. Hans metod med burktoppen p{\r{a}} toppen verkar bra, men ger m{\"{o}}jligheter att skapa oj{\"{a}}mna fl{\"{o}}den och bildning av kanaler i mediet: jag hade velat testa ett gruslager (t.ex. 2-3 cm ca 2-4 mm grus) f{\"{o}}r att f{\r{a}} ett j{\"{a}}mnare fl{\"{o}}de genom mediet. 

Om man misst{\"{a}}nker att det {\"{a}}r mediet som {\"{a}}r kontaminansk{\"{a}}lla kan man testa att koka det. Lite opraktiskt att beh{\"{o}}va koka sitt vattenfilter, men ett bra s{\"{a}}tt att testa/verifiera om det {\"{a}}r mediet som avger bakterier eller om det "bara" sl{\"{a}}pper igenom det. Jag skulle vilja testa att tillverka ett filter med kokt eller autoklaverat medium, samt att packa det ordentligt samt att se till att minimera bildningen av kanaler i mediet genom att ha ett bra skydd p{\r{a}} toppen. Samt att sedan aldrig l{\r{a}}ta mediet torka ut (d{\r{a}} blir det alltid kanaler i "pulvermedier"). Inte f{\"{a}}ltm{\"{a}}ssigt att skapa ett filter p{\r{a}} det s{\"{a}}ttet, men det skulle vara skoj att testa det "optimala" kol-torvfiltret.},

  abstract      = {Water hemlock, Cicuta virosa, belonging to the Umbelliferae, is well-known as a toxic plant responsible for lethal poisonings in humans as well as animals, causing tonic and clonic convulsions and respiratory paralysis. Cicutoxin (1), being a major violent toxin of the plant, is a chemical in the class of C(17)-polyacetylenes bearing a long pi-bond conjugation system, a terminal hydroxyl, and an allylic hydroxyl in its structure, and a variety of its analogues have been isolated from the plant. In the present study, various derivatives of these toxins were synthesized through acetylation, methylation, and oxidation of cicutoxin (1) and virol A (3) and B (4). 1-Dehydroxyvirol A (28) was prepared through the coupling of (7S)-dodeca-3,5-dien-1-yn-7-ol and 1-iodopentyne under Sonogashira's conditions. A monoacetylenic compound (29) was also prepared through the coupling of (5S)-1-chlorodeca-1,3-dien-5-ol and 1-iodopentyn-5-ol. The structure-activity relationships involved in the acute toxicity of cicutoxin derivatives in mice were investigated, and the length and geometry of pi-bond conjugation and the O-functional groups were found to be important for activity. The potency in inhibition of the specific binding of the noncompetitive GABA antagonist, [(3)H]EBOB, to GABA-gated Cl(-) channels of GABA receptors in rat brain cortex was found to be correlated with acute toxicity, indicating that the ability to bind to these channels plays an important role in the acute toxicity of these compounds.},

  abstract      = {AbstractBackground Daily habits, including the number and quality of eating occasions, are potential targets for primary prevention strategies with large health impacts. Skipping breakfast is considered a frequent and unhealthy habit associated with an increased cardiovascular (CV) risk. Objectives The study sought to explore the association between different breakfast patterns and \{CV\} risk factors and the presence, distribution, and extension of subclinical atherosclerosis. Methods Cross-sectional analysis was performed within the \{PESA\} (Progression of Early Subclinical Atherosclerosis) study, a prospective cohort of asymptomatic (free of \{CV\} events at baseline) adults 40 to 54 years of age. Lifestyle and multivascular imaging data along with clinical covariates were collected from 4,052 participants. Multivariate logistic regression models were used in the analysis. Results Three patterns of breakfast consumption were studied: high-energy breakfast, when contributing to &gt;20% of total daily energy intake (27% of the population); low-energy breakfast, when contributing between 5% and 20% of total daily energy intake (70% of the population); and skipping breakfast, when consumingÂ &lt;5% of total daily energy (3% of the population). Independent of the presence of traditional and dietary \{CV\} risk factors, and compared with high-energy breakfast, habitual skipping breakfast was associated with a higher prevalence of noncoronary (odds ratio: 1.55; 95% confidence interval: 0.97 to 2.46) and generalized (odds ratio: 2.57; 95% confidence interval: 1.54 to 4.31) atherosclerosis. Conclusion Skipping breakfast is associated with an increased odds of prevalent noncoronary and generalized atherosclerosis independently of the presence of conventional \{CV\} risk factors.

al ’ s characteristics and the environment, as well as by the
nature of the task and the amount of practice at it. Mental
performance tests range in complexity and include subjective
estimates of mood, simple objective tests (reaction time), and
measures of complex performance that require decisions to be
made and priorities set. Mental performance tasks show 2
components, a circadian rhythm and the effects of time awake.
The circadian rhythm is in phase with the rhythm of core tem-
perature and there is evidence for a causal link. Increasing time
awake results in performance deterioration and is attributed
to fatigue. The relative contribution of these 2 components de-
pends upon the task under consideration; simple tasks gener-
ally show smaller effects due to increasing time awake. These
contributions have been assessed by constant routines and
forced desynchronization protocols and have formed the basis
of several mathematical models that attempt to predict per-
formance in a variety of fi eld conditions. Mental performance
is negatively affected by sleep loss; although short naps are
benefi cial, sleep inertia limits their value immediately after
waking. The processes involved in cognition include attention
(tonic and phasic alertness, and selective and sustained atten-
tion), working memory (phonological, used for speech, read-
ing, and writing; and visuospatial, used for spatial processing,
drawing, and mathematics), and executive function (initia-
tive, decision making, and problem solving). These processes
are illuminated by analysis of the regions of the brain involved,
the presence of circadian rhythmicity, and the effects of sleep
loss. The results from such laboratory- and fi eld-based obser-
vations are relevant to the issue of learning in schoolchildren
and lead to suggestions for improving their performance.},

This review sought to find the origin of this advice (called {\textquotedblleft}8 {\texttimes} 8{\textquotedblright} for short) and to examine the scientific evidence, if any, that might support it. The search included not only electronic modes but also a cursory examination of the older literature that is not covered in electronic databases and, most importantly and fruitfully, extensive consultation with several nutritionists who specialize in the field of thirst and drinking fluids. No scientific studies were found in support of 8 {\texttimes} 8. Rather, surveys of food and fluid intake on thousands of adults of both genders, analyses of which have been published in peer-reviewed journals, strongly suggest that such large amounts are not needed because the surveyed persons were presumably healthy and certainly not overtly ill. This conclusion is supported by published studies showing that caffeinated drinks (and, to a lesser extent, mild alcoholic beverages like beer in moderation) may indeed be counted toward the daily total, as well as by the large body of published experiments that attest to the precision and effectiveness of the osmoregulatory system for maintaining water balance.

However, if vulnerability to harvest depends upon female reproductive status, patterns of selectivity could diverge and favor alternative reproductive behaviors. Here, using more than 20 years of detailed data on survival and reproduction in a hunted large carnivore population, we show that protecting females with dependent young, a widespread hunting regulation, provides a survival benefit to females providing longer maternal care. This survival gain compensates for the femalesâ reduced reproductive output, especially at high hunting pressure, where the fitness benefit of prolonged periods of maternal care outweighs that of shorter maternal care. Our study shows that hunting regulation can indirectly promote slower life histories by modulating the fitness benefit of maternal care tactics. We provide empirical evidence that harvest regulation can induce artificial selection on female life history traits and affect demographic processes.},

Most of the cold injuries in real life, however, occur in the foot in cold air rather than in the hand in cold water. Therefore, an experiment was conducted to investigate the within-subject relation between CIVD in the fingers and toes exposed to cold water and cold air. Methods: In 4 experimental sessions, 11 healthy male subjects immersed their toes and fingers in 5°C water and exposed the fingers and toes to −18°C cold air for 30 min. The pad temperature of the middle three digits was measured. Results: CIVD in water was more pronounced in the fingers (onset time 5.1 ± 1.8 min; amplitude 5.0 ± 2.1°C) than in the toes (onset time 10.6 ± 6.0 min; amplitude 3.0 ± 1.0°C). Out of 22 skin temperature responses to cold air, 13 were not identifiable as CIVD. The mean skin temperatures for fingers and toes during the last 20 min of cold exposure were 25.6 ± 7.1°C and 20.9 ± 6.8°C, respectively, for air and 9.3 ± 1.9°C and 7.1 ± 1.3°C for water immersion. There was a strong relation between the mean temperature of the fingers during cold-water immersion and toes during cold air exposure (r = 0.83, P < 0.01), showing that a weak CIVD response in the hand is related to a weak response in the foot. Discussion: We conclude that the cold-water finger immersion test is related to the temperature response in the toes and may thus continue to serve as a valid indicator for the risk of local cold injuries.},

The intertidal flats of the Dutch Wadden Sea are a State Nature Monument and are protected under the Ramsar convention and the European Union's Habitat and Birds Directives. Until 2004, the Dutch government granted permission for ~75% of the intertidal flats to be exploited by mechanical dredgers for edible cockles (Cerastoderma edule). Here we show that dredged areas belonged to the limited area of intertidal flats that were of sufficient quality for red knots (Calidris canutus islandica), a long-distance migrant molluscivore specialist, to feed. Dredging led to relatively lower settlement rates of cockles and also reduced their quality (ratio of flesh to shell). From 1998 to 2002, red knots increased gizzard mass to compensate for a gradual loss in shellfish quality, but this compensation was not sufficient and led to decreases in local survival. Therefore, the gradual destruction of the necessary intertidal resources explains both the loss of red knots from the Dutch Wadden Sea and the decline of the European wintering population. This study shows that MPAs that do not provide adequate protection from fishing may fail in their conservation objectives.},

  abstract      = {Summary Circadian rhythms in health and disease have most often been described
in terms of their phases and amplitudes, and how these respond to a single exposure
to stimuli denoted as zeitgebers. The present paper argues that it is also important
to consider the 24-h regularity in the repeated occurrence of the zeitgebers. The
effect of the regularity of stimulation by light, melatonin, physical activity, body
temperature, corticosteroids and feeding on synchronization within and between
the central circadian clock and peripheral oscillators is discussed. In contrast to the
phase shifts that can be recorded acutely after a single zeitgeber pulse, the effects
of irregularly versus regularly timed zeitgeber can be studied only in long-term
protocols and may develop slowly, which is a possible reason why they have received
relatively little attention. Several observations indicate a reciprocal relation
between the robustness of the endogenous circadian timing system and its
dependency on regularly timed zeitgebers. Especially at old age and in disease,
proper functioning of the circadian timing system may become more dependent on
regularly timed exposure to zeitgeber stimuli. in such conditions, regularly timed
exposure to zeitgeber appears to be highly important for health. After a concise
introduction on inputs to the central and peripheral oscillators of the circadian
timing system, the paper discusses the responses of the circadian timing system and
health to (1) a chronic lack of zeitgeber stimuli; (2) fragmented or quasi-ultradian
stimuli and (3) repeated phase shifts in stimuli. Subsequently, the specific relevance
to aging is discussed, followed by an overview of the effects of experimentally
imposed regularly timed stimuli. Finally, a possible mechanism for the gradually
evolving effects of repeated regularly timed stimuli on the circadian timing system is
proposed.

(MT) influences information processing in a working
memory task with complex visual stimuli. Participants
were tested before (T1) and after (T2) participation in an
intensive one-month MT retreat, and their performance was
compared with that of an age- and education-matched
control group. Accuracy did not differ across groups at
either time point. Response times were faster and significantly
less variable in the MT versus the control group at T2. Since
these results could be due to changes in mnemonic processes,
speed–accuracy trade-off, or nondecisional factors (e.g.,
motor execution), we used a mathematical modeling approach
to disentangle these factors. The EZ-diffusion model
(Wagenmakers, van der Maas, & Grasman, Psychonomic
Bulletin & Review 14:(1), 3–22, 2007) suggested that
MT leads to improved information quality and reduced
response conservativeness, with no changes in nondeci-
sional factors. The noisy exemplar model further sug-
gested that the increase in information quality reflected a
decrease in encoding noise and not an increase in
forgetting. Thus, mathematical modeling may help clarify
the mechanisms by which MT produces salutary effects on
performance.

They share, to a greater or lesser degree, the same side effects, including gastric and renal toxicity. Recent research has shown that there are at least two COX isoenzymes. COX-1 is constitutive and makes PGs that protect the stomach and kidney from damage. COX-2 is induced by inflammatory stimuli, such as cytokines, and produces PGs that contribute to the pain and swelling of inflammation. Thus, selective COX-2 inhibitors should be anti-inflammatory without side effects on the kidney and stomach. Of course, selective COX-2 inhibitors may have other side effects and perhaps other therapeutic potential. For instance, COX-2 (and not COX-1) is thought to be involved in ovulation and in labor. In addition, the well-known protective action of aspirin on colon cancer may be through an action on COX-2, which is expressed in this disease. Moreover, NSAIDs delay the progress of Alzheimer's disease. Thus, selective COX-2 inhibitors may demonstrate new important therapeutic benefits as anticancer agents, as well as in preventing premature labor and perhaps even retarding the progression of Alzheimer's disease. },

Results Nomograms for flaccid pendulous [n = 10â704, mean (sd) 9.16â(1.57)âcm] and stretched length [n = 14â160, mean (sd) 13.24â(1.89)âcm], erect length [n = 692, mean (sd) 13.12â(1.66)âcm], flaccid circumference [n = 9407, mean (sd) 9.31â(0.90)âcm], and erect circumference [n = 381, mean (sd) 11.66â(1.10)âcm] were constructed. Consistent and strongest significant correlation was between flaccid stretched or erect length and height, which ranged from r = 0.2 to 0.6. Limitations: relatively few erect measurements were conducted in a clinical setting and the greatest variability between studies was seen with flaccid stretched length. Conclusions Penis size nomograms may be useful in clinical and therapeutic settings to counsel men and for academic research.},

The effects of ketone body metabolism suggests that mild ketosis may offer therapeutic potential in a variety of different common and rare disease states. These inferences follow directly from the metabolic effects of ketosis and the higher inherent energy present in d-beta-hydroxybutyrate relative to pyruvate, the normal mitochondrial fuel produced by glycolysis leading to an increase in the DeltaG' of ATP hydrolysis. The large categories of disease for which ketones may have therapeutic effects are:(1)diseases of substrate insufficiency or insulin resistance,(2)diseases resulting from free radical damage,(3)disease resulting from hypoxia. Current ketogenic diets are all characterized by elevations of free fatty acids, which may lead to metabolic inefficiency by activation of the PPAR system and its associated uncoupling mitochondrial uncoupling proteins. New diets comprised of ketone bodies themselves or their esters may obviate this present difficulty.},

Setting Webâbased questionnaire. Population The adult offspring (F2) of a cohort of men and women (F1) born around the time of the 1944â45 Dutch famine. Methods We approached the F2 adults through their parents. Participating F2 adults (nÂ =Â 360, mean age 37Â years) completed an online questionnaire. Main outcome measures Weight, body mass index (BMI), and health in F2 adults, according to F1 prenatal famine exposure. Results Adult offspring (F2) of prenatally exposed F1 fathers had higher weights and BMIs than offspring of prenatally unexposed F1 fathers (+4.9Â kg, PÂ =Â 0.03; +1.6Â kg/mÂ², PÂ =Â 0.006). No such effect was found for the F2 offspring of prenatally exposed F1 mothers. We observed no differences in adult health between the F2 generation groups. Conclusions Offspring of prenatally undernourished fathers, but not mothers, were heavier and more obese than offspring of fathers and mothers who had not been undernourished prenatally. We found no evidence of transgenerational effects of grandmaternal underânutrition during gestation on the health of this relatively young group, but the increased adiposity in the offspring of prenatally undernourished fathers may lead to increased chronic disease rates in the future.},

during periods of equilibration, starvation and
refeeding. During 3 days of fasting, a mean
daily weight loss of 800 g was accompanied by
progressive natriuresis and kaliuresis without
increase in urine volume. The net amount of
sodium excreted as a consequence of fasting was
independent of the amount of sodium supple- mented. Carbohydrate refeeding induces very
rapid antidiuresis of sodium and potassium. Protein
has a delayed action, while fat refeeding ag- gravates the negative sodium balance. The so- dium retaining action of carbohydrate requires a
pre-existing metabolic setting induced by starva- tion. Bicarbonate supplementation during fast- ing does not alter the pattern of sodium excre- tion. The data suggest that the sodium retaining
action of carbohydrate after brief starvation is
not secondary to aldosterone, glucocorticoste- roids or changes in catecholamine levels. (J Clin

Results were combined across the two datasets.Results 5062 cases of venous thromboembolism from CPRD and 5500 from QResearch were analysed. Current exposure to any combined oral contraceptive was associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (adjusted odds ratio 2.97, 95\% confidence interval 2.78 to 3.17) compared with no exposure in the previous year. Corresponding risks associated with current exposure to desogestrel (4.28, 3.66 to 5.01), gestodene (3.64, 3.00 to 4.43), drospirenone (4.12, 3.43 to 4.96), and cyproterone (4.27, 3.57 to 5.11) were significantly higher than those for second generation contraceptives levonorgestrel (2.38, 2.18 to 2.59) and norethisterone (2.56, 2.15 to 3.06), and for norgestimate (2.53, 2.17 to 2.96).

Cardiovascular and hormonal aspects of very-lowcarbohydrate
ketogenic diets. Obes Res. 2004;12:
115S–123S.
In recent years, restriction of carbohydrate intake for weight
loss has become widespread. Our research group began
studying physiological responses to very-low-carbohydrate
ketogenic diets (VLCKDs) in the late 1990s because we felt
there was a significant void in the literature and limited
understanding of metabolic responses to VLCKDs. This
launched us into a line of research examining the physiological
effects of VLCKDs. In this paper, we briefly overview
nine studies we have published on isoenergetic and
hypoenergetic VLCKDs in men and women. These studies
have focused on blood lipid responses to VLCKDs, but we
have also addressed changes in body weight, body composition,
and hormones. Compared with low-fat diets, shortterm
VLCKDs consistently result in improvements in fat
loss, fasting and postprandial triacylglycerols, high-density
lipoprotein-cholesterol, the distribution of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol
subclasses, and insulin resistance.
These are the key metabolic abnormalities of metabolic
syndrome, a problem of epidemic proportions in the United
States. There is substantial variability in total cholesterol
and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol responses to
VLCKD. The factors responsible for this variability are not
known, and studies designed to identify methods to predict
blood lipid responses to VLCKD and other dietary approaches
represent critical areas for nutrition researchers.
Further research is warranted to validate the physiological
effects of VLCKD over longer periods of time, including
studies that modify the quality of macronutrients
(i.e., the type of fat and protein) and the interaction with
other interventions (e.g., exercise, dietary supplements,
drugs).

  abstract      = {Although considerable progress has been made in understanding the genetic basis of morphologic traits (for example, body size and coat color) in dogs and wolves, the genetic basis of their behavioral divergence is poorly understood. An integrative approach using both behavioral and genetic data is required to understand the molecular underpinnings of the various behavioral characteristics associated with domestication. We analyze a 5-Mb genomic region on chromosome 6 previously found to be under positive selection in domestic dog breeds. Deletion of this region in humans is linked to Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS), a multisystem congenital disorder characterized by hypersocial behavior. We associate quantitative data on behavioral phenotypes symptomatic of WBS in humans with structural changes in the WBS locus in dogs. We find that hypersociability, a central feature of WBS, is also a core element of domestication that distinguishes dogs from wolves. We provide evidence that structural variants in GTF2I and GTF2IRD1, genes previously implicated in the behavioral phenotype of patients with WBS and contained within the WBS locus, contribute to extreme sociability in dogs. This finding suggests that there are commonalities in the genetic architecture of WBS and canine tameness and that directional selection may have targeted a unique set of linked behavioral genes of large phenotypic effect, allowing for rapid behavioral divergence of dogs and wolves, facilitating coexistence with humans.},

  abstract      = { 1-Propanol and 2-propanol are isomers of an alcohol with three carbons. They are colorless liquids with a sweet odor. 1-Propanol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase to propionic acid and presents with metabolic acidosis and elevated anion gap, whereas 2-propanol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase to acetone and presents with rapidly developing (within 3â4Â h after exposure) ketosis and ketonuria but without metabolic acidosis. We report a patient who simultaneously ingested a lethal dose of 1-propanol and 2-propanol as a hand disinfectant in hospital. The patient lost consciousness and stopped breathing within half an hour after ingestion. He was intubated and artificially ventilated. Initial laboratory results showed mixed acidosis with elevated anion gap, but ketonuria appeared only 12Â h after admission and 6Â h following the regaining of consciousness. Therefore, laboratory results in simultaneous poisoning with two isomers of alcohol are not just a sum of laboratory results obtained in isolated poisoning with each isomer because they influence each otherâs metabolism: 1-propanol retards the metabolism of 2-propanol to acetone. In conclusion, 1-propanol and 2-propanol poisoning presents early with mixed acidosis and elevated anion gap and only later with ketonuria. },

When survival depends on mutual assistance, the expression of aggression is constrained by the need to maintain beneficial relationships. Moreover, evolution has produced ways of countering its disruptive consequences. For example, chimpanzees kiss and embrace after fights, and other nonhuman primates engage in similar "reconciliations." Theoretical developments in this field carry implications for human aggression research. From families to high schools, aggressive conflict is subject to the same constraints known of cooperative animal societies. It is only when social relationships are valued that one can expect the full complement of natural checks and balances},

furthermore, increased the actual and the total activity in liver and kidney, without a

  abstract      = {Objective. To review case reports of statin-associated memory loss as well as the available published evidence for and against such a link. Methods. We searched the MedWatch drug surveillance system of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from November 1997–February 2002 for reports of statin-associated memory loss. We also reviewed the published literature (using MEDLINE) and prescribing information for these drugs. Results. Of the 60 patients identified who had memory loss associated with statins, 36 received simvastatin, 23 atorvastatin, and 1 pravastatin. About 50% of the patients noted cognitive adverse effects within 2 months of therapy. Fourteen (56%) of 25 patients noted improvement when the statin was discontinued. Memory loss recurred in four patients who were rechallenged with the drug. None of the 60 reported cognitive test results. Two placebo-controlled trials found no benefits for statins on cognition or disability. One randomized controlled trial of simvastatin found no effects on cerebrospinal amyloid levels. In one small, randomized study, patients receiving statins showed a trend toward lower cognitive performance than those receiving placebo. Five observational studies found a lower risk of dementia among patients receiving statins. Conclusion. Current literature is conflicting with regard to the effects of statins on memory loss. Experimental studies support links between cholesterol intake and amyloid synthesis; observational studies indicate that patients receiving statins have a reduced risk of dementia. However, available prospective studies show no cognitive or antiamyloid benefits for any statin. In addition, case reports raise the possibility that statins, in rare cases, may be associated with cognitive impairment, though causality is not certain. (Pharmacotherapy 2003;23(7):871–880)},

To investigate the association between serum sodium concentration and mortality, we conducted a prospective cohort study of 98,411 adults hospitalized between 2000 and 2003 at 2 teaching hospitals in Boston, Massachusetts. The main outcome measures were in-hospital, 1-year, and 5-year mortality. Multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare outcomes in patients with varying degrees of hyponatremia against those with normal serum sodium concentration. Hyponatremia (serum sodium concentration <135 mEq/L) was observed in 14.5% of patients on initial measurement. Compared with patients with normonatremia (135-144 mEq/L), those with hyponatremia were older (67.0 vs 63.1 years, P <.001) and had more comorbid conditions (mean Deyo-Charlson Index 1.9 vs 1.4, P <.001). In multivariable-adjusted models, patients with hyponatremia had an increased risk of death in hospital (odds ratio 1.47, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.33-1.62), at 1 year (hazard ratio 1.38, 95% CI, 1.32-1.46), and at 5 years (hazard ratio 1.25, 95% CI, 1.21-1.30). The increased risk of death was evident even in those with mild hyponatremia (130-134 mEq/L; odds ratio 1.37, 95% CI, 1.23-1.52). The relationship between hyponatremia and mortality was pronounced in patients admitted with cardiovascular disease, metastatic cancer, and those admitted for procedures related to the musculoskeletal system. Resolution of hyponatremia during hospitalization attenuated the increased mortality risk conferred by hyponatremia. Hyponatremia, even when mild, is associated with increased mortality.},

A critical determinant of success in achieving these goals is the financing that is committed to maintaining biodiversity6,7,8,9; however, financing decisions are hindered by considerable uncertainty over the likely impact of any conservation investment6,7,8,9. For greater effectiveness, we need an evidence-based model10,11,12 that shows how conservation spending quantitatively reduces the rate of biodiversity loss. Here we demonstrate such a model, and empirically quantify how conservation investment between 1996 and 2008 reduced biodiversity loss in 109 countries (signatories to the Convention on Biological Diversity and Sustainable Development Goals), by a median average of 29% per country. We also show that biodiversity changes in signatory countries can be predicted with high accuracy, using a dual model that balances the effects of conservation investment against those of economic, agricultural and population growth (human development pressures)13,14,15,16,17,18. Decision-makers can use this model to forecast the improvement that any proposed biodiversity budget would achieve under various scenarios of human development pressure, and then compare these forecasts to any chosen policy target. We find that the impact of spending decreases as human development pressures grow, which implies that funding may need to increase over time. The model offers a flexible tool for balancing the Sustainable Development Goals of human development and maintaining biodiversity, by predicting the dynamic changes in conservation finance that will be needed as human development proceeds.},

This review will consider recent and emerging findings implicating sleep and specific sleep-stage physiologies in the modulation, regulation, and even preparation of cognitive and emotional brain processes. First, evidence for the role of sleep in memory processing will be discussed, principally focusing on declarative memory. Second, at a neural level several mechanistic models of sleep-dependent plasticity underlying these effects will be reviewed, with a synthesis of these features offered that may explain the ordered structure of sleep, and the orderly evolution of memory stages. Third, accumulating evidence for the role of sleep in associative memory processing will be discussed, suggesting that the long-term goal of sleep may not be the strengthening of individual memory items, but, instead, their abstracted assimilation into a schema of generalized knowledge. Fourth, the newly emerging benefit of sleep in regulating emotional brain reactivity will be considered. Finally, and building on this latter topic, a novel hypothesis and framework of sleep-dependent affective brain processing will be proposed, culminating in testable predictions and translational implications for mood disorders.},

  abstract      = {Abstract Improvement in motor skill performance is known to continue for at least 24 hr following training, yet the relative contributions of time spent awake and asleep are unknown. Here we provide evidence that a night of sleep results in a 20% increase in motor speed without loss of accuracy, while an equivalent period of time during wake provides no significant benefit. Furthermore, a significant correlation exists between the improved performance overnight and the amount of stage 2 NREM sleep, particularly late in the night. This finding of sleep-dependent motor skill improvement may have important implications for the efficient learning of all skilled actions in humans.},

A large number of studies offer a substantive body of evidence supporting this role of sleep in what is becoming known as sleep-dependent memory processing. This review will provide evidence of sleep-dependent memory consolidation and sleep-dependent brain plasticity and is divided into five sections: (1) an overview of sleep stages, memory categories, and the distinct stages of memory development; (2) a review of the specific relationships between sleep and memory, both in humans and animals; (3) a survey of evidence describing sleep-dependent brain plasticity, including human brain imaging studies as well as animal studies of cellular neurophysiology and molecular biology. We close (4) with a consideration of unanswered questions as well as existing arguments against the role of sleep in learning and memory and (5) a concluding summary.},

Bara n{\r{a}}gra f{\r{a}} bitar av m{\"{o}}rk choklad kan g{\"{o}}ra en mindre hund sjuk. En hel chokladkaka kan ge en d{\"{o}}dlig f{\"{o}}rgiftning. Bland det sk{\"{o}}naste med helgen {\"{a}}r de stunder man slipper alla m{\r{a}}sten. Och att f{\r{a}} stiga upp tidigt och larva omkring i skogen. G{\r{a}} en sv{\"{a}}ng till sj{\"{o}}n. Stanna och titta, lyssna i den stilla, kalla gryningen. F{\"{o}}lja ett sp{\r{a}}r i sn{\"{o}}n. Komma tillbaka innan grannarna vaknat. S{\"{a}}tta p{\r{a}} kaffe. Det {\"{a}}r s{\r{a}} tyst om mornarna en riktigt storhelg. Men denna julaftons morgon har grannarna ocks{\r{a}} varit p{\r{a}} benen. Sp{\r{a}}ren mellan husen skvallrar. De kommer in genom grinden och g{\r{a}}r rakt {\"{o}}ver g{\r{a}}rden, fram till ytterd{\"{o}}rren. Det st{\r{a}}r ett stort platt paket p{\r{a}} trappan. En chokladask, stor som en frukostbricka! Med k{\"{a}}ngorna fortfarande p{\r{a}} och likas{\r{a}} jackan sl{\"{a}}nger jag vantarna p{\r{a}} golvet, sliter av allt papper och fl{\"{a}}ker upp det stora locket. H{\"{a}}r blir det provsmakning omedelbart. Efter ett par timmars morgonpromenad p{\r{a}} fastande mage {\"{a}}r det inte tal om att v{\"{a}}nta. Jag v{\"{a}}ljer bland m{\r{a}}nga sorter. Den d{\"{a}}r brukar vara n{\"{o}}tter i... S{\r{a}} f{\r{a}}r jag syn p{\r{a}} grannen genom f{\"{o}}nstret, st{\"{a}}ller ifr{\r{a}}n mig asken och kilar ut f{\"{o}}r att tacka. Malin st{\r{a}}r p{\r{a}} bordet n{\"{a}}r jag kommer tillbaka. Hon viftar malligt p{\r{a}} svansen och hela bakkroppen gungar. {\"{O}}ronen st{\r{a}}r rakt ut ? som alltid n{\"{a}}r en spaniel kopplat p{\r{a}} stora charmen. Hon kisar lyckligt och drar upp l{\"{a}}pparna i ett stort, saligt flin. Munnen {\"{a}}r kladdig av choklad och ett papper har fastnat p{\r{a}} nosknappen. {\"{O}}ver hela bordet ligger f{\"{a}}rgglada foliepapper och alla de inslagna men demolerade bitar som hon {\"{a}}nnu inte lyckats {\"{o}}ppna. Sent p{\r{a}} julaftonens kv{\"{a}}ll f{\"{o}}rs{\"{o}}ker m{\"{a}}nniskor och hundar hitta en st{\"{a}}llning d{\"{a}}r magen k{\"{a}}nns mindre spr{\"{a}}ngfull. M{\"{a}}nniskorna halvligger i varsin f{\r{a}}t{\"{o}}lj. Hundar med putande magar snarkar h{\"{o}}gljutt under bordet. Men inte Malin. Malin ligger vid ytterd{\"{o}}rren och f{\"{o}}rs{\"{o}}ker gr{\"{a}}va sig ut mellan d{\"{o}}rren och fodret. Hon gn{\"{a}}ller, kommer och h{\"{a}}mtar, skall visa, blir utsl{\"{a}}ppt, sk{\"{a}}ller rakt ut i m{\"{o}}rkret. Blir inkallad och b{\"{o}}rjar om igen, gr{\"{a}}ver vid d{\"{o}}rren, kommer och h{\"{a}}mtar och s{\r{a}} upprepas hela skeendet g{\r{a}}ng p{\r{a}} g{\r{a}}ng. Hunden {\"{a}}r manisk. Aldrig har vi sett n{\r{a}}got liknande. Till sist kl{\"{a}}r vi oss och g{\r{a}}r en l{\r{a}}ng promenad. Malin studsar fram. Antingen ser hon i syne eller ocks{\r{a}} {\"{a}}r hela natten full av andar och sp{\"{o}}ken, h{\"{o}}gt och l{\r{a}}gt. Hunden stirrar, hoppar p{\r{a}} bakbenen, springer och muffar och vuffar ut i m{\"{o}}rkret. Till sist begriper vi. Malin {\"{a}}r chokladf{\"{o}}rgiftad. Teobromin Choklad inneh{\r{a}}ller kakao som i sin tur inneh{\r{a}}ller tv{\r{a}} av v{\r{a}}ra n{\"{a}}ra och k{\"{a}}ra stimulantia: teobromin och koffein. Koffein finns framf{\"{o}}r allt i kaffe. I kakao dominerar d{\"{a}}remot teobromin. Kakao inneh{\r{a}}ller tio g{\r{a}}nger mer teobromin {\"{a}}n koffein. Halten av teobromin varierar kraftigt. Ett visst kakaopulver kan inneh{\r{a}}lla fem g{\r{a}}nger s{\r{a}} mycket teobromin som ett annat. M{\"{a}}ngden i ett visst m{\"{a}}rke beror i sin tur p{\r{a}} halten i r{\r{a}}varan (kakaob{\"{o}}nor). Ljus svensk mj{\"{o}}lkchoklad inneh{\r{a}}ller cirka trettio procent kakao medan finare m{\"{o}}rk choklad fr{\r{a}}n Mellaneuropa kan inneh{\r{a}}lla det tredubbla. Inneh{\r{a}}llet av teobromin anges inte p{\r{a}} f{\"{o}}rpackningarna. Doser Teobromin {\"{a}}r giftigt f{\"{o}}r hundar. Choklad tillverkad av ?stark? kakao kan orsaka symtom {\"{a}}ven om hunden bara {\"{a}}ter en ganska liten m{\"{a}}ngd. 20 milligram teobromin per kilo kroppsvikt r{\"{a}}cker f{\"{o}}r att ge f{\"{o}}rgiftning och tiodubbla m{\"{a}}ngden {\"{a}}r d{\"{o}}dlig. {\"{O}}versatt till mer l{\"{a}}ttbegriplig m{\"{a}}ngd inneb{\"{a}}r det att en normalstor (100 gram) ljus chokladkaka kan d{\"{o}}da en dv{\"{a}}rghund och f{\"{o}}rgifta en hund upp till retrieverstorlek. Samma m{\"{a}}ngd av den m{\"{o}}rkaste chokladen kan f{\"{o}}rgifta en hund av vilken storlek som helst ? {\"{a}}ven en sankt bernhardshund. Den kan vara d{\"{o}}dlig f{\"{o}}r en hund av storlek som en cocker spaniel. Upprepad f{\"{o}}rt{\"{a}}ring ger kraftigt {\"{o}}kad risk eftersom hundar bryter ner teobromin l{\r{a}}ngsamt. Arton timmar efter intaget har bara halva m{\"{a}}ngden l{\"{a}}mnat kroppen. Symtom Symtomen p{\r{a}} chokladf{\"{o}}rgiftning {\"{a}}r psykisk oro och rastl{\"{o}}shet, hj{\"{a}}rtklappning och hastig andning. Oron kan {\"{o}}verg{\r{a}} i {\"{o}}veraktivitet, sv{\r{a}}righet att samordna r{\"{o}}relserna, muskeldarrningar, kramp i en eller flera muskler eller kramp i hela kroppen. I {\"{a}}nnu mer allvarliga fall f{\r{a}}r hunden epilepsilika anfall och/eller kan f{\"{o}}rlora medvetandet. Teobromin (liksom kaffe) s{\"{a}}tter fart p{\r{a}} magen och kan orsaka diarré och kr{\"{a}}kning. Teobromin (liksom kaffe) {\"{o}}kar urinproduktionen. Hunden blir kissn{\"{o}}dig, alternativt kan kissa p{\r{a}} sig, och kompenserar den {\"{o}}kade urinavg{\r{a}}ngen genom att dricka mer {\"{a}}n vanligt. Vid misstanke om chokladf{\"{o}}rgiftning b{\"{o}}r veterin{\"{a}}r kontaktas omedelbart. Man b{\"{o}}r f{\"{o}}rs{\"{o}}ka att r{\"{a}}kna ut hur mycket ren choklad hunden {\"{a}}tit och av vilken sort. Ljusa fyllda praliner {\"{a}}r betydligt mindre farliga {\"{a}}n motsvarande m{\"{a}}ngd ren, m{\"{o}}rk choklad fr{\r{a}}n exempelvis Belgien. Behandling Behandlingen inneh{\r{a}}ller flera olika moment. Om intaget nyligen skett f{\"{o}}rs{\"{o}}ker man f{\r{a}} hunden att kr{\"{a}}kas upp chokladen. Ett skrovm{\r{a}}l mat och en samtidig injektion av kr{\"{a}}kmedel kan ge resultat. Om hunden inte har kontroll {\"{o}}ver sv{\"{a}}ljreflexen kan magsk{\"{o}}ljning i narkos {\"{o}}verv{\"{a}}gas men f{\"{o}}rv{\"{a}}ntat resultat m{\r{a}}ste balanseras mot nackdelarna: chokladen kan klumpa ihop sig och vara sv{\r{a}}r att f{\r{a}} upp. Om det redan g{\r{a}}tt s{\r{a}} l{\r{a}}ng tid att chokladen l{\"{a}}mnat mags{\"{a}}cken f{\"{o}}rs{\"{o}}ker man att binda giftet till aktivt kol. Detta ges i munnen i form av kolsuspension ? f{\"{o}}rutsatt att hunden {\"{a}}r s{\r{a}} vaken att den kan sv{\"{a}}lja normalt. Man f{\"{o}}rs{\"{o}}ker {\"{a}}ven minska upptaget av teobromin till blodet fr{\r{a}}n tarmen genom att ge p{\r{a}}drivande medel. Laxering ger en snabbare passage genom tarmen och lavemang stimulerar grovtarmen till att t{\"{o}}mma sig p{\r{a}} avf{\"{o}}ring. Teobromin uts{\"{o}}ndras med urinen. Genom att ge dropp kan man {\"{o}}ka kroppens v{\"{a}}tskevolym och ?tr{\"{a}}nga ut? giftet via njurarna. T{\"{a}}ta bl{\r{a}}st{\"{o}}mningar, alternativt t{\"{o}}mning av urin med kateter, minskar risken f{\"{o}}r {\r{a}}terupptag genom urinbl{\r{a}}sans v{\"{a}}gg. Vid lindriga muskelkramper ges muskelavslappnande medel och vid epilepsilika anfall kan man beh{\"{o}}va s{\"{o}}va hunden helt. Om hj{\"{a}}rtverksamheten {\"{a}}r p{\r{a}}verkad f{\"{o}}ljs den med kontinuerligt EKG. Skadligt h{\"{o}}g hj{\"{a}}rtfrekvens eller oregelbunden hj{\"{a}}rtverksamhet kan efter behov korrigeras med mediciner. Behandlingen kan beh{\"{o}}va p{\r{a}}g{\r{a}} i upp till tre dygn (p{\r{a}} grund av den l{\r{a}}nga uts{\"{o}}ndringstiden). Framtiden En hund som {\"{o}}verlevt en chokladf{\"{o}}rgiftning brukar bli helt {\r{a}}terst{\"{a}}lld. S{\r{a}} blev ocks{\r{a}} v{\r{a}}r Malin som jag ber{\"{a}}ttade om inledningsvis. Hon behandlades ett par dagar och blev helt normal. Hon drog inga slutsatser av f{\"{o}}rgiftningen utan {\"{a}}r fortfarande lika begiven p{\r{a}} choklad},

The aim of the current study was to assess the validity of the interspecies default for toxicokinetics (4.0) for each of the test species (dog, rabbit, rat and mouse), using published data for compounds eliminated by CYP1A2 in humans (caffeine, theobromine, theophylline and paraxanthine). An analysis of the published literature showed that the absorption, bioavailability and route of excretion were generally similar between humans and the test species, for each probe substrate. However, interspecies differences in the route of metabolism, and the enzymes involved in this process, were identified. The magnitude of difference in the internal dose, between species, showed that values for the mouse (10.6) and rat (5.4) exceed the 4.0-fold default, whereas the rabbit (2.6) and dog (1.6) were below this value. This work supports the need to replace the generic default factors by a compound-related value derived from specific, relevant, quantitative data; this would result in more relevant and reliable non-cancer risk assessments.},

  abstract      = {AbstractBackground To understand an effective golf swing, both swing speed and impact precision must be thoroughly and simultaneously examined. The aim of this study was to perform both swing speed test and impact precision test to ascertain what swing type determines an effective impact. Methods Seven golfers from a college team (handicap: 0â12) were recruited to complete a swing speed test and impact precision test using a 5-iron club. A force plate and electromyography (EMG) system were used to collect data in the swing speed test to compare the difference between two motion sequences. High speed video cameras were used to determine the displacement of rotation center for impact precision test. Results The results showed a significant difference (pÂ &lt;Â 0.01) in clubhead speed with different motion sequences and muscle contraction patterns. In the impact precision test, the displacement of the rotation center which defined as the inner center point of the \{C7\} was significantly different (pÂ &lt;Â 0.05) between different ball impacted marks on club face. Conclusion The vertical peak ground reaction force on left foot occurring before impact and the left latissimus dorsi contracting prior to the right pectoralis major represent a superior skill by allowing the club to strike the ball with normal collision at a faster speed. },

  abstract      = {Depression is a condition in which an individual feels lethargic, irritable, and guilty, has difficulty and trouble, no enjoyment in life, mood swings, sometimes suicidal ideation and thoughts, and loss of pleasure in activities. There are hundreds of millions of individuals suffering from major depression disorder all over the world. This leads to a considerable portion of the economy going for treatment as large amounts of money are spent on drugs every year. Pharmaceutical drugs are not very effective and they also have side effects that compound the problem. There are number of studies which shows that omega-3 fatty acids are proving to be very effective against the treatment of major depression disorder and other psychiatric disorders. However, the data regarding the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids in depression treatment are conflicted. This article reviews the recent research showing the relation between omega-3 fatty acids and depression. The roles of the omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment of depression are being studied with increased pace in the last decade due to heightened prevalence of depression. It is emphasized that omega-3 fatty acids have no record of associated side effects, which deserves greater attention for further research.},

Oxygen consumption and skin and rectal temperatures were measured over the period of 1frac12–2 hours of exposure. Comparison of increased metabolic rate with decreasing air temperatures measured in this study is made with similar data on young Norwegians. Bushmen and Europeans respond in a similar manner metabolically to the degree of cold stress experienced. Skin temperatures of the former tend to be lower and metabolism greater than in Europeans. The lower metabolic rate of Europeans is concluded to be due to the greater insulation afforded by their considerably larger subcutaneous fat deposits. These findings on the cold response of Bushmen contrast with those on Australian aborigines in comparable environmental conditions.},

  abstract      = {<p>We present a systematic and quantitative model of huddling penguins. In this mathematical model, each individual penguin in the huddle seeks only to reduce its own heat loss. Consequently, penguins on the boundary of the huddle that are most exposed to the wind move downwind to more sheltered locations along the boundary. In contrast, penguins in the interior of the huddle neither have the space to move nor experience a significant heat loss, and they therefore remain stationary. Through these individual movements, the entire huddle experiences a robust cumulative effect that we identify, describe, and quantify. This mathematical model requires a calculation of the wind flowing around the huddle and of the resulting temperature distribution. Both of these must be recomputed each time an individual penguin moves since the huddle shape changes. Using our simulation results, we find that the key parameters affecting the huddle dynamics are the number of penguins in the huddle, the wind strength, and the amount of uncertainty in the movement of the penguins. Moreover, we find that the lone assumption of individual penguins minimizing their own heat loss results in all penguins having approximately equal access to the warmth of the huddle.</p>},

  abstract      = {The field of perceived exertion has largely concerned itself with the problem of identifying the primary antecedents to this psychophysiological phenomenon. A vast literature has evolved addressing this problem, but it is fraught with contradictions. At this stage a comprehensive theory of perceived exertion does not exist. It is generally accepted that perception of exertion is dominated by physiological determinants. Physiological sensory cues have been separated into 2 categories: local factors (sensations from the working muscles and joints), and central factors (sensations from the cardiopulmonary system). Major reviews in this area generally agree that local factors dominate perception of exertion. Recent work in perceived exertion has placed an emphasis on examining the contributing psychological factors. Research into the psychological factors affecting perceived exertion has been highly fragmented with no apparent theoretical framework as a base. At the same time it is clear that an integration of psychological and physiological variables is required to obtain theoretically meaningful knowledge of this multidimensional construct. The assumed dominance of physiological factors has been challenged by the contention that in field situations, in which a variety of social psychological influences operate, psychological determinants of perceived exertion may be vastly more influential than previously estimated. Identification of the primary determinants of perceived exertion and knowledge of how these factors are integrated is vital for a concrete theory of perceived exertion to evolve.},

Concentrating on children whose mothers had not completed college, we found that an additional minute waited at age 4 predicted a gain of approximately one tenth of a standard deviation in achievement at age 15. But this bivariate correlation was only half the size of those reported in the original studies and was reduced by two thirds in the presence of controls for family background, early cognitive ability, and the home environment. Most of the variation in adolescent achievement came from being able to wait at least 20 s. Associations between delay time and measures of behavioral outcomes at age 15 were much smaller and rarely statistically significant.},

Metabolically healthy obese (MHO) individuals are characterized by having low abdominal adiposity, low inflammation level and low risk of developing metabolic comorbidity. In this study, we hypothesize that cardiorespiratory fitness (fitness) is a determinant factor for the MHO individuals and aim to investigate the associations between fitness, abdominal adiposity and low-grade inflammation within different BMI categories. Method Data from 10,976 individuals from the general population, DANHES 2007â2008, on waist circumference, fitness and C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were analysed using multiple linear and median quantile regressions. Results In men, an inverse association between fitness (+5 mL min-1 kg-1) and waist circumference (-1.45 cm; 95% CI: -1.55 to -1.35 cm; p<0.001), and an inverse association between fitness (+5 mL min-1 kg-1) and hsCRP (-0.22 mg/L; 95% CI: -0.255 to -0.185 mg/L; p<0.001) was found, all independent of BMI. Similarly in women, an inverse association between fitness (+5 mL min-1 kg-1) and waist circumference (-1.15 cm; 95% CI: -1.25 to -1.0 cm; p<0.001), and an inverse association between fitness (+5 mL min-1 kg-1) and hsCRP (-0.26 mg/L; 95% CI: -0.3 to -0.22 mg/L; p<0.001) was found, all independent of BMI. Additionally, significant positive associations between waist circumference and hsCRP were found for both men and women, independently of BMI. Conclusion Fitness was found to be inversely associated with both abdominal adiposity and low-grade inflammation independent of BMI. These data suggest that, in spite of BMI, high fitness levels lead to a reduction in abdominal fat mass and low-grade inflammation.},

When normal individuals were transferred from a conventional 16-h photoperiod to an experimental 10-h photo-period, their sleep episodes expanded and usually divided into two symmetrical bouts, several hours in duration, with a 1â3 h waking interval between them. The durations of nocturnal melatonin secretion and of the nocturnal phase of rising sleepiness (measured in a constant routine protocol) also expanded, indicating that the timing of internal processes that control sleep and melatonin, such as circadian rhythms, had been modified by the change in photoperiod. Previous work suggests that the experimental results could be simulated with dual-oscillators, entrained separately to dawn and dusk, or with a two-process model, having a lowered threshold for sleep-onset during the scotoperiod.},

A theoretical model was proposed to study the relationships among college students' self-regulation, texting during class, sustained attention to classroom learning, and cognitive learning (i.e., grade-oriented academic performance and experience-oriented cognitive learning). Using a cross-sectional survey sample (N=190), structural equation modeling analyses showed that texting during class partially mediates the effect of students' self-regulation on their sustained attention to classroom learning. In addition, students' sustained attention fully mediates the effect of their texting during class on experience-oriented learning. Thus, the results also suggest that self-regulated students are less likely to text during class and are more likely to sustain their attention to classroom learning, which, in turn, facilitates cognitive learning.},

Genetic, shared zoo, and nonshared environmental variance components of the six factors were estimated by regressing squared phenotypic differences of all possible pairs of chimpanzees onto 1 ?

In the Columbia River, which has an extensive network of hydroelectric dams, the decline in abundance of adult salmon returning from the ocean since the late 1970s has been ascribed in large measure to the presence of the dams, although the completion of the hydropower system occurred at the same time as large-scale shifts in ocean climate, as measured by climate indices such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. We measured the survival of salmon smolts during their migration to sea using elements of the large-scale acoustic telemetry system, the Pacific Ocean Shelf Tracking (POST) array. Survival measurements using acoustic tags were comparable to those obtained independently using the Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tag system, which is operational at Columbia and Snake River dams. Because the technology underlying the POST array works in both freshwater and the ocean, it is therefore possible to extend the measurement of survival to large rivers lacking dams, such as the Fraser, and to also extend the measurement of survival to the lower Columbia River and estuary, where there are no dams. Of particular note, survival during the downstream migration of at least some endangered Columbia and Snake River Chinook and steelhead stocks appears to be as high or higher than that of the same species migrating out of the Fraser River in Canada, which lacks dams. Equally surprising, smolt survival during migration through the hydrosystem, when scaled by either the time or distance migrated, is higher than in the lower Columbia River and estuary where dams are absent. Our results raise important questions regarding the factors that are preventing the recovery of salmon stocks in the Columbia and the future health of stocks in the Fraser River.},

Methods Ninety-two nonsmoking individuals underwent caffeine phenotyping.
NAT2 genotype was determined by the polymerase chain reaction followed by a
restriction digest (PCR-RFLP).
Results The median ratio for urinary 17 U+17X/137X was 6.7 (range 1.45–18.65).
55% of subjects were slow acetylators. Gender did not affect the metabolic ratio or
NAT2 genotype. Mean 17 U+17X/137X ratio differed between fast (6.75) and
slow (8.69) acetylators (95% CI for the difference, 0.32–3.56).
Conclusions The findings are further evidence that the 17 U+17X/137X urinary
ratio is not a robust measure of CYP1A2 activity. A possible mechanism by which
the ratio might be influenced by NAT2 genotype is suggested.

CYP1A2 is a cytochrome P450 enzyme that is expressed
primarily in the liver and is important in the metabolism
of many drugs as well as procarcinogens such as aromatic
amines. A number of methods for determining CYP1A2
activity in vivo have been developed that rely on the
central role of CYP1A2 in caffeine metabolism (Figure 1).
Wide interindividual variation in CYP1A2 activity has
been reported and this is an important source of variability
in response to drugs metabolized by CYP1A2. Some
evidence has been presented suggesting that a polymor-
phism in CYP1A2 activity may account for a part of the
variability and may be important in determining suscepti-
bility to colorectal cancer [1]. The role of gender in
determining CYP1A2 activity has been unclear because
the effect of the oral contraceptive pill and differences in
smoking rate between men and women have not always
been controlled adequately [2, 3]. Mathematical modelling
has suggested that the 17 U+17X/137X ratio could
theoretically be influenced by urine flow rate or by
polymorphism in acetylation of caffeine metabolites
encoded by the NAT2 locus, although this has not been
examined experimentally [4].
The aim of this study was to determine the effect of
polymorphism at the NAT2 locus and gender on
CYP1A2 activity.},

Based largely on work conducted in industrialized societies, the claim has been made that preferences for low \{WHR\} are culturally invariant. Presumably, the preferences evolved before the advent of agriculture, making foraging populations the best place to test the hypothesis. This was done with the Hadza of Tanzania, who were shown figures of females that varied by weight and waist-to-hip ratio. Low \{WHR\} was not preferred. Hadza men did not consider waist-to-hip ratio when expressing preferences for mates. Instead, they were most interested in the weight of potential partners. Research by others with subjects who practice swidden agriculture also revealed that low \{WHR\} was not preferred. The data from the Hadza coupled with the information derived from this horticultural group bring into question whether preferences for low \{WHR\} are culturally invariant. },

Divergence due to insertions and deletions (indels) along with substitutions was examined separately for different genomic features (coding, noncoding genic, and intergenic sequence). The major part of the genomic divergence could be attributed to indels (5.07{\%}), while the nucleotide divergence was estimated as 1.52{\%}. Thus the total divergence was estimated as 6.58{\%}. When excluding repeats and low-complexity DNA the total divergence decreased to 2.37{\%}. The chromosomal distribution of nucleotide substitutions and indel events was significantly correlated. To further examine the role of indels in primate evolution we focused on coding sequences. Indels were found within the coding sequence of 13{\%} of the genes and approximately half of the indels have not been reported previously. In 5{\%} of the chimpanzee genes, indels or substitutions caused premature stop codons that rendered the affected transcripts nonfunctional. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that indels comprise the majority of the genomic divergence. Furthermore, indels occur frequently in coding sequences. Our results thereby support the hypothesis that indels may have a key role in primate evolution.},

  abstract      = {Recent genomic data have revealed multiple interactions between Neanderthals and modern humans1, but there is currently little genetic evidence regarding Neanderthal behaviour, diet, or disease. Here we describe the shotgun-sequencing of ancient DNA from five specimens of Neanderthal calcified dental plaque (calculus) and the characterization of regional differences in Neanderthal ecology. At Spy cave, Belgium, Neanderthal diet was heavily meat based and included woolly rhinoceros and wild sheep (mouflon), characteristic of a steppe environment. In contrast, no meat was detected in the diet of Neanderthals from El Sidrón cave, Spain, and dietary components of mushrooms, pine nuts, and moss reflected forest gathering2, 3. Differences in diet were also linked to an overall shift in the oral bacterial community (microbiota) and suggested that meat consumption contributed to substantial variation within Neanderthal microbiota. Evidence for self-medication was detected in an El Sidrón Neanderthal with a dental abscess4 and a chronic gastrointestinal pathogen (Enterocytozoon bieneusi). Metagenomic data from this individual also contained a nearly complete genome of the archaeal commensal Methanobrevibacter oralis (10.2× depth of coverage)—the oldest draft microbial genome generated to date, at around 48,000 years old. DNA preserved within dental calculus represents a notable source of information about the behaviour and health of ancient hominin specimens, as well as a unique system that is useful for the study of long-term microbial evolution.},

  abstract      = {An agent-based model (ABM) is used to explore how the ratio of old to young adults (the OY ratio) in a sample of dead individuals is related to aspects of mortality, fertility, and longevity experienced by the living population from which the sample was drawn. The ABM features representations of rules, behaviors, and constraints that affect person- and household-level decisions about marriage, reproduction, and infant mortality in hunterâgatherer systems. The demographic characteristics of the larger model system emerge through human-level interactions playing out in the context of âglobalâ parameters that can be adjusted to produce a range of mortality and fertility conditions. Model data show a relationship between the OY ratios of living populations (the living OY ratio) and assemblages of dead individuals drawn from those populations (the dead OY ratio) that is consistent with that from empirically known ethnographic hunterâgatherer cases. The dead OY ratio is clearly related to the mean ages, mean adult mortality rates, and mean total fertility rates experienced by living populations in the model. Sample size exerts a strong effect on the accuracy with which the calculated dead OY ratio reflects the actual dead OY ratio of the complete assemblage. These results demonstrate that the dead OY ratio is a potentially useful metric for paleodemographic analysis of changes in mortality and mean age, and suggest that, in general, hunterâgatherer populations with higher mortality, higher fertility, and lower mean ages are characterized by lower dead OY ratios.

The outbreak was characterized by a rapid onset and high attack rate, especially among young and middle-aged persons. Young age, number of infected family members, amount of water consumed daily, and gluten intolerance were identified as risk factors for acquiring cryptosporidiosis. Also, chronic intestinal disease and young age were significantly associated with prolonged diarrhea. Identification of Cryptosporidium hominis subtype IbA10G2 in human and environmental samples and consistently low numbers of oocysts in drinking water confirmed insufficient reduction of parasites by the municipal water treatment plant. The current outbreak shows that use of inadequate microbial barriers at water treatment plants can have serious consequences for public health. This risk can be minimized by optimizing control of raw water quality and employing multiple barriers that remove or inactivate all groups of pathogens.},

  abstract      = {The Tyrolean Iceman, a 5,300-year-old glacier mummy recovered at the Tisenjoch (South Tyrol, Italy) together with his clothes and personal equipment, represents a unique opportunity for prehistoric research. The present work examines the Icemanâs tools which are made from chert or are related to chert working - dagger, two arrowheads, endscraper, borer, small flake and antler retoucher - and considers also the arrowhead still embedded in the shoulder of the mummy. The interdisciplinary results achieved by study of the lithic raw material, technology, use-wear analysis, CT analysis and typology all add new information to Ãtziâs individual history and his last days, and allow insights into the way of life of Alpine Copper Age communities. The chert raw material of the small assemblage originates from at least three different areas of provenance in the Southalpine region. One, or possibly two, sources derive from outcrops in the Trentino, specifically the Non Valley. Such variability suggests an extensive provisioning network, not at all limited to the Lessini mountains, which was able to reach the local communities. The Icemanâs toolkit displays typological characteristics of the Northern Italian tradition, but also comprises features typical of the Swiss Horgen culture, which will come as no surprise in the toolkit of a man who lived in a territory where transalpine contacts would have been of great importance. Ãtzi was not a flintknapper, but he was able to resharpen his tools with a medium to good level of skill. Wear traces reveal that he was a right-hander. Most instruments in the toolkit had reached their final stage of usability, displaying extensive usage, mostly from plant working, resharpenings and breaks. Evidently Ãtzi had not had any access to chert for quite some time, which must have been problematic during his last hectic days, preventing him from repairing and integrating his weapons, in particular his arrows. Freshly modified blade tools without any wear suggest planned work which he never carried out, possibly prevented by the events which made him return to the mountains where he was killed by a Southern Alpine archer.},

Data Sources: A MEDLINE search of English-language reports (1966 to 1999) and a manual search of bibliographies of relevant papers. Study Selection: Related experimental, clinical, and basic research studies. Data Extraction: Data in relevant articles were reviewed, and relevant clinical information was extracted. Data Synthesis: The alcohol hangover is characterized by headache, tremulousness, nausea, diarrhea, and fatigue combined with decreased occupational, cognitive, or visualâ€“spatial skill performance. In the United States, related absenteeism and poor job performance cost $148 billion annually (average annual cost per working adult, $2000). Although hangover is associated with alcoholism, most of its cost is incurred by the light-to-moderate drinker. Patients with hangover may pose substantial risk to themselves and others despite having a normal blood alcohol level. Hangover may also be an independent risk factor for cardiac death. Symptoms of hangover seem to be caused by dehydration, hormonal alterations, dysregulated cytokine pathways, and toxic effects of alcohol. Physiologic characteristics include increased cardiac work with normal peripheral resistance, diffuse slowing on electroencephalography, and increased levels of antidiuretic hormone. Effective interventions include rehydration, prostaglandin inhibitors, and vitamin B6. Screening for hangover severity and frequency may help early detection of alcohol dependency and substantially improve quality of life. Recommended interventions include discussion of potential therapies and reminders of the possibility for cognitive and visualâ€“spatial impairment. No evidence suggests that alleviation of hangover symptoms leads to further alcohol consumption, and the discomfort caused by such symptoms may do so. Therefore, treatment seems warranted. Conclusions: Hangover, a common disorder, has substantial morbidity and societal cost. Appropriate management may relieve symptoms in many patients. R-E-M-O-R-S-E! Those dry Martinis did the work for me: Last night at twelve I felt immense, Today I feel like thirty cents. My eyes are blurred, my coppers hot, I'll try to eat, but I cannot. It is no time for mirth and laughter, The cold, gray dawn of the morning after. George Ade, The Sultan of Sulu, 1903 (1) The alcohol hangover has been well-known since at least Biblical times: “Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink” (Isaiah 5:11) (2). Medical investigation, however, has focused on the acute effects of alcohol ingestion. More than 4700 articles have been written about alcohol intoxication since 1965, but only 108 have addressed alcohol hangover (3–5). Recent studies suggest that the alcohol hangover induces cardiovascular and psychomotor morbidity independent of the quantity of alcohol consumed or the frequency of ingestion (6–8).},

  abstract      = {Aflatoxins are well recognized as a cause of liver cancer, but they have additional important toxic effects. In farm and laboratory animals, chronic exposure to aflatoxins compromises immunity and interferes with protein metabolism and multiple micronutrients that are critical to health. These effects have not been widely studied in humans, but the available information indicates that at least some of the effects observed in animals also occur in humans. The prevalence and level of human exposure to aflatoxins on a global scale have been reviewed, and the resulting conclusion was that 4.5 billion persons living in developing countries are chronically exposed to largely uncontrolled amounts of the toxin. A limited amount of information shows that, at least in those locations where it has been studied, the existing aflatoxin exposure results in changes in nutrition and immunity. The aflatoxin exposure and the toxic affects of aflatoxins on immunity and nutrition combine to negatively affect health factors (including HIV infection) that account for >40% of the burden of disease in developing countries where a short lifespan is prevalent. Food systems and economics render developed-country approaches to the management of aflatoxins impractical in developing-country settings, but the strategy of using food additives to protect farm animals from the toxin may also provide effective and economical new approaches to protecting human populations.},

  abstract      = {Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of bullying in primary school children and to examine its association with common symptoms in childhood. Design: Semistructured health interview conducted by school nurses as part of a school medical. Setting: Newham, east London. Subjects: All children in year 4 of school during the academic year 1992-93. Main outcome measures: Reported bullying and common health symptoms. Results: 2962 children (93.1\% of those on the school roll) were interviewed (ages 7.6 to 10.0 years). Information about bullying was not recorded for 114 children. 22.4\% (95\% confidence interval 20.9 to 24.0) of children for whom information was available reported that they had been bullied. There was an association between children reporting being bullied sometimes or more often and reporting not sleeping well (odds ratio 3.6, 2.5 to 5.2), bed wetting (1.7, 1.3 to 2.4), feeling sad (3.6, 1.9 to 6.8), and experiencing more than occasional headaches (2.4, 1.8 to 3.4) and tummy aches (2.4, 1.8 to 3.3). A significant trend for increasing risk of symptoms with increased frequency of bullying was shown for all reported health symptoms (P<0.001). Conclusions: Health professionals seeing primary schoolchildren who present with headaches, tummy ache, feeling sad or very sad, bed wetting, and sleeping difficulties should consider bullying as a possible contributory factor. Key messages Many children report having frequent headaches or tummy aches, that they sleep poorly, wet the bed, or feel sad Children who report these symptoms also report being bullied substantially more often than do their peers Although it is not clear whether the association is causal, health professionals seeing such children should ask about bullying },

METHODS—Performance effects were studied in the same subjects over a period of 28 hours of sleep deprivation and after measured doses of alcohol up to about 0.1% blood alcohol concentration (BAC). There were 39 subjects, 30 employees from the transport industry and nine from the army.
RESULTS—After 17-19 hours without sleep, corresponding to 2230 and 0100, performance on some tests was equivalent or worse than that at a BAC of 0.05%. Response speeds were up to 50% slower for some tests and accuracy measures were significantly poorer than at this level of alcohol. After longer periods without sleep, performance reached levels equivalent to the maximum alcohol dose given to subjects (BAC of 0.1%).
CONCLUSIONS—These findings reinforce the evidence that the fatigue of sleep deprivation is an important factor likely to compromise performance of speed and accuracy of the kind needed for safety on the road and in other industrial settings.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether ketogenic weight reducing diets have adverse effects on cognitive performance. SUBJECTS: 21 overweight women (mean BMI = 41 kg/m2). DESIGN: Randomized double-blinded study. METHOD: Subjects were randomized to ketogenic or nonketogenic liquid formula very low energy diets, that were comparable in energy and in protein content. Subjects remained on the diet for 28 days and were reevaluated periodically with brief measures of cognitive performance assessing attention and mental flexibility. RESULTS: Weight losses were comparable on the two diets (Mean = 8.1 kg). Performance on attention tasks did not differ as a function of the diet. However, performance on the trail making task, a neuropsychological test that requires higher order mental processing and flexibility, was adversely affected by the ketogenic diet. The worsening in performance was observed primarily between baseline and week one of the ketogenic diet. CONCLUSIONS: Further research is needed to confirm this finding and to determine whether ketogenic diets negatively affect other complex mental tasks, such as problem solving.

The finding that the body weight level which animals will defend can be altered by lesions of the lateral and ventromedial hypothalamus has been taken to provide support for this claim. In this paper we describe a simple feedback control model which contains no set point, and yet is able to account in full for these and other data which have been cited in support of the existence of a body weight set point. Since such a model exists it appears to be unnecessary and unparsimonious to introduce the concept of a neural set point to explain the fact that body weight maintains a relatively constant value which is defended against certain types of challenges. Constancy and defense of body weight are at best only prima facie evidence for the existence of a neural set point controlling body weight.},

These surveys indicate that students frequently use flashcards to self-test and that self-testing is primarily used as a way to monitor learning. Whereas previous surveys provide information about whether and why students self-test, they provide minimal information about how and when students choose to self-test. Accordingly, the primary purpose of the current survey was to explore how and when students engage in self-testing. We surveyed 374 undergraduates about the amount of practice and the timing of practice, two factors that strongly affect the efficacy of self-testing. Results indicate that students understand the benefits of practising to higher criterion levels (amount of practice) but do not typically implement or understand the benefits of practising with longer lags (timing of practice). We discuss practical implications for supporting more successful student learning. },

  abstract      = {It has become increasingly clear that low levels of antibiotics present in many environments can select for resistant bacteria, yet the evolutionary pathways for resistance development during exposure to low amounts of antibiotics remain poorly defined. Here we show that Salmonella enterica exposed to sub-MIC levels of streptomycin evolved high-level resistance via novel mechanisms that are different from those observed during lethal selections. During lethal selection only rpsL mutations are found, whereas at sub-MIC selection resistance is generated by several small-effect resistance mutations that combined confer high-level resistance via three different mechanisms: (i) alteration of the ribosomal RNA target (gidB mutations), (ii) reduction in aminoglycoside uptake (cyoB, nuoG, and trkH mutations), and (iii) induction of the aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme AadA (znuA mutations). These results demonstrate how the strength of the selective pressure influences evolutionary trajectories and that even weak selective pressures can cause evolution of high-level resistance.},

Differences between conditions were detected with the general linear method (factorial model). Barefoot running is characterized by a significantly larger external loading rate than the shod condition. The flatter foot placement at touchdown is prepared in free flight, implying an actively induced adaptation strategy. In the barefoot condition, plantar pressure measurements reveal a flatter foot placement to correlate with lower peak heel pressures. Therefore, it is assumed that runners adopt this different touchdown geometry in barefoot running in an attempt to limit the local pressure underneath the heel. A significantly higher leg stiffness during the stance phase was found for the barefoot condition. The sagittal kinematic adaptations between conditions were found in the same way for all subjects and at the three running velocities. However, large individual variations were observed between the runners for the rearfoot kinematics.},

While males are more promiscuous and display higher prenatal testosterone exposure than females overall, our analyses also suggest that the within-sex variation of these variables is best described by two underlying mixture models, suggesting the presence of two phenotypes with a monogamous/promiscuous ratio that slightly favours monogamy in females and promiscuity in males.

Evidence suggests that the YDB cosmic impact triggered an âimpact winterâ and the subsequent Younger Dryas (YD) climate episode, biomass burning, late Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions, and human cultural shifts and population declines. The cosmic impact deposited anomalously high concentrations of platinum over much of the Northern Hemisphere, as recorded at 26 YDB sites at the YD onset, including the Greenland Ice Sheet Project 2 ice core, in which platinum deposition spans â¼21 y (â¼12,836â12,815 cal BP). The YD onset also exhibits increased dust concentrations, synchronous with the onset of a remarkably high peak in ammonium, a biomass-burning aerosol. In four ice-core sequences from Greenland, Antarctica, and Russia, similar anomalous peaks in other combustion aerosols occur, including nitrate, oxalate, acetate, and formate, reflecting one of the largest biomass-burning episodes in more than 120,000 y. In support of widespread wildfires, the perturbations in CO2 records from Taylor Glacier, Antarctica, suggest that biomass burning at the YD onset may have consumed â¼10 million km2, or â¼9\% of Earthâs terrestrial biomass. The ice record is consistent with YDB impact theory that extensive impact-related biomass burning triggered the abrupt onset of an impact winter, which led, through climatic feedbacks, to the anomalous YD climate episode. },

Furthermore, all common variants together captured 60% of heritability. The 697 variants clustered in 423 loci were enriched for
genes, pathways and tissue types known to be involved in growth and together implicated genes and pathways not highlighted in
earlier efforts, such as signaling by fibroblast growth factors, WNT/b-catenin and chondroitin sulfate–related genes. We identified
several genes and pathways not previously connected with human skeletal growth, including mTOR, osteoglycin and binding

Dams built by beaver (Castor canadensis) dramatically alter riparian landscapes throughout much of North America. In the central Adirondacks, New York, USA, ecosystem engineering by beaver leads to the formation of extensive wetland habitat capable of supporting herbaceous plant species not found elsewhere in the riparian zone. We show that by increasing habitat heterogeneity, beaver increase the number of species of herbaceous plants in the riparian zone by over 33{\%} at a scale that encompasses both beaver-modified patches and patches with no history of beaver occupation. We suggest that ecosystem engineers will increase species richness at the landscape scale whenever there are species present in a landscape that are restricted to engineered habitats during at least some stages of their life cycle.},

Over the past decade, a role for lactate in fueling the energetic requirements of neurons has emerged. Furthermore, a neuroprotective effect of lactate during hypoglycemia or cerebral ischemia has been reported. The majority of the current evidence concerning lactate metabolism at the cellular level is based on in vitro data; only a few recent in vivo results have demonstrated that the brain preferentially utilizes lactate over glucose. Using voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) imaging, beta-probe measurements of radiotracer kinetics, and brain activation by sensory stimulation in the anesthetized rat, we investigated several aspects of cerebral lactate metabolism. The present study is the first in vivo demonstration of the maintenance of neuronal activity in the presence of lactate as the primary energy source. The loss of the voltage-sensitive dye signal found during severe insulin-induced hypoglycemia is completely prevented by lactate infusion. Thus, lactate has a direct neuroprotective effect. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the brain readily oxidizes lactate in an activity-dependent manner. The washout of 1-[11C]l-lactate, reflecting cerebral lactate oxidation, was observed to increase during brain activation from 0.077 {\textpm} 0.009 to 0.105 {\textpm} 0.007 min-1. Finally, our data confirm that the brain prefers lactate over glucose as an energy substrate when both substrates are available. Using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) to measure the local cerebral metabolic rate of glucose, we demonstrated a lactate concentration-dependent reduction of cerebral glucose utilization during experimentally increased plasma lactate levels.},

One of the most challenging questions regarding aquatic search and rescue or recovery operations is the physiological status of the victims. A Probability of Survival Decision Aid (PSDA) was developed to predict survival time for hypothermia and dehydration during prolonged exposure in marine environments for a wide range of environmental conditions. PSDA calculates the survival time of a victim in the water or floating in an emergency craft as a function of environmental conditions, clothing and human anthropometric parameters. PSDA consists of a human thermoregulatory model and a Graphic User Interface, which manages inputs, run the model and display outputs. PSDA was validated using historical survival data and reports of accidental water immersions. For eight immersion victims of known height and weight, the victims’ predicted survival time was either in close agreement or greater than the observed survival time. Additional physiological data from case histories and/or controlled studies are needed to validate the PSDA and to expand its application to other hazardous situations. PSDA is intended to assist the search and rescue personnel in operation optimal planning.

Highlights

► Prediction of victims’ physiological status is essential to search and rescue operation planning. ► Probability of Survival Decision Aid (PSDA) is a user-friendly support tool. ► PSDA predicts survival time for hypothermia and dehydration in marine environments. ► PSDA was validated using historical survival data and reports of accidental water immersions.

Yang et al. investigated the precise role of sleep in changing mouse brain structures (see the Perspective by Euston and Steenland). When mice learned motor tasks, small protuberances{\textemdash}or {\textquotedblleft}spines{\textquotedblright}{\textemdash}formed on some of the dendritic branches of specific brain neurons. These spines represent the physical correlate of a memory. But the neurons grew and retained these spines better when the mice slept after learning the task. Neurons that fired during learning fired again during subsequent slow-wave sleep, allowing the mice to conserve the newly formed spines{\textemdash}and memories.Science, this issue p. 1173; see also p. 1087How sleep helps learning and memory remains unknown. We report in mouse motor cortex that sleep after motor learning promotes the formation of postsynaptic dendritic spines on a subset of branches of individual layer V pyramidal neurons. New spines are formed on different sets of dendritic branches in response to different learning tasks and are protected from being eliminated when multiple tasks are learned. Neurons activated during learning of a motor task are reactivated during subsequent non{\textendash}rapid eye movement sleep, and disrupting this neuronal reactivation prevents branch-specific spine formation. These findings indicate that sleep has a key role in promoting learning-dependent synapse formation and maintenance on selected dendritic branches, which contribute to memory storage.},

Here, we present a new concept to turn the harmful visceral fat into a beneficial energy consumption depot, which is beneficial for improvement of metabolic dysfunctions in obese mice. We show that low temperatureâdependent browning of visceral fat caused decreased adipose weight, total body weight, and body mass index, despite increased food intake. In high-fat dietâfed mice, low temperature exposure improved browning of visceral fat, global metabolism via nonshivering thermogenesis, insulin sensitivity, and hepatic steatosis. Genome-wide expression profiling showed upregulation of WAT browningârelated genes including Cidea and Dio2. Conversely, Prdm16 was unchanged in healthy mice or was downregulated in obese mice. Surgical removal of visceral fat and genetic knockdown of UCP1 in epididymal fat largely ablated low temperatureâincreased global thermogenesis and resulted in the death of most mice. Thus, browning of visceral fat may be a compensatory heating mechanism that could provide a novel therapeutic strategy for treating visceral fatâassociated obesity and diabetes.},

  abstract      = {The increased recognition that the worldwide increase in incidence of obesity is due to a positive energy balance has lead to a focus on lifestyle choices that may contribute to excess energy intake, including the widespread belief that alcohol intake is a significant risk factor for development of obesity. This brief review examines this issue by contrasting short-term laboratory-based studies of the effects of alcohol on appetite and energy balance and longer-term epidemiological data exploring the relationship between alcohol intake and body weight. Current research clearly shows that energy consumed as alcohol is additive to that from other dietary sources, leading to short-term passive over-consumption of energy when alcohol is consumed. Indeed, alcohol consumed before or with meals tends to increase food intake, probably through enhancing the short-term rewarding effects of food. However, while these data might suggest that alcohol is a risk factor for obesity, epidemiological data suggests that moderate alcohol intake may protect against obesity, particularly in women. In contrast, higher intakes of alcohol in the absence of alcohol dependence may increase the risk of obesity, as may binge-drinking, however these effects may be secondary to personality and habitual beverage preferences. },

  abstract      = {How did humans sleep before the modern era? Because the tools to measure sleep under natural conditions were developed long after the invention of the electric devices suspected of delaying and reducing sleep, we investigated sleep in three preindustrial societies [1–3]. We find that all three show similar sleep organization, suggesting that they express core human sleep patterns, most likely characteristic of pre-modern era Homo sapiens. Sleep periods, the times from onset to offset, averaged 6.9–8.5 hr, with sleep durations of 5.7–7.1 hr, amounts near the low end of those industrial societies [4–7]. There was a difference of nearly 1 hr between summer and winter sleep. Daily variation in sleep duration was strongly linked to time of onset, rather than offset. None of these groups began sleep near sunset, onset occurring, on average, 3.3 hr after sunset. Awakening was usually before sunrise. The sleep period consistently occurred during the nighttime period of falling environmental temperature, was not interrupted by extended periods of waking, and terminated, with vasoconstriction, near the nadir of daily ambient temperature. The daily cycle of temperature change, largely eliminated from modern sleep environments, may be a potent natural regulator of sleep. Light exposure was maximal in the morning and greatly decreased at noon, indicating that all three groups seek shade at midday and that light activation of the suprachiasmatic nucleus is maximal in the morning. Napping occurred on <7% of days in winter and <22% of days in summer. Mimicking aspects of the natural environment might be effective in treating certain modern sleep disorders.},

Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is used extensively worldwide in plastic products, and its accumulation in the environment has become a global concern. Because the ability to enzymatically degrade PET has been thought to be limited to a few fungal species, biodegradation is not yet a viable remediation or recycling strategy. By screening natural microbial communities exposed to PET in the environment, we isolated a novel bacterium, Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6, that is able to use PET as its major energy and carbon source. When grown on PET, this strain produces two enzymes capable of hydrolyzing PET and the reaction intermediate, mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid. Both enzymes are required to enzymatically convert PET efficiently into its two environmentally benign monomers, terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol.},
  comment       = {Some bacteria think plastic is fantastic
Bacteria isolated from outside a bottle-recycling facility can break down and metabolize plastic. The proliferation of plastics in consumer products, from bottles to clothing, has resulted in the release of countless tons of plastics into the environment. Yoshida et al. show how the biodegradation of plastics by specialized bacteria could be a viable bioremediation strategy (see the Perspective by Bornscheuer). The new species, Ideonella sakaiensis, breaks down the plastic by using two enzymes to hydrolyze PET and a primary reaction intermediate, eventually yielding basic building blocks for growth.

  abstract      = {Sleep deprivation is now recognized as an increasingly common condition inherent to modern society, and one that in many ways, is detrimental to certain physiological systems, namely, immune function. Although sleep is now viewed by a significant body of researchers as being essential for the proper working of a host of defense systems, the consequences of a lack of sleep on immune function remains to be fully comprehended. The aim of the current study was to investigate how paradoxical sleep deprivation (PSD) for 24 and 96 h and sleep restriction (SR) for 21 days by the modified multiple-platform method, and their respective 24-h recovery periods, affect immune activation in rats. To this end, we assessed circulating white blood cell counts, lymphocyte count within immune organs, as well as Ig and complement production. The data revealed that PSD for 96 h increased complement C3 and corticosterone concentration in relation to the control group. In contrast, the spleen weight, total leukocytes, and lymphocytes decreased during SR for 21 days when compared with the control group, although production of a certain class of immunoglobulin, the IgM, did increase. After recovery sleep, lymphocyte count in axillary lymph nodes grew when rats had rebound sleep after PSD for 24 h, neutrophils increased after PSD 96 h and lymphocytes numbers were higher after SR 21 days. Such alterations during sleep deprivation suggest only minor alterations of nonspecific immune parameters during acute PSD, and a significant impairment in cellular response during chronic SR.},

  abstract      = {Earth is the one known example of an inhabited planet and to current knowledge the likeliest site of the one known origin of life. Here we discuss the origin of Earth’s atmosphere and ocean and some of the environmental conditions of the early Earth as they may relate to the origin of life. A key punctuating event in the narrative is the Moon-forming impact, partly because it made Earth for a short time absolutely uninhabitable, and partly because it sets the boundary conditions for Earth’s subsequent evolution. If life began on Earth, as opposed to having migrated here, it would have done so after the Moon-forming impact. What took place before the Moon formed determined the bulk properties of the Earth and probably determined the overall compositions and sizes of its atmospheres and oceans. What took place afterward animated these materials. One interesting consequence of the Moon-forming impact is that the mantle is devolatized, so that the volatiles subsequently fell out in a kind of condensation sequence. This ensures that the volatiles were concentrated toward the surface so that, for example, the oceans were likely salty from the start. We also point out that an atmosphere generated by impact degassing would tend to have a composition reflective of the impacting bodies (rather than the mantle), and these are almost without exception strongly reducing and volatile-rich. A consequence is that, although CO- or methane-rich atmospheres are not necessarily stable as steady states, they are quite likely to have existed as long-lived transients, many times. With CO comes abundant chemical energy in a metastable package, and with methane comes hydrogen cyanide and ammonia as important albeit less abundant gases.},

Conditions when both men and women experience extremely high levels of mortality risk are unexplored sources of information. We investigate the survival of both sexes in seven populations under extreme conditions from famines, epidemics, and slavery. Women survived better than men: In all populations, they had lower mortality across almost all ages, and, with the exception of one slave population, they lived longer on average than men. Gender differences in infant mortality contributed the most to the gender gap in life expectancy, indicating that newborn girls were able to survive extreme mortality hazards better than newborn boys. Our results confirm the ubiquity of a female survival advantage even when mortality is extraordinarily high. The hypothesis that the survival advantage of women has fundamental biological underpinnings is supported by the fact that under very harsh conditions females survive better than males even at infant ages when behavioral and social differences may be minimal or favor males. Our findings also indicate that the female advantage differs across environments and is modulated by social factors.},

  abstract      = {Explaining the ~5-million-year delay in marine biotic recovery following the latest Permian mass extinction, the largest biotic crisis of the Phanerozoic, is a fundamental challenge for both geological and biological sciences. Ocean redox perturbations may have played a critical role in this delayed recovery. However, the lack of quantitative constraints on the details of Early Triassic oceanic anoxia (for example, time, duration, and extent) leaves the links between oceanic conditions and the delayed biotic recovery ambiguous. We report high-resolution U-isotope (Î´238U) data from carbonates of the uppermost Permian to lowermost Middle Triassic Zal section (Iran) to characterize the timing and global extent of ocean redox variation during the Early Triassic. Our Î´238U record reveals multiple negative shifts during the Early Triassic. Isotope mass-balance modeling suggests that the global area of anoxic seafloor expanded substantially in the Early Triassic, peaking during the latest Permian to mid-Griesbachian, the late Griesbachian to mid-Dienerian, the Smithian-Spathian transition, and the Early/Middle Triassic transition. Comparisons of the U-, C-, and Sr-isotope records with a modeled seawater PO43- concentration curve for the Early Triassic suggest that elevated marine productivity and enhanced oceanic stratification were likely the immediate causes of expanded oceanic anoxia. The patterns of redox variation documented by the U-isotope record show a good first-order correspondence to peaks in ammonoid extinctions during the Early Triassic. Our results indicate that multiple oscillations in oceanic anoxia modulated the recovery of marine ecosystems following the latest Permian mass extinction.},

Joohee Han, 25, disappeared last Friday while climbing Mount Tyson in Tully, south of Cairns. She lost her footing near the Scout Rock lookout and fell into dense bushland, knocking herself unconscious for over five hours.

Paramedic Hannah Gaulke told AAP Han survived by “crawling and scraping” her way through tough terrain until she found a “slippery, rocky waterfall” with running water.

Han stayed there for days until emergency crews rescued her on Thursday afternoon, using a helicopter and 60-foot (18m) winch to pull her from the ravine.

“In the entire time she was missing she’d had no food with her at all,” Gaulke said. 

A Scottish tourist who was staying at the same hostel as Han described it as a “miracle”.

“I’ve climbed that thing three times, two in a group and one myself, and after I did it myself I said I would never be going up again,” Craig Strathie told the ABC. “Heck, I’m Scottish — we’ve got mountains all the time, but that thing can be pretty dangerous.”

The area’s Special Emergency Services coordinator, Eleanor Rosam, said it was “a very difficult” track that was not used frequently.

A sign near the track warns visitors that the climb takes about three hours, can be dangerous in wet weather and “any person undertaking it [does] so at their own risk”.

On Friday Han was recuperating in Tully hospital, where she was treated for dehydration and minor scratches. Gaulke said she had “no significant injuries” and was in good spirits.

Insp Steve Kersley from Queensland police said Han had “done well to survive” the ordeal. “Six days is a long time to be lost in the bush,” he said},

For the current century, estimates of the potential human health impact of these declines range from 138 million to 1.4 billion, depending on the nutrient. However, changes in plant-based vitamin content in response to [CO2] have not been elucidated. Inclusion of vitamin information would substantially improve estimates of health risks. Among crop species, rice is the primary food source for more than 2 billion people. We used multiyear, multilocation in situ FACE (free-air CO2 enrichment) experiments for 18 genetically diverse rice lines, including Japonica, Indica, and hybrids currently grown throughout Asia. We report for the first time the integrated nutritional impact of those changes (protein, micronutrients, and vitamins) for the 10 countries that consume the most rice as part of their daily caloric supply. Whereas our results confirm the declines in protein, iron, and zinc, we also find consistent declines in vitamins B1, B2, B5, and B9 and, conversely, an increase in vitamin E. A strong correlation between the impacts of elevated [CO2] on vitamin content based on the molecular fraction of nitrogen within the vitamin was observed. Finally, potential health risks associated with anticipated CO2-induced deficits of protein, minerals, and vitamins in rice were correlated to the lowest overall gross domestic product per capita for the highest rice-consuming countries, suggesting potential consequences for a global population of approximately 600 million.},

Plantago major L. (greater plantain, common plantain) has been used as a wound healing remedy in different parts of the world for centuries. Different bioactive compounds have been proposed to contribute to the wound healing properties of this plant. The present study was undertaken to investigate the impact of some genetic and environmental factors on the wound healing activity of common plantain. 
Seeds of P. major were collected from five populations in different parts of Sweden, and were germinated and grown in a greenhouse. As expected for an inbreeding species, RAPD analyses demonstrated considerable between-population variation but very sparse within-population and within-subpopulation variation. Six major phenolic compounds were encountered in samples of P. major, four of which were identified for the first time in this thesis; PLMA 1–PLMA 4. Between-population and sub-population differences in the contents of these chemical compounds showed no correlation with RAPD-based estimates of genetic relatedness. The contents of these compounds differed greatly between different plant organs of P. major. The highest concentration of plantamajoside and PLMA 2 was found in leaves whereas the highest concentration of verbascoside was found in flower stalks and seeds. Contents were significantly higher in freeze-dried leaf samples compared to samples dried at higher temperatures. Both water and ethanol-based extracts of P. major leaves stimulated the cell proliferation and migration in an in vitro scratch assay, and also showed anti-inflammatory activity in an in vitro NF-kB assay with oral epithelial cell cultures. Similarly, these extracts stimulated wound healing activities in ex vivo tests using detached pig ears. Further breeding efforts aimed at developing P. major as a crop plant, and medicinal research aimed at elucidating and optimizing extracts with wound healing properties, are thus warranted.},

Kloka gummor hade rätt – groblad kan läka sår
PUBLICERAD: 18 APRIL 2012
Groblad har använts som medicinalväxt i många århundraden, och forna tiders kloka gummor brukade bandagera sår med bladen. Nu bekräftar en avhandling av Muhammad Zubair från SLU att de gjorde alldeles rätt; positiva effekter av groblad har påvisats både med odlade celler av människa och med sår på grisöron. Nya sårläkningsprodukter är målet inom forskningsprojektet.

Hänvisningar till grobladets sårläkande egenskaper finns i antika grekiska skrifter, och även hos Shakespeare (Romeo och Julia). Växten har haft en viktig plats även i nordisk folkmedicin, och namnet groblad användes redan i de medeltida läkeböckerna. Även senare tiders distriktssjuksköterskor har använt denna metod. Trots detta har det bara gjorts ett fåtal vetenskapliga studier av bakgrunden till växtens sårläkande egenskaper.

Muhammad Zubair har genomfört sitt doktorsarbete inom ett samarbete mellan SLU i Balsgård och Högskolan i Kristianstad. Målsättningen är att framställa ett ekologiskt odlat växtmaterial med hög halt av bioaktiva substanser och en väl dokumenterad förmåga att läka sår. Detta växtmaterial ska sedan kunna användas för att framställa sårläkningsprodukter.

Växtmaterialet
En viktig fråga innan förädling av kommersiella sorter kan komma igång är hur olika egenskaper varierar bland vilda, svenska grobladspopulationer. I försöken jämfördes därför växthusodlade fröplantor med ursprung i flera delar av landet. Precis som väntat för en självbefruktande art, visade DNA-markörer att plantor som kommer från samma växtlokal har näst intill identiska DNA-profiler, medan plantor från olika lokaler skiljer sig tydligt åt. Detta innebär att det kommer att bli lätt att odla fram ett enhetligt, sortäkta material av groblad.

Kemiskt innehåll
Groblad innehåller många kemiska substanser som kan ha betydelse för sårläkning. Muhammad Zubair och hans kollegor har inriktat sig på växtens fenolämnen, och utöver två redan kända ämnen (plantamajosid och verbascosid) kunde de identifiera fyra tidigare okända polyfenoler. Halterna i olika växtdelar (blad, blomställningar och frön) varierade betydligt, vilket är viktigt att känna till i det fortsatta arbetet.

Hantering efter skörd
En jämförelse av olika sätt att torka växtens blad visade att grobladets fenoler är värmekänsliga. Bäst utbyte gav frystorkning, vilket dock är en dyr metod. Torkning i vanlig varmluftsugn gav också ett bra resultat, med bibehållet innehåll av olika fenoler, men temperaturen får då inte överstiga 30 °C.

Inför de fortsatta försöken gjordes extrakt med vatten respektive etanol av både färska och torkade blad. 

Sårläkningsförsök med odlade celler
I två studier som sedan gjordes på tunna skikt av odlade humana munepitelceller visade sig grobladsextrakt ha tydliga, positiva effekter. I den första studien gjordes en tunn skåra i cellskiktet, och en behandling med grobladsextrakt gjorde här att skåran drog ihop sig snabbare. I den andra studien påvisades en antiinflammatorisk effekt av grobladsextrakt, då samma munepitelceller hade utsatts för en dos av ett bakterietoxin som kan framkalla inflammation.

Sårläkningsförsök med grisöron
För att undersöka sårläkning behöver man även tillgång till mera komplext uppbyggd vävnad. Muhammad Zubair och hans kollegor använde ett test där man använder öron från nyslaktade grisar – ett test som nyligen patenterats av en forskargrupp i Hamburg. Potentiella sårläkningsextrakt testas på små utstansade vävnadsbiopsier där det gjorts ett sår i mitten. Även i dessa studier visade sig grobladsextrakt ha positiva effekter på sårläkning.

– Resultaten är mycket lovande, säger forskarna på Balsgård. Det återstår dock en hel del forsknings- och utvecklingsarbete. Vi måste ta reda på mer om exakt vilka substanser som är verksamma vid sårläkning, och därefter kan vi gå vidare med att optimera både växtmaterialet och odlingsmetoderna.

The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effects from different leaf extracts of the traditional medicinal herb Plantago major L. (plantain) on cell proliferation and migration in vitro, as a test for potential wound healing properties.
Materials and methods
Water and ethanol-based extracts were prepared from Plantago major fresh and dried leaves, and tested in vitro in a scratch assay with oral epithelial cells.
Results
The scratch assay produced reliable results after 18h. Most of the tested extracts increased the proliferation/migration of the oral epithelial cells compared to the negative control. A concentration of 1.0mg/mL (on dry weight basis) appears to be optimal regardless of type of extract, and among the alternatives, 0.1mg/mL was always better than 10mg/mL. Ethanol-based extracts with a concentration of 10mg/mL had very detrimental effects on cell proliferation/migration. At the other two concentrations, ethanol-based extracts had the most beneficial effect, followed by water extracts of fresh leaves, ethanol plus water extracts of dried leaves and, finally, water extracts of dried leaves.
Conclusions
This study suggests that both the water extracts and the more polyphenol-rich ethanol-based extracts of Plantago major leaves have medicinal properties. Further research is, however, needed to determine what compounds are responsible for the wound healing effects.},

This species already has a high market demand in Asia, and attempts to domesticate P. major as a medicinal crop in horticulture are emerging also in Europe. Both polysaccharides and polyphenols have been proposed to have bioactive effects. In this study, major phenols were analysed in leaves, flower stalks and seeds of P. major plants from five homogenous offspring families, as verified by DNA-marker analysis. Furthermore, leaves were harvested and dried at different temperatures. The contents of plantamajoside, verbascoside and a hitherto unidentified compound, P1, differed greatly between plant organs. Degradation of leaf polyphenols increased with an increase in drying temperature, and consequently, freeze-drying resulted in the highest content of phenols. Thus it is important to select plant material of a suitable organ or combination of organs, and to use the lowest possible drying temperature to obtain a high content of a specific phenolic compound in P. major.},

  abstract      = {Germany is having trouble deciding whether plants that are gene-edited should be regulated as if they were genetically modified (GM). Confused? You’re not alone: the issue has split the German government and has left scientists across Europe in limbo.

Europe’s genetically edited plants stuck in legal limbo
Crop conundrum
Plant scientists say that new editing tools, including CRISPR–Cas9, involve no more than making tiny, precisely targeted changes to a gene that are indistinguishable from natural mutations. But opponents say that any form of meddling with genes is potentially perilous.

Germans attach great value to public dialogue. So on 14 February, the Leopoldina, Germany’s national science academy, hosted a debate on the issue. Officials from the federal environment ministry and its office for nature protection spoke passionately in favour of ever-greater regulation, whereas the agriculture ministry and the office for consumer protection and food safety disagreed.

The debate might never have taken place if the European Union itself had been able to decide on the issue. But it is habitually paralysed whenever genetic modification is discussed. Two years ago the European Commission requested all member states to hold back on giving the all-clear on gene editing while it considered its options. Now its hand is being forced, ever so slowly, by the referral of the issue by France to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) last October. French non-governmental organizations and trade unions had called on the French state to regulate organisms created through all methods of mutagenesis, including classical methods. They argued that easy-to-use, modern gene-editing tools will encourage large numbers of new plants to be created whose environmental impacts are uncertain. At the Leopoldina meeting, the German office for nature protection aligned itself with this argument.

The ECJ told Nature that a decision is not expected before 2018 because the case is so politically sensitive. That’s a long time to wait, given that so much is at stake. GM-style regulation is complex and exorbitantly costly. CRISPR technology, although very new, has already led to many gene-edited plants that are ready for outdoor field trials. Such studies should not be held up. Some are intended to shed light on basic plant biology, such as how plants adapt themselves so readily to their environments. Others will determine whether the gene-edited plants have new traits that make them better crops. European scientists are competing with countries such as the United States, where gene-edited products are not considered equivalent to GM products, at least for now. And earlier this month the European Ombudsman stated that the legal limbo does not mean that gene editing should be put on freeze.

“CRISPR technology has already led to many gene-edited plants that are ready for outdoor field trials.”
Some EU member states are forging their own way through the muddle. In 2015, Sweden decided that the technical and legal issues in favour of non-regulation were crystal clear and told its plant scientists that they could go ahead. It has promised to reverse its position should the EU decide on regulation. Stefan Jansson at Ume{\r{a}} University made such swift progress that he hosted a press lunch last summer where he served up ‘tagliatelle with CRISPRy fried vegetables’ using ingredients from his garden, including a gene-edited cabbage. According to those present, it was delicious. Last year, Finland chose a similar path, although no field trials have begun.

Sabres are rattling in the Netherlands, where the parliament’s lower house called on the government last week to consider the exclusion of most forms of gene editing from GM regulation. The United Kingdom has maintained silence, and will in any case be under no obligation to follow EU rules once Brexit is complete.

Germany, meanwhile, is being forced to wait for the ECJ decision. In 2015, the consumer protection office told the San Diego-based biotechnology company Cibus that its herbicide-resistant oilseed rape, created using one of the earlier gene-editing technologies, would not need to be regulated in the country. Opponents immediately brought a court case — but that local court is now awaiting ECJ guidance. And during this election year, the German government is highly unlikely to risk making sensitive decisions.

The ECJ has an unfortunate history of delivering highly conservative or scientifically confused verdicts on complex biological issues. In 2011, it outlawed patents that depended even indirectly on human embryonic stem-cell lines, adding that similar basic research was immoral. And in the same year it nearly upended the European honey market with a muddled decision about alleged traces of pollen from GM maize.

Plant scientists should spend the waiting time engaging in public dialogue like the one Germany is leading about the safety and value of gene editing. Reason and science need to prevail this time.

The content of total phenols, total flavonoids and total non-flavonoids in green teas was determined spectrophotometrically, while 7 flavan-3-ols, 6 phenolic acids and 3 methylxanthines were identified and quantified by using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC–PDA). Among the tested green teas bagged green tea Twinings of London was recognized as the richest source of phenolic compounds (3585 mg/L \{GAE\} of total phenols). The most abundant phenolic constituents of green tea were flavan-3-ols, of which \{EGCG\} was prevailing in all teas (94.54–357.07 mg/L). The highest content of caffeine, as the most abundant methylxanthine, was determined in powdered green tea. The findings of this investigation suggest that extraction efficiency of studied bioactive compounds from green tea depends on the extraction conditions and that maximum extraction efficiency is achieved during aqueous extraction at 80 °C, for 5′ (powder), 15′ (bagged) and 30′ (loose leaf). In order to determine the antioxidant capacity of teas the DPPH, \{ABTS\} and \{FRAP\} assays were applied. Regardless of the extraction conditions all green teas exhibited significant antioxidant capacity in vitro, which was in correlation with their phenolic content, confirming that green tea is one of the best dietary sources of antioxidants. },

We described the association between scrotal temperature and daily activities in 101 males using a non-invasive method for measuring scrotal temperature. A thermistor was attached to the underwear and the temperature of the scrotal skin was logged by a portable device every 5min for 24h. Participants reported sedentary position and activities at work and during spare time in a questionnaire. Scrotal temperature was strongly corelated with sedentary work position with a dose–effect association (<1h sedentary: 33.1°C, >6h sedentary: 34.7°C, median values). The variation in sedentary work accounted for 31.5% of the variation in median temperature during the entire 24h. Sedentary position during spare time did not correlate with scrotal temperature. Median temperature at night was 1.2°C higher than during the daytime. No effect was found for size or reported tightness of the underwear. In a model experiment, the deviance between testicular and scrotal temperature was estimated as maximally 0.1–0.6°C, depending on the type of activity. Measuring scrotal temperature provides a valid estimate of testicular temperature and is feasible in large cohorts. We conclude that work position is an important determinant of testicular temperature.},

Although psychological traits are known to impact sexual attitudes and behavior, sexuality- and personality-related traits have not been jointly investigated to assess their relevance for sexual functioning in couples. The aim of this study was to investigate how psychological traits of two partners influence women’s and men’s sexual function. Data from 964 couples, representative of the adult population in Germany, were analyzed. Sexual function was assessed with the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). Sexuality-related traits were measured with the Sexual Excitation/Sexual Inhibition Inventory for Women and Men (SESII-W/M). Personality was measured with self-report and partner-rating versions of the Big Five Inventory (BFI). Sexual excitation was a positive and sexual inhibition was a negative predictor of sexual function in both genders. Women whose partners were sexually inhibited reported lower sexual function. Conscientious individuals reported better sexual function. Women whose partners were more conscientious also had better sexual function. Assessing partner-related factors may be helpful to identify predisposing and maintaining factors of sexual dysfunctions, especially in women. },

We conducted a multiproxy study of ancient diet in the 12th–13th century AD cemetery at Kukruse, NE-Estonia, in order to address the question of socially constrained food in the past. Two different food related archaeological sources – ceramic vessels and human bones – were investigated by applying organic residue (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), bulk isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS), gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-C-IRMS)), and plant microfossil analysis for the first, and human bone stable isotope (IRMS) analysis for the latter. Results show that there was a gender and to some extent also age-specific food consumption by different community members at Kukruse: male (and some older female) diet was based on more aquatic and higher trophic level organisms, whilst younger females tend to feed on lower trophic level and potentially more herbivorous animals and their products. The paper emphasises the concept of past diet as a social phenomenon, the aspects of which can be best revealed with the help of multiproxy bioarchaeological analysis.},

TW never exceeds 31 {\textdegree}C. Any exceedence of 35 {\textdegree}C for extended periods should induce hyperthermia in humans and other mammals, as dissipation of metabolic heat becomes impossible. While this never happens now, it would begin to occur with global-mean warming of about 7 {\textdegree}C, calling the habitability of some regions into question. With 11{\textendash}12 {\textdegree}C warming, such regions would spread to encompass the majority of the human population as currently distributed. Eventual warmings of 12 {\textdegree}C are possible from fossil fuel burning. One implication is that recent estimates of the costs of unmitigated climate change are too low unless the range of possible warming can somehow be narrowed. Heat stress also may help explain trends in the mammalian fossil record.},

However, whether CH4 uptake by forest soils is affected by global environmental change is unknown. We measured soil to atmosphere net CH4 fluxes in temperate forests at two long-term ecological research sites in the northeastern United States from the late 1990s to the mid-2010s. We found that annual soil CH4 uptake decreased by 62\% and 53\% in urban and rural forests in Baltimore, Maryland and by 74\% and 89\% in calcium-fertilized and reference forests at Hubbard Brook, New Hampshire over this period. This decrease occurred despite marked declines in nitrogen deposition and increases in atmospheric CH4 concentration and temperature, which should lead to increases in CH4 uptake. This decrease in soil CH4 uptake appears to be driven by increases in precipitation and soil hydrological flux. Furthermore, an analysis of CH4 uptake around the globe showed that CH4 uptake in forest soils has decreased by an average of 77\% from 1988 to 2015, particularly in forests located from 0 to 60 {\textdegree}N latitude where precipitation has been increasing.

  abstract      = {STUDY QUESTION: Is self-reported type of underwear worn associated with markers of testicular function among men at a fertility
center?
SUMMARY ANSWER: Men who reported most frequently wearing boxers had higher sperm concentration and total count, and lower
FSH levels, compared to men who did not.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Elevated scrotal temperatures are known to adversely affect testicular function. However, the epidemiologic
literature on type of underwear, as a proxy of scrotal temperature, and male testicular function is inconsistent.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This is a cross-sectional study including 656 male partners of couples seeking infertility treatment
at a fertility center (2000–2017).
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Self-reported information on type of underwear worn was collected from a
take-home questionnaire. Semen samples were analyzed following World Health Organization guidelines. Enzyme immunoassays were used
to assess reproductive hormone levels and neutral comet assays for sperm DNA damage. We fit linear regression models to evaluate the
association between underwear type and testicular function, adjusting for covariates and accounting for multiple semen samples.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Men had a median (interquartile range) age of 35.5 (32.0, 39.3) years and BMI of 26.3
(24.4, 29.9) kg/m2
. About half of the men (53%; n = 345) reported usually wearing boxers. Men who reported primarily wearing boxers had
a 25% higher sperm concentration (95% CI = 7, 31%), 17% higher total count (95% CI = 0, 28%) and 14% lower serum FSH levels (95% CI =
−27, −1%) than men who reported not primarily wearing boxers. Sperm concentration and total count were inversely related to serum FSH.
Furthermore, the differences in sperm concentration and total count according to type of underwear were attenuated after adjustment for
serum FSH. No associations with other measured reproductive outcomes were observed.
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Our results may not be generalizable to men from the general population. Underwear use
was self-reported in a questionnaire and there may be misclassification of the exposure. The cross-sectional design limits causal inference,
and residual confounding is still possible owing to lack of information on other modifiable life styles that can also modify scrotal heat (e.g. type
of trousers worn, textile fabric of the underwear). Blood sampling was not limited to the morning and, as a result, we may have missed associations
with testosterone or other hormones with significant circadian variation despite statistical adjustment for time of blood draw.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Certain styles of male underwear may impair spermatogenesis and this may result in a
compensatory increase in gonadotrophin secretion, as reflected by higher serum FSH levels among men who reported most frequently},

  abstract      = {STUDY QUESTION
Are common lifestyle factors associated with low-motile sperm concentration (MSC)?

SUMMARY ANSWER
Common lifestyle choices make little contribution to the risk of low MSC.

WHAT IS KNOWN AND WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS
Reviews of male subfertility often highlight how aspects of men's adult lifestyle can significantly increase their risk of subfertility but the strength of supporting evidence is weak. In this study, although low MSC was associated with a history of testicular surgery, being in manual work, not wearing loose underwear and black ethnicity, no relation was found to consumption of alcohol, use of tobacco or recreational drugs or high body mass index (BMI). These results suggest that delaying assisted conception to make changes to lifestyle is unlikely to enhance conception.

DESIGN
Unmatched case-referent study with 939 cases and 1310 referents. Cases had a low-MSC relative to the time since last ejaculation (<12 × 106 for 3 days of abstinence). Exposures included self-reported exposures to alcohol, tobacco, recreational drugs as well as occupational and other factors.

PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING
Eligible men, aged 18 or above, were part of a couple who had been attempting conception without success following at least 12 months of unprotected intercourse and also had no knowledge of any semen analysis. They were recruited from 14 fertility clinics across the UK during a 37-month period from 1 January 1999.

MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE
Risk factors for low MSC, after adjustment for centre and confounding factors, included a history of testicular surgery [odds ratio = 2.39, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.75, 3.28], being in manual work [odds ratio (OR) = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.53] or not working (OR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.22, 2.59) and having black ethnicity (OR = 1.99, 95% CI: 1.10, 3.63). Conversely, men who wore boxer shorts (OR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.64, 0.92) or who had a previous conception (OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.60, 0.85) were less likely to be a case. No significant association was found with smoking and alcohol consumption, the use of recreational drugs, a high BMI or having a history of mumps or fever.

BIAS, CONFOUNDING AND OTHER REASONS FOR CAUTION
Data were collected blind to outcome, and exposure information should not have been subject to reporting bias. Among men attending the various clinics less than half met the study eligibility criteria and among those who did, two out of five were not recruited. It is not known whether any of those who refused to take part did so because they had a lifestyle they did not want subjected to investigation. Although the power of the study was sufficient to draw conclusions about common lifestyle choices, it cannot comment on exposures that are perhaps rare and poorly reported: the finding that use of street drugs was unrelated to low MSC cannot be assumed to apply to all such drugs and all patterns of use. The case definition did not consider sperm morphology or sperm DNA integrity.

GENERALIZABILITY TO OTHER POPULATIONS
All participating clinics saw patients at no cost (under the UK National Health Service) and the study population may differ from those in countries without such provision. Even within the UK, low-income couples may choose not to undertake any investigation believing that they would subsequently be unable to afford treatment.

STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S)
The study was funded by the UK Health and Safety Executive, the UK Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions, the UK Department of Health (grant code DoH 1216760) and the European Chemical Industry Council (grant code EMSG19). No competing interests declared.

expression of genes involved in heat stress and hypoxia?
summary answer: Scrotal hyperthermia by exposure to sauna can induce a significant alteration of spermatogenesis.
what is known already: Several authors have evidenced that high temperature has dramatic effects on spermatogenesis.
study design, size and duration: A longitudinal time-course study. Data from 10 subjects exposed to Finnish sauna were
collected before sauna (T0), after3 months of sauna sessions (T1) and after 3 (T2) and 6 months (T3) from the end of sauna exposure.
participants/materials, setting and methods: Ten normozoospermic volunteers underwent two sauna sessions per
week for 3 months, at 80 –908C, each lasting 15 min. Sex hormones, sperm parameters, sperm chromatin structure, sperm apoptosis and
expression of genes involved in heat stress and hypoxia were evaluated at the start, at the end of sauna exposure and after 3 and 6 months
from sauna discontinuation. Student’s t-test for paired data was used for statistical analysis.
main results and the role of chance: At the end of sauna exposure, we found a strong impairment of sperm count and
motility (P , 0.001), while no significant change in sex hormones was present. Decreases in the percentage of sperm with normal histoneprotamine
substitution (78.7+4.5 versus 69.0+4.1), chromatin condensation (70.7+4.7 versus 63.6+3.3) and mitochondrial function
(76.8+4.9 versus 54.0+6.1) were also evident at T1, and strong parallel up-regulation of genes involved in response to heat stress and
hypoxia was found. All these effects were completely reversed at T3.
limitations and reasons for caution: Absence of subjects with abnormal sperm parameters was the major limitation of
this study.
wider implications of the findings: Our data demonstrated for the first time that in normozoospermic subjects, sauna
exposure induces a significant but reversible impairment of spermatogenesis, including alteration of sperm parameters, mitochondrial function
and sperm DNA packaging. The large use of Finnish sauna in Nordic countries and its growing use in other parts of the world make it
important to consider the impact of this lifestyle choice on men’s fertility.
study funding/competing interest(s): No external funding was sought for this study and the authors have no conflict of
interest to declare.

Design: Prospective clinical study.
Setting: University academic medical center.
Patient(s): Twenty-one healthy male volunteers.
Intervention(s): The study consisted of a pretreatment period of 6 weeks, a treatment phase
of 52 weeks, and a recovery phase until return to normal sperm production. During the treatment
phase, the men wore polyester-lined athletic supports (single layer, double layer, or double layer
impregnated with aluminum) throughout the day.
Main Outcome Measure(s): Semen parameters and sperm function tests.
Result(s): In all three groups of subjects, scrotal temperature was consistently increased by
0.8 to 1°C while the subjects were wearing the athletic supports. Mean sperm concentration;
sperm motility, morphology, and viability; sperm hyperactivation; and ability of spermatozoa
to penetrate zone-free hamster oocytes were not affected by the increase in scrotal temperature.
Conclusion(s): The increase in scrotal temperature induced by polyester-lined athletic supports
was insufficient to cause significant suppression of spermatogenesis or alteration of sperm
function. (Fertil Sterila 1997; 68:334-g. 0 1997 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.)

  abstract      = {BACKGROUND
Reported declines in sperm counts remain controversial today and recent trends are unknown. A definitive meta-analysis is critical given the predictive value of sperm count for fertility, morbidity and mortality.

OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE
To provide a systematic review and meta-regression analysis of recent trends in sperm counts as measured by sperm concentration (SC) and total sperm count (TSC), and their modification by fertility and geographic group.

SEARCH METHODS
PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for English language studies of human SC published in 1981–2013. Following a predefined protocol 7518 abstracts were screened and 2510 full articles reporting primary data on SC were reviewed. A total of 244 estimates of SC and TSC from 185 studies of 42 935 men who provided semen samples in 1973–2011 were extracted for meta-regression analysis, as well as information on years of sample collection and covariates [fertility group (‘Unselected by fertility’ versus ‘Fertile’), geographic group (‘Western’, including North America, Europe Australia and New Zealand versus ‘Other’, including South America, Asia and Africa), age, ejaculation abstinence time, semen collection method, method of measuring SC and semen volume, exclusion criteria and indicators of completeness of covariate data]. The slopes of SC and TSC were estimated as functions of sample collection year using both simple linear regression and weighted meta-regression models and the latter were adjusted for pre-determined covariates and modification by fertility and geographic group. Assumptions were examined using multiple sensitivity analyses and nonlinear models.

OUTCOMES
SC declined significantly between 1973 and 2011 (slope in unadjusted simple regression models −0.70 million/ml/year; 95% CI: −0.72 to −0.69; P < 0.001; slope in adjusted meta-regression models = −0.64; −1.06 to −0.22; P = 0.003). The slopes in the meta-regression model were modified by fertility (P for interaction = 0.064) and geographic group (P for interaction = 0.027). There was a significant decline in SC between 1973 and 2011 among Unselected Western (−1.38; −2.02 to −0.74; P < 0.001) and among Fertile Western (−0.68; −1.31 to −0.05; P = 0.033), while no significant trends were seen among Unselected Other and Fertile Other. Among Unselected Western studies, the mean SC declined, on average, 1.4% per year with an overall decline of 52.4% between 1973 and 2011. Trends for TSC and SC were similar, with a steep decline among Unselected Western (−5.33 million/year, −7.56 to −3.11; P < 0.001), corresponding to an average decline in mean TSC of 1.6% per year and overall decline of 59.3%. Results changed minimally in multiple sensitivity analyses, and there was no statistical support for the use of a nonlinear model. In a model restricted to data post-1995, the slope both for SC and TSC among Unselected Western was similar to that for the entire period (−2.06 million/ml, −3.38 to −0.74; P = 0.004 and −8.12 million, −13.73 to −2.51, P = 0.006, respectively).

WIDER IMPLICATIONS
This comprehensive meta-regression analysis reports a significant decline in sperm counts (as measured by SC and TSC) between 1973 and 2011, driven by a 50–60% decline among men unselected by fertility from North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Because of the significant public health implications of these results, research on the causes of this continuing decline is urgently needed.

  abstract      = { Abstract Objectives: Premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMS/PMDD) bother a substantial number of women. Homeopathy seems a promising treatment, but it needs investigation using reliable study designs. The feasibility of organizing an international randomized pragmatic trial on a homeopathic add-on treatment (usual care [UC] + HT) compared with UC alone was evaluated. Design: A multicenter, randomized, controlled pragmatic trial with parallel groups. Settings/Location: The study was organized in general and private homeopathic practices in the Netherlands and Sweden and in an outpatient university clinic in Germany. Subjects: Women diagnosed as having PMS/PMDD, based on prospective daily rating by the daily record of severity of problems (DRSP) during a period of 2 months, were included and randomized. Interventions: Women were to receive UC + HT or UC for 4 months. Homeopathic medicine selection was according to a previously tested prognostic questionnaire and electronic algorithm. Usual care was as provided by the women's general practitioner according to their preferences. Outcome measures: Before and after treatment, the women completed diaries (DRSP), the measure yourself concerns and well-being, and other questionnaires. Intention-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) analyses were performed. Results: In Germany, the study could not proceed because of legal limitations. In Sweden, recruitment proved extremely difficult. In the Netherlands and Sweden, 60 women were randomized (UC + HT: 28; UC: 32), data of 47/46 women were analyzed (ITT/PP). After 4 months, relative mean change of DRSP scores in the UC + HT group was significantly better than in the UC group (p = 0.03). Conclusions: With respect to recruitment and different legal status, it does not seem feasible to perform a larger, international, pragmatic randomized trial on (semi-)individualized homeopathy for PMS/PMDD. Since the added value of HT compared with UC was demonstrated by significant differences in symptom score changes, further studies are warranted. },

We explored whether the association remained after longer follow-up with a near threefold increase in colorectal cancer cases, and if the association varied by gender and tumour location.   Methodology/Principal Findings After a mean follow-up of 11.0 years, 4,517 incident cases of colorectal cancer were documented. Total, cereal, fruit, and vegetable fibre intakes were estimated from dietary questionnaires at baseline. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models stratified by age, sex, and centre, and adjusted for total energy intake, body mass index, physical activity, smoking, education, menopausal status, hormone replacement therapy, oral contraceptive use, and intakes of alcohol, folate, red and processed meats, and calcium. After multivariable adjustments, total dietary fibre was inversely associated with colorectal cancer (HR per 10 g/day increase in fibre 0.87, 95% CI: 0.79–0.96). Similar linear associations were observed for colon and rectal cancers. The association between total dietary fibre and risk of colorectal cancer risk did not differ by age, sex, or anthropometric, lifestyle, and dietary variables. Fibre from cereals and fibre from fruit and vegetables were similarly associated with colon cancer; but for rectal cancer, the inverse association was only evident for fibre from cereals.   Conclusions/Significance Our results strengthen the evidence for the role of high dietary fibre intake in colorectal cancer prevention.},

To better understand how present-day breeds and populations reflect their introduction to the New World, N{\'\i} Leathlobhair et al. sequenced the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes of ancient dogs (see the Perspective by Goodman and Karlsson). The earliest New World dogs were not domesticated from North American wolves but likely originated from a Siberian ancestor. Furthermore, these lineages date back to a common ancestor that coincides with the first human migrations across Beringia. This lineage appears to have been mostly replaced by dogs introduced by Europeans, with the primary extant lineage remaining as a canine transmissible venereal tumor.Science, this issue p. 81; see also p. 27Dogs were present in the Americas before the arrival of European colonists, but the origin and fate of these precontact dogs are largely unknown. We sequenced 71 mitochondrial and 7 nuclear genomes from ancient North American and Siberian dogs from time frames spanning ~9000 years. Our analysis indicates that American dogs were not derived from North American wolves. Instead, American dogs form a monophyletic lineage that likely originated in Siberia and dispersed into the Americas alongside people. After the arrival of Europeans, native American dogs almost completely disappeared, leaving a minimal genetic legacy in modern dog populations. The closest detectable extant lineage to precontact American dogs is the canine transmissible venereal tumor, a contagious cancer clone derived from an individual dog that lived up to 8000 years ago.},

To ascertain the value of modern genetic data to elucidate the origins of dog domestication, we analyzed 49,024 autosomal SNPs in 1,375 dogs (representing 35 breeds) and 19 wolves. After combining our data with previously published data, we contrasted the genetic signatures of 121 breeds with a worldwide archeological assessment of the earliest dog remains. Correlating the earliest archeological dogs with the geographic locations of 14 so-called {\textquotedblleft}ancient{\textquotedblright} breeds (defined by their genetic differentiation) resulted in a counterintuitive pattern. First, none of the ancient breeds derive from regions where the oldest archeological remains have been found. Second, three of the ancient breeds (Basenjis, Dingoes, and New Guinea Singing Dogs) come from regions outside the natural range of Canis lupus (the dog{\textquoteright}s wild ancestor) and where dogs were introduced more than 10,000 y after domestication. These results demonstrate that the unifying characteristic among all genetically distinct so-called ancient breeds is a lack of recent admixture with other breeds likely facilitated by geographic and cultural isolation. Furthermore, these genetically distinct ancient breeds only appear so because of their relative isolation, suggesting that studies of modern breeds have yet to shed light on dog origins. We conclude by assessing the limitations of past studies and how next-generation sequencing of modern and ancient individuals may unravel the history of dog domestication.},

One course received a gamified curriculum, featuring a leaderboard and badges, whereas the other course received the same curriculum without the gamified elements. Our results found that students in the gamified course showed less motivation, satisfaction, and empowerment over time than those in the non-gamified class. The effect of course type on students' final exam scores was mediated by students' levels of intrinsic motivation, with students in the gamified course showing less motivation and lower final exam scores than the non-gamified class. This suggests that some care should be taken when applying certain gamification mechanics to educational settings.},

The results indicate that perceived enjoyment and usefulness of the gamification decline with use, suggesting that users might experience novelty effects from the service.

to read the to-be-remembered item aloud (lower cognitive control; i.e., Stroop-span task) or to name the font color of the
to-be-remembered item while still encoding the word for later recall (greater cognitive control; i.e., attention-impeded

bilinguals outperformed monolinguals on the attention-impeded Stroop-span task, but on neither the operation-span nor the
Stroop-span task. Our findings demonstrate that bilingualism provides advantages in controlled processing, an important
component of WM and other executive functions, suggesting that the demand for controlled processing in WM tasks
moderates bilingual effects on WM.

question is typically addressed by determining whether concurrent storage of 2 different memory arrays
produces interference. Prior studies using this approach have shown at least some cost to maintaining 2
memory arrays that differed in perceptual modalities. However, it is not clear whether these WM costs
resulted from competition for a central, capacity-limited store or from other potential sources of dual-task
interference, such as task preparation and coordination, overlap in representational content (e.g., object
vs. space based), or cognitive strategies (e.g., verbalization, chunking of the stimulus material in a higher
order structure). In the present study we assess dual-task costs during the concurrent performance of a
visuospatial WM task and an auditory object WM task when such sources of interference are minimized.
The results show that performance of these 2 WM tasks are independent from each another, even at high
WM load. Only when we introduced a common representational format (spatial information) to both WM
tasks did dual-task performance begin to suffer. These results are inconsistent with the notion of a
domain-independent storage system, and suggest instead that WM is constrained by multiple domainspecific
stores and central executive processes. Evidently, there is nothing intrinsic about the functional
architecture of the human mind that prevents it from storing 2 distinct representations in WM, as long
as these representations do not overlap in any functional domain.

ways. The studies that reported a decrease used displays with heterogeneous stimuli and tasks with a short-term memory
component, while the ones that reported constancy used homogeneous stimuli and tasks that did not require short-term
memory. To disentangle the effects of heterogeneity and short-memory involvement, we conducted two main experiments.
In Experiment 1, stimuli were heterogeneous, and we compared a condition in which target identity was revealed before the
stimulus display with one in which it was revealed afterward. In Experiment 2, target identity was fixed, and we compared
heterogeneous and homogeneous distractor conditions. In both experiments, we compared an optimal-observer model in
which precision is constant with set size with one in which it depends on set size. We found that precision decreases with set
size when the distractors are heterogeneous, regardless of whether short-term memory is involved, but not when it is
homogeneous. This suggests that heterogeneity, not short-term memory, is the critical factor. In addition, we found that
precision exhibits variability across items and trials, which may partly be caused by attentional fluctuations.

Current theories typically account for this "set size effect" by postulating a hard constraint on the allocated amount of encoding resource. While these theories have produced models that are descriptively successful, they offer no principled explanation for the very existence of set size effects: given their detrimental consequences for behavioral performance, why have these effects not been weeded out by evolutionary pressure, by allocating resources proportionally to the number of encoded items? Here, we propose a theory that is based on an ecological notion of rationality: set size effects are the result of a near-optimal trade-off between behavioral performance and the neural costs associated with stimulus encoding. We derive models for four visual working memory and attention tasks and show that they account well for data from eleven previously published experiments. Moreover, our results suggest that the total amount of resource that subjects allocate for stimulus encoding varies non-monotonically with set size, which is consistent with our rational theory of set size effects but not with previous descriptive theories. Altogether, our findings suggest that set size effects may have a rational basis and highlight the importance of considering ecological costs in theories of human cognition.},

Tack vare ditt arbetsminne kan du läsa denna mening från början till slut, utan att glömma bort innebörden i meningen. Arbetsminnet är ett system som tillfälligt lagrar information som är relevant för den uppgift du utför. Men ju fler saker du försöker hålla i arbetsminnet samtidigt, desto sämre blir kvaliteten på vart och ett av minnena. Detta fenomen  är känt som ”set size effect”.

Det har länge hävdats att fenomenet inträffar eftersom hjärnan använder en viss mängd neurala resurser till arbetsminnet. Men denna teori det förklarar inte varför hjärnan inte använder ytterligare resurser när den har fler saker att komma ihåg. Hjärtat slår ju till exempel snabbare när du ökar din fysiska aktivitet.

Forskarna Van den Berg och Ma bryter med teorin att arbetsminnets resurser är fasta. Istället föreslår de att resursallokeringen är flexibel och drivs av en balansering mellan två motstridiga mål: att maximera minnesprestanda, och att använda så få neurala resurser som möjligt.

Bättre minne genom belöningar
De överförde idén till en beräkningsmodell som de testade på data från nio tidigare publicerade experiment. I experimenten skulle försökspersonerna memorera färger på olika antal objekt. När de sedan ombads att återge färgerna så exakt som möjligt, visade det sig att kvaliteten på deras svar påverkades negativt av hur många objekt de försökte hålla i i minnet.

Modellen som  Van den Berg och Ma tagit fram, kunde förklara resultaten från samtliga nio dataset. Deras modellsimuleringar förutsäger även att de objekt som är mest relevanta för en uppgift lagras mer exakt än de som är mindre viktiga, vilket är ett fenomen som också observerats hos deltagarna i experimenten. Dessutom förutspår  simuleringen att den totala mängden resurser som ägnas åt arbetsminnet varierar med antalet objekt som ska memoreras. Detta resultat är förenligt med resultaten från tidigare experiment.

Arbetsminnet verkar alltså vara mer flexibelt än man tidigare trott. Mängden resurser som hjärnan allokerar till arbetsminnet är inte fast, utan kan vara ett resultat av att balansera resurskostnaden mot kognitiv prestanda. Om detta bekräftas kan det vara möjligt att förbättra arbetsminnet genom att erbjuda belöningar eller genom att öka den upplevda betydelsen av en uppgift.

In recent years, however, the advent and vigorous growth of the online dating industry has provided a rich new source of information on mate pursuit. We present an empirical analysis of heterosexual dating markets in four large U.S. cities using data from a popular, free online dating service. We show that competition for mates creates a pronounced hierarchy of desirability that correlates strongly with user demographics and is remarkably consistent across cities. We find that both men and women pursue partners who are on average about 25\% more desirable than themselves by our measures and that they use different messaging strategies with partners of different desirability. We also find that the probability of receiving a response to an advance drops markedly with increasing difference in desirability between the pursuer and the pursued. Strategic behaviors can improve one{\textquoteright}s chances of attracting a more desirable mate, although the effects are modest.},

  abstract      = {The European flounder Platichthys flesus (Linnaeus, 1758) displays two contrasting reproductive behaviors in the Baltic Sea: offshore spawning of pelagic eggs and coastal spawning of demersal eggs, a behavior observed exclusively in the Baltic Sea. Previous studies showed marked differences in behavioral, physiological, and life-history traits of flounders with pelagic and demersal eggs. Furthermore, a recent study demonstrated that flounders with pelagic and demersal eggs represent two reproductively isolated, parapatric species arising from two distinct colonization events from the same ancestral population. Using morphological data we first established that the syntypes on which the original description of P. flesus was based belong to the pelagic-spawning lineage. We then used a combination of morphological and physiological characters as well as genome-wide genetic data to describe flounders with demersal eggs as a new species: Platichthys solemdali sp. nov. The new species can be clearly distinguished from P. flesus based on egg morphology, egg and sperm physiology as well as via population genetic and phylogenetic analyses. While the two species do show some minor morphological differences in the number of anal and dorsal fin rays, no external morphological feature can be used to unambiguously identify individuals to species. Therefore, we developed a simple molecular diagnostic test able to unambiguously distinguish P. solemdali from P. flesus with a single PCR reaction, a tool that should be useful to fishery scientists and managers, as well as to ecologists studying these species.},

  abstract      = {Abstract Adolescence refers to the period of physical and psychological development between childhood and adulthood. The beginning of adolescence is loosely anchored to the onset of puberty, which brings dramatic alterations in hormone levels and a number of consequent physical changes. Puberty onset is also associated with profound changes in drives, motivations, psychology, and social life; these changes continue throughout adolescence. There is an increasing number of neuroimaging studies looking at the development of the brain, both structurally and functionally, during adolescence. Almost all of these studies have defined development by chronological age, which shows a strong—but not unitary—correlation with pubertal stage. Very few neuroimaging studies have associated brain development with pubertal stage, and yet there is tentative evidence to suggest that puberty might play an important role in some aspects of brain and cognitive development. In this paper we describe this research, and we suggest that, in the future, developmental neuroimaging studies of adolescence should consider the role of puberty.

  abstract      = {The term 'social brain' refers to the network of brain regions that are involved in understanding others. Behaviour that is related to social cognition changes dramatically during human adolescence. This is paralleled by functional changes that occur in the social brain during this time, in particular in the medial prefrontal cortex and the superior temporal sulcus, which show altered activity during the performance of social cognitive tasks, such as face recognition and mental-state attribution. Research also indicates that, in humans, these parts of the social brain undergo structural development, including synaptic reorganization, during adolescence. Bringing together two relatively new and rapidly expanding areas of neuroscience — social neuroscience and the study of brain development during adolescence — will increase our understanding of how the social brain develops during adolescence.

Key points
The 'social brain' is the network of brain regions that are involved in understanding other people, and includes the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). These regions are key to the process of mentalizing — that is, the attribution of mental states to oneself and to other people.

Recent functional neuroimaging research has shown that activity in parts of the social brain during social cognitive tasks changes during adolescence.

In particular, there is some indication that activity in the PFC during face-processing tasks increases from childhood to adolescence and then decreases from adolescence to adulthood. Consistent with this, there is evidence that activity in the mPFC during mentalizing tasks decreases between adolescence and adulthood.

The prefrontal cortex is one of the brain regions that undergo structural development, including synaptic reorganization, during adolescence. Synaptic density, reflected in grey-matter volume in MRI scans, decreases during adolescence.

It is argued that the synaptic reorganization in the PFC might underlie the functional changes that are seen in the social brain during adolescence, as well as the social cognitive changes that are characteristic of this period of life.},

This process is predicted to be the most significant term in the global hydrogen cycle. However, the organisms and enzymes responsible for this process were only recently identified. Pure culture experiments demonstrated that several species of Actinobacteria, including streptomycetes and mycobacteria, can couple the oxidation of atmospheric H(2) to the reduction of ambient O(2). A combination of genetic, biochemical, and phenotypic studies suggest that these organisms primarily use this fuel source to sustain electron input into the respiratory chain during energy starvation. This process is mediated by a specialized enzyme, the group 5 [NiFe]-hydrogenase, which is unusual for its high affinity, oxygen insensitivity, and thermostability. Atmospheric hydrogen scavenging is a particularly dependable mode of energy generation, given both the ubiquity of the substrate and the stress tolerance of its catalyst. This minireview summarizes the recent progress in understanding how and why certain organisms scavenge atmospheric H(2). In addition, it provides insight into the wider significance of hydrogen scavenging in global H(2) cycling and soil microbial ecology.},

  abstract      = { The literature on the distribution, budget and isotope content of molecular hydrogen (H2) in the troposphere is critically reviewed. The global distribution of H2 is reasonably well established and is relatively uniform. The surface measurements exhibit a weak latitudinal gradient with 3\% higher concentrations in the Southern Hemisphere and seasonal variations that maximize in arctic latitudes and the interior of continents with peak-to-peak amplitudes up to 10\%. There is no evidence for a continuous long-term trend, but older data suggest a reversal of the interhemispheric gradient in the late 1970s, and an increase in the deuterium content of H2 in the Northern Hemisphere from 80 standard mean ocean water (SMOW) in the 1970s to 130 today. The current budget analyses can be divided in two classes: bottom up, in which the source and sink terms are estimated separately based on emission factors and turnovers of precursors and on global integration of regional loss rates, respectively. That category includes the analyses by 3-D models and furnishes tropospheric turnovers around 75 Tg H2 yr−1. The other approach, referred to as top down, relies on inverse modelling or analysis of the deuterium budget of tropospheric H2. These provide a global turnover of about 105 Tg H2 yr−1. The difference is due to a much larger sink strength by soil uptake and a much larger H2 production from the photochemical oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the case of the top down approaches. The balance of evidence seems to favour the lower estimates—mainly due to the constraint placed by the global CO budget on the H2 production from VOC. An update of the major source and sink terms yields: fossil fuel use 11±4 TgH2 yr−1; biomass burning (including bio-fuel) 15 ± 6 Tg H2 yr−1; nitrogen fixation (ocean) 6 ± 3 Tg H2 yr−1; nitrogen fixation (land) 3 ± 2 Tg H2 yr−1; photochemical production from CH4 23 ± 8 Tg H2 yr−1 and photochemical production from other VOC 18 ± 7 Tg H2 yr−1. The loss through reaction of H2 with OH is 19 ± 5 Tg H2 yr−1, and soil uptake 60+30 −20 Tg H2 yr−1. All these rates are well within the ranges of the corresponding bottom up estimates in the literature. The total loss of 79 Tg H2 yr−1 combined with a tropospheric burden of 155 Tg H2 yields a tropospheric H2 lifetime of 2 yr. Besides these major sources of H2, there are a number of minor ones with source strengths > 1 Tg H2 yr−1. Rough estimates for these are also given. },

the atmosphere is dominated by the uptake in soils. Notwithstanding,
estimates of the magnitude of this important process
on a global scale are highly uncertain. The CARIBIC
aircraft observations of the seasonal variations of H2 and its
D/H isotopic ratio in the Northern Hemisphere allow an independent,
better constrained estimate. We derive that 82%
of the annual turnover of tropospheric H2 is due to soil uptake,
equaling 88 (±11) Tg a−1
, of which the Northern Hemisphere
alone accounts for 62 (±10) Tg a−1
. Our calculations
further show that tropospheric H2 has a lifetime of only
1.4 (±0.2) years – significantly shorter than the recent estimate
of ∼2 years – which is expected to decrease in the future.
In addition, our independent top-down approach, confined
by the global and hemispheric sinks of H2, indicates
64 (±12) Tg a−1
emissions from various sources of volatile
organic compounds by photochemical oxidation in the atmosphere.
This estimate is as much as up to 60% larger than
the previous estimates. This large airborne production of H2
helps to explain the fairly homogeneous distribution of H2 in
the troposphere.},

meta-regression models and investigated potential sources of heterogeneity.
Results: A total of 572 studies, including 486 538 cancer cases, were identified. Relative risks (RRs) for heavy drinkers compared
with nondrinkers and occasional drinkers were 5.13 for oral and pharyngeal cancer, 4.95 for oesophageal squamous

dose–risk relationship. Heavy drinkers also had a significantly higher risk of cancer of the stomach (RR 1.21), liver (2.07), gallbladder

melanoma and prostate cancer. Alcohol consumption and risk of Hodgkin’s and Non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas were inversely
associated.
Conclusions: Alcohol increases risk of cancer of oral cavity and pharynx, oesophagus, colorectum, liver, larynx and female breast.
There is accumulating evidence that alcohol drinking is associated with some other cancers such as pancreas and prostate cancer

the effects of alcohol. Protective effects of moderate drinking are reported for cardiovascular
disease, diabetes type 2 and cognitive functioning. However, moderate
drinking also involves risks, especially of injuries, violence, foetal damage,
certain forms of cancer, liver disease and hypertension. Alcohol consumption
should not be recommended for health reasons. Binge drinking, regardless of age,
is a medical risk. Health professionals should discuss the pattern of drinking with
patients, especially binge drinking, to a larger extent than is usually the case today.

Måttligt drickande har små hälsoeffekter. Skyddande
effekter rapporteras för hjärt–kärlsjukdomar, diabetes
och kognitiva funktioner.
Även måttlig alkoholkonsumtion innebär vissa hälsorisker,
främst för fosterskador, vissa cancerformer,
leversjukdomar, olycksfall, våld och högt blodtryck.
Risken med alkohol är störst för unga människor och
avtar sedan med stigande ålder. Kvinnor är mer känsliga
för alkohol än män.
Det finns ingen anledning att offentligt rekommendera
alkoholkonsumtion från hälsosynpunkt.
Berusningsdrickande är, oavsett ålder, en medicinsk
risk.
Vårdpersonal bör diskutera konsumtionsmönster, i
synnerhet berusningsdrickande, i samtal med patienter
betydligt mer än vad som vanligen sker.},

Design Mendelian randomisation meta-analysis of 56 epidemiological studies. Participants 261 991 individuals of European descent, including 20 259 coronary heart disease cases and 10 164 stroke events. Data were available on ADH1B rs1229984 variant, alcohol phenotypes, and cardiovascular biomarkers. Main outcome measures Odds ratio for coronary heart disease and stroke associated with the ADH1B variant in all individuals and by categories of alcohol consumption. Results Carriers of the A-allele of ADH1B rs1229984 consumed 17.2\% fewer units of alcohol per week (95\% confidence interval 15.6\% to 18.9\%), had a lower prevalence of binge drinking (odds ratio 0.78 (95\% CI 0.73 to 0.84)), and had higher abstention (odds ratio 1.27 (1.21 to 1.34)) than non-carriers. Rs1229984 A-allele carriers had lower systolic blood pressure (-0.88 (-1.19 to -0.56) mm Hg), interleukin-6 levels (-5.2\% (-7.8 to -2.4\%)), waist circumference (-0.3 (-0.6 to -0.1) cm), and body mass index (-0.17 (-0.24 to -0.10) kg/m2). Rs1229984 A-allele carriers had lower odds of coronary heart disease (odds ratio 0.90 (0.84 to 0.96)). The protective association of the ADH1B rs1229984 A-allele variant remained the same across all categories of alcohol consumption (P=0.83 for heterogeneity). Although no association of rs1229984 was identified with the combined subtypes of stroke, carriers of the A-allele had lower odds of ischaemic stroke (odds ratio 0.83 (0.72 to 0.95)). Conclusions Individuals with a genetic variant associated with non-drinking and lower alcohol consumption had a more favourable cardiovascular profile and a reduced risk of coronary heart disease than those without the genetic variant. This suggests that reduction of alcohol consumption, even for light to moderate drinkers, is beneficial for cardiovascular health.},

Fetal alcohol syndrome is not the only consequence
of prenatal alcohol exposure
The prevalence of fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal
alcohol spectrum disorders in larger communities in
USA is now updated to 0.4 % and 4.8 % respectively.
Affected individuals bear witness to disease symptoms
from many organ systems in addition to the brain
and behavioural dysfunctions. In the light of modern
epigenetic research, early alcohol exposure appears
to play a hidden role in fetal reprogramming. The
underlying mechanisms explain the »developmental
origin of health and disease«, which has an impact on
complex interactions between genome, environment
and epigenetics.

Fetala alkoholspektrumstörningar är vanligare än tidigare känt.

Prenatal alkoholexponering påverkar fler organsystem än hjärnan.

Epigenetisk forskning visar att alkohol­exponering tidigt i fosterlivet orsakar omprogrammering med negativ inverkan för framtida hälsa. 

Det säkraste är att helt avstå från alkohol under hela graviditeten.},

Alkohol, narkotika och tobak bidrar till omfattande ohälsa, men det har inte funnits något enkelt mått för att sammanfatta detta. Ofta har man talat om antal döda på grund av alkohol eller tobaksbruk. 

DALY (disability adjusted life years; funktionsjusterade levnadsår) har tagits fram inom det globala sjukdomsbördeprojektet och är ett allt oftare använt mått på sjukdomsbörda. 

Det som specifikt mäts i DALY är den tid i år som man förlorar på grund av för tidig död (YLL; years of life lost) och sjukdom (YLD; years lived with disability).

Riskskattningar och prevalensdata bygger på omfattande genomgång av litteratur och grunddata från olika länder med hjälp av internationella expertgrupper. 

DALY ger ett sammanfattande mått på sjukdomsbörda som olika riskfaktorer bidrar till. Med DALY-måttet kan jämförelser göras mellan länder, tidsperioder, åldersgrupper och sjukdomsdia­gnoser, vilket kan ge värdefull information för riktade insatser.

summary
Various attempts have been made to measure the burden of alcohol,
drugs and tobacco smoking on population health, and mortality is an
often used measure. As part of the governmental strategy to prevent
use of alcohol, drugs, doping and tobacco (ANDT) in Sweden, we
assessed disease burden measured by DALY (Disability Adjusted Life
Years), attributed to alcohol, drugs and tobacco over time, as an overall
indicator of problem level. DALY was developed within the Global
Burden of Disease study (GBD), and combines life lost to premature
death (YLL) and years lived with disability (YLD) in one measure.
In 2010 tobacco contributed to 7.7% of the total disease burden in
Sweden, followed by alcohol (3.4%) and drugs (1.3%). The disease
burden caused by tobacco has decreased substantially since 1990,
while small changes are observed for alcohol and drugs. Much of the
disease burden specially related to drugs and alcohol was related to
YLD, which can be captured with the DALY measure.},

  abstract      = {In most species the reproductive system ages at the same rate as somatic tissue and individuals continue reproducing until death. However, females of three species - humans, killer whales and short-finned pilot whales - have been shown to display a markedly increased rate of reproductive senescence relative to somatic ageing. In these species, a significant proportion of females live beyond their reproductive lifespan: they have a post-reproductive lifespan. Research into this puzzling life-history strategy is hindered by the difficulties of quantifying the rate of reproductive senescence in wild populations. Here we present a method for measuring the relative rate of reproductive senescence in toothed whales using published physiological data. Of the sixteen species for which data are available (which does not include killer whales), we find that three have a significant post-reproductive lifespan: short-finned pilot whales, beluga whales and narwhals. Phylogenetic reconstruction suggests that female post-reproductive lifespans have evolved several times independently in toothed whales. Our study is the first evidence of a significant post-reproductive lifespan in beluga whales and narwhals which, when taken together with the evidence for post-reproductive lifespan in killer whales, doubles the number of non-human mammals known to exhibit post-reproductive lifespans in the wild.},

Local group relatedness increases with age in female killer whales
Young females are predicted to invest more in reproductive competition
The costs of co-breeding with kin are greater for old compared to young females
Summary
Why females of some species cease ovulation prior to the end of their natural lifespan is a long-standing evolutionary puzzle [1, 2, 3, 4]. The fitness benefits of post-reproductive helping could in principle select for menopause [1, 2, 5], but the magnitude of these benefits appears insufficient to explain the timing of menopause [6, 7, 8]. Recent theory suggests that the cost of inter-generational reproductive conflict between younger and older females of the same social unit is a critical missing term in classical inclusive fitness calculations (the “reproductive conflict hypothesis” [6, 9]). Using a unique long-term dataset on wild resident killer whales, where females can live decades after their final parturition, we provide the first test of this hypothesis in a non-human animal. First, we confirm previous theoretical predictions that local relatedness increases with female age up to the end of reproduction. Second, we construct a new evolutionary model and show that given these kinship dynamics, selection will favor younger females that invest more in competition, and thus have greater reproductive success, than older females (their mothers) when breeding at the same time. Third, we test this prediction using 43 years of individual-based demographic data in resident killer whales and show that when mothers and daughters co-breed, the mortality hazard of calves from older-generation females is 1.7 times that of calves from younger-generation females. Intergenerational conflict combined with the known benefits conveyed to kin by post-reproductive females can explain why killer whales have evolved the longest post-reproductive lifespan of all non-human animals.},

  abstract      = {Abstract Fifteen female rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatto), ranging in age from 8 to 34 years, were studied for one year to characterize the endocrine and menstrual changes associated with menopause in this species. Five monkeys were premenopausal; these younger monkeys, ages 8–11 years, menstruated and showed cyclic ovarian activity during the 12–month study period, as evidenced by menses and periodic elevations of serum estradiol (E2) and luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations. Four females, ages 24–26 years, were in transition to menopause. Two of these perimenopausal females menstruated and secreted E2 and LH in a periodic fashion; the other two females showed elevated LH concentrations, consistently low E2 levels, and no evidence of menstruation. Six females, ages 27–34 years, were clearly postmenopausal; LH concentrations were high, whereas E2 concentrations were uniformly low. There was a significant inverse correlation between basal E2 concentrations and age, and a significant positive correlation between age and LH concentrations across all 15 animals. Hormonal changes indicative of ovulation, when they occurred, were generally restricted to the winter and early spring months. Histological analysis of ovaries from four postmenopausal females revealed little or no evidence of active folliculogenesis. These data indicate that menopause in female rhesus monkeys does not occur until the second half of thethird decade of life. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract      = {Abstract Human menopause is ubiquitous among women and is uninfluenced by modernity. In addition, it remains an evolutionary puzzle: studies have largely failed to account for diminishing selection on reproduction beyond 50 years. Using a 200-year dataset on pre-industrial Finns, we show that an important component is between-generation reproductive conflict among unrelated women. Simultaneous reproduction by successive generations of in-laws was associated with declines in offspring survivorship of up to 66\%. An inclusive fitness model revealed that incorporation of the fitness consequences of simultaneous intergenerational reproduction between in-laws, with those of grandmothering and risks of dying in childbirth, were sufficient to generate selection against continued reproduction beyond 51 years. Decomposition of model estimates suggested that the former two were most influential in generating selection against continued reproduction. We propose that menopause evolved, in part, because of age-specific increases in opportunities for intergenerational cooperation and reproductive competition under ecological scarcity.},

Classic life-history theory predicts that menopause should not occur because there should be no selection for survival after the cessation of reproduction [1]. Yet, human females routinely live 30 years after they have stopped reproducing [2]. Only two other species—killer whales (Orcinus orca) and short-finned pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus) [3, 4]—have comparable postreproductive lifespans. In theory, menopause can evolve via inclusive fitness benefits [5, 6], but the mechanisms by which postreproductive females help their kin remain enigmatic. One hypothesis is that postreproductive females act as repositories of ecological knowledge and thereby buffer kin against environmental hardships [7, 8]. We provide the first test of this hypothesis using a unique long-term dataset on wild resident killer whales. We show three key results. First, postreproductively aged females lead groups during collective movement in salmon foraging grounds. Second, leadership by postreproductively aged females is especially prominent in difficult years when salmon abundance is low. This finding is critical because salmon abundance drives both mortality and reproductive success in resident killer whales [9, 10]. Third, females are more likely to lead their sons than they are to lead their daughters, supporting predictions of recent models [5] of the evolution of menopause based on kinship dynamics. Our results show that postreproductive females may boost the fitness of kin through the transfer of ecological knowledge. The value gained from the wisdom of elders can help explain why female resident killer whales and humans continue to live long after they have stopped reproducing.},

Due to the threat domoic acid can pose to public health, marine wildlife, and coastal economies, decades of laboratory experiments have examined controls on domoic acid production without reaching consensus on reliable toxin-producing conditions. Our findings reveal an association between domoic acid in shellfish and climate-scale warm ocean conditions, a unique, large-scale perspective relative to previous work.Domoic acid is a potent neurotoxin produced by certain marine microalgae that can accumulate in the foodweb, posing a health threat to human seafood consumers and wildlife in coastal regions worldwide. Evidence of climatic regulation of domoic acid in shellfish over the past 20 y in the Northern California Current regime is shown. The timing of elevated domoic acid is strongly related to warm phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the Oceanic Ni{\~n}o Index, an indicator of El Ni{\~n}o events. Ocean conditions in the northeast Pacific that are associated with warm phases of these indices, including changes in prevailing currents and advection of anomalously warm water masses onto the continental shelf, are hypothesized to contribute to increases in this toxin. We present an applied domoic acid risk assessment model for the US West Coast based on combined climatic and local variables. Evidence of regional- to basin-scale controls on domoic acid has not previously been presented. Our findings have implications in coastal zones worldwide that are affected by this toxin and are particularly relevant given the increased frequency of anomalously warm ocean conditions.},

For plants, 85\% of species occur entirely within just over a third of the Earth{\textquoteright}s land surface, carefully optimized to maximize the species captured. Well-known vertebrate taxa show similar patterns. Protecting half of Earth might not be necessary, but would it be sufficient given the current trends of protection? The predilection of national governments is to protect areas that are {\textquotedblleft}wild,{\textquotedblright} that is, typically remote, cold, or arid. Unfortunately, those areas often hold relatively few species. Wild places likely afford the easier opportunities for the future expansion of protected areas, with the expansion into human-dominated landscapes the greater challenge. We identify regions that are not currently protected, but that are wild, and consider which of them hold substantial numbers of especially small-ranged vertebrate species. We assess how successful the strategy of protecting the wilder half of Earth might be in conserving biodiversity. It is far from sufficient. (Protecting large wild places for reasons other than biodiversity protection, such as carbon sequestration and other ecosystem services, might still have importance.) Unexpectedly, we also show that, despite the bias in establishing large protected areas in wild places to date, numerous small protected areas are in biodiverse places. They at least partially protect significant fractions of especially small-ranged species. So, while a preoccupation with protecting large areas for the sake of getting half of Earth might achieve little for biodiversity, there is more progress in protecting high-biodiversity areas than currently appreciated. Continuing to prioritize the right parts of Earth, not just the total area protected, is what matters for biodiversity.},

Background
The flipped classroom has generated interest in higher education providing a student-centred approach to learning. This has the potential to engage nursing students in ways that address the needs of today's students and the complexity of contemporary healthcare. Calls for educational reform, particularly in healthcare programs such as nursing, highlight the need for students to problem-solve, reason and apply theory into practice. The drivers towards student-based learning have manifested in team, problem and case-based learning models. Though there has been a shift towards the flipped classroom, comparatively little is known about how it is used in nursing curricula.
Objectives
The aims of this systematic review were to examine how the flipped classroom has been applied in nursing education and outcomes associated with this style of teaching.
Data Sources
Five databases were searched and resulted in the retrieval of 21 papers: PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, Scopus and ERIC.
Review Methods
After screening for inclusion/exclusion criteria, each paper was evaluated using a critical appraisal tool. Data extraction and analysis were completed on all included studies.
Results
This systematic review screened 21 titles and abstracts resulting in nine included studies. All authors critically appraised the quality of the included studies. Five studies were identified and themes identified were: academic performance outcomes, and student satisfaction implementing the flipped classroom.
Conclusions
Use of the flipped classroom in higher education nursing programmes yielded neutral or positive academic outcomes and mixed results for satisfaction. Engagement of students in the flipped classroom model was achieved when academics informed and rationalised the purpose of the flipped classroom model to students. However, no studies in this review identified the evaluation of the process of implementing the flipped classroom. Studies examining the process and ongoing evaluation and refinement of the flipped classroom in higher education nursing programmes are warranted.},

Deforestation is a major driver of climate change1 and the major driver of biodiversity loss1,2. Yet the essential baseline for monitoring forest cover—the global area of forests—remains uncertain despite rapid technological advances and international consensus on conserving target extents of ecosystems3. Previous satellite-based estimates4,5 of global forest area range from 32.1  ×  106 km2 to 41.4  ×  106 km2. Here, we show that the major reason underlying this discrepancy is ambiguity in the term ‘forest’. Each of the >800 official definitions6 that are capable of satellite measurement relies on a criterion of percentage tree cover. This criterion may range from >10% to >30% cover under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change7. Applying the range to the first global, high-resolution map of percentage tree cover8 reveals a discrepancy of 19.3  ×  106 km2, some 13% of Earth’s land area. The discrepancy within the tropics alone involves a difference of 45.2 Gt C of biomass, valued at US$1 trillion. To more effectively link science and policy to ecosystems, we must now refine forest monitoring, reporting and verification to focus on ecological measurements that are more directly relevant to ecosystem function, to biomass and carbon, and to climate and biodiversity.},

The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) aspires to formal protection of at least 17\% of the terrestrial world and, through the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation, 60\% of plant species. Are these targets of protecting area and species compatible? We show that 67\% of plant species live entirely within regions that comprise 17\% of the land surface. Moreover, these regions include most terrestrial vertebrates with small geographical ranges. However, the connections between the CBD targets of protecting area and species are complex. Achieving both targets will be difficult because regions with the most plant species have only slightly more land protected than do those with fewer.},

We identify several important areas currently ignored by biodiversity hotspots, the current leading priority map. As the window of opportunity for expanding the global protected area network begins to close, identifying priorities at a scale practical for local action ensures our findings will help protect biodiversity most effectively.Identifying priority areas for biodiversity is essential for directing conservation resources. Fundamentally, we must know where individual species live, which ones are vulnerable, where human actions threaten them, and their levels of protection. As conservation knowledge and threats change, we must reevaluate priorities. We mapped priority areas for vertebrates using newly updated data on \&gt;21,000 species of mammals, amphibians, and birds. For each taxon, we identified centers of richness for all species, small-ranged species, and threatened species listed with the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Importantly, all analyses were at a spatial grain of 10 {\texttimes} 10 km, 100 times finer than previous assessments. This fine scale is a significant methodological improvement, because it brings mapping to scales comparable with regional decisions on where to place protected areas. We also mapped recent species discoveries, because they suggest where as-yet-unknown species might be living. To assess the protection of the priority areas, we calculated the percentage of priority areas within protected areas using the latest data from the World Database of Protected Areas, providing a snapshot of how well the planet{\textquoteright}s protected area system encompasses vertebrate biodiversity. Although the priority areas do have more protection than the global average, the level of protection still is insufficient given the importance of these areas for preventing vertebrate extinctions. We also found substantial differences between our identified vertebrate priorities and the leading map of global conservation priorities, the biodiversity hotspots. Our findings suggest a need to reassess the global allocation of conservation resources to reflect today{\textquoteright}s improved knowledge of biodiversity and conservation.},

  abstract      = {Giant vertebrates dominated many Pleistocene ecosystems. Many were herbivores, and their sudden extinction in prehistory could have had large ecological impacts. We used a high-resolution 130,000-year environmental record to help resolve the cause and reconstruct the ecological consequences of extinction of Australia{\textquoteright}s megafauna. Our results suggest that human arrival rather than climate caused megafaunal extinction, which then triggered replacement of mixed rainforest by sclerophyll vegetation through a combination of direct effects on vegetation of relaxed herbivore pressure and increased fire in the landscape. This ecosystem shift was as large as any effect of climate change over the last glacial cycle, and indicates the magnitude of changes that may have followed megafaunal extinction elsewhere in the world.},

In 2015, a sample of 326 pupils aged 9-11 years old from 19 classes at three selected primary schools were randomly assigned to control and experimental groups within the study. During the classes, children in the experimental group performed physical activities two times per day in three to five minutes using Brain Breaks(®) videos for four months, while the control group did not use the videos during the test period. Students’ attitudes toward physical activities were assessed before and after the intervention using the “Attitudes toward Physical Activity Scale”. Repeated measures of ANOVA were used to examine the change from pre- to post-intervention. Overall, a repeated measures ANOVA indicated time-by-group interaction effects in ‘Self-efficacy on learning with video exercises’, F(1.32) = 75.28, p = 0.00, η(2) = 0.19. Although the changes are minor, there were benefits of the intervention.

  abstract      = {Abstract To meet the expanding land use required for wind energy development, a better understanding of the effects on terrestrial animals’ responses to such development is required. Using GPS-data from 50 freely ranging female reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) in the Malå reindeer herding community, Sweden, we determined reindeer calving sites and estimated reindeer habitat selection using resource selection functions (RSF). RSFs were estimated at both second- (selection of home range) and third-order (selection within home range) scale in relation to environmental variables, wind farm (WF) development phase (before construction, construction, and operation), distance to the WFs and at the second-order scale whether the wind turbines were in or out of sight of the reindeer. We found that the distance between reindeer calving site and WFs increased during the operation phase, compared to before construction. At both scales of selection, we found a significant decrease in habitat selection of areas in proximity of the WFs, in the same comparison. The results also revealed a shift in home range selection away from habitats where wind turbines became visible toward habitats where the wind turbines were obscured by topography (increase in use by 79\% at 5 km). We interpret the reindeer shift in home range selection as an effect of the wind turbines per se. Using topography and land cover information together with the positions of wind turbines could therefore help identify sensitive habitats for reindeer and improve the planning and placement of WFs. In addition, we found that operation phase of these WFs had a stronger adverse impact on reindeer habitat selection than the construction phase. Thus, the continuous running of the wind turbines making a sound both day and night seemed to have disturbed the reindeer more than the sudden sounds and increased human activity during construction work.},

  abstract      = {The Arctic has extreme seasonal changes in light levels and is proportionally UV-rich because of scattering of the shorter wavelengths and their reflection from snow and ice. Here we show that the cornea and lens in Arctic reindeer do not block all UV and that the retina responds electrophysiologically to these wavelengths. Both rod and cone photoreceptors respond to UV at low-intensity stimulation. Retinal RNA extraction and in vitro opsin expression show that the response to UV is not mediated by a specific UV photoreceptor mechanism. Reindeer thus extend their visual range into the short wavelengths characteristic of the winter environment and periods of extended twilight present in spring and autumn. A specific advantage of this short-wavelength vision is the use of potential information caused by differential UV reflections known to occur in both Arctic vegetation and different types of snow. UV is normally highly damaging to the retina, resulting in photoreceptor degeneration. Because such damage appears not to occur in these animals, they may have evolved retinal mechanisms protecting against extreme UV exposure present in the daylight found in the snow-covered late winter environment.},

  abstract      = {In reindeer/caribou (Rangifer tarandus), the lens and cornea of the eye transmit ultraviolet (UV) light, and the retinae respond to it electrophysiologically. Here we tie this finding to the unusual visual environment experienced by these animals and propose that their sensitivity to UV light enhances vision at the low luminance characteristic of the polar winter. For such visual enhancement to occur, it is essential that functional components of the environment, such as forage plants, be visually salient under natural UV luminance. It is not self-evident, however, that this is the case. Although organic material generally absorbs UV radiation, powerful scattering of UV light by snow crystals potentially reduces contrast with the background. We therefore recorded UV images of vegetation in situ on snow-covered pasture under natural winter (March) luminance in northern Norway. For each vegetation scene, we made three monochrome digital images at 350&#x2013;390 nm (UV-Only), 400&#x2013;750 nm (No-UV), and 350&#x2013;750 nm (control), respectively. Plants at the snow surface appeared in high achromatic contrast against snow in UV-Only images. The contrast was substantially greater in the UV-Only images than in corresponding images in which UV was blocked. We conclude that plants are visually salient under natural UV luminance at wavelengths to which Rangifer are sensitive. This sensitivity is likely to improve the animals' ability to discriminate forage in snow, particularly at low but relatively UV-enriched twilight luminance. Le cristallin et la corn&#xe9;e de l'&#x153;il du caribou (aussi connu sous le nom de renne) (Rangifer tarandus) transmettent une lumi&#xe8;re ultraviolette (UV), &#xe0; laquelle la r&#xe9;tine envoie une r&#xe9;ponse &#xe9;lectrophysiologique. Ici, nous faisons le lien entre cette observation et l'environnement visuel inhabituel de ces animaux, puis nous proposons que leur sensibilit&#xe9; &#xe0; la lumi&#xe8;re UV enrichit leur vision dans la faible luminance de l'hiver polaire. Pour que cet enrichissement ait lieu, il est essentiel que les composantes fonctionnelles de l'environnement, comme les plantes fourrag&#xe8;res, soient visuellement saillantes sous la luminance UV naturelle. Il ne va cependant pas de soi que c'est le cas. Bien que la mati&#xe8;re organique absorbe g&#xe9;n&#xe9;ralement le rayonnement ultraviolet, la diffusion puissante de la lumi&#xe8;re UV d&#xe9;coulant de la pr&#xe9;sence des cristaux de neige peut avoir pour effet de r&#xe9;duire le contraste avec l'arri&#xe8;re-plan. Par cons&#xe9;quent, nous avons enregistr&#xe9; des images ultraviolettes de la v&#xe9;g&#xe9;tation in situ dans des p&#xe2;turages couverts de neige sous la luminance naturelle de l'hiver (en mars), dans le nord de la Norv&#xe8;ge. Pour chacune des sc&#xe8;nes de v&#xe9;g&#xe9;tation, nous avons fait trois images monochromes num&#xe9;riques, soit 350 &#xe0; 390 nm (UV seulement), 400 &#xe0; 750 nm (sans UV) et 350 &#xe0; 750 nm (contr&#xf4;l&#xe9;), respectivement. Les plantes &#xe0; la surface de la neige apparaissaient en fort contraste achromatique contre la neige dans le cas des images en UV seulement. Le contraste &#xe9;tait beaucoup plus grand dans les images en UV seulement que dans les images correspondantes pour lesquelles l'UV &#xe9;tait bloqu&#xe9;. Nous concluons que les plantes sont visuellement saillantes sous la luminance UV naturelle aux longueurs d'onde auxquelles le Rangifer est sensible. Cette sensibilit&#xe9; est susceptible d'am&#xe9;liorer l'aptitude de cet animal &#xe0; distinguer le fourrage dans la neige, particuli&#xe8;rement en situation de faible luminance relativement enrichie en UV, au cr&#xe9;puscule.},

  abstract      = {Large ungulate migrations occur across continents and inspire curiosity about how these animals know when to leave and where to go. Jesmer et al. took advantage of regional extinctions and reintroductions of several North American ungulate species to determine the role of learning in migrations (see the Perspective by Festa-Bianchet). Reintroduced populations of bighorn sheep and moose did not migrate as historical herds had. However, after several decades, newly established herds were better able to track the emergence of vegetation in the environment and were increasingly migratory. Thus, newly introduced animals learned about their environment and shared the information through social exchange.Science, this issue p. 1023; see also p. 972Ungulate migrations are assumed to stem from learning and cultural transmission of information regarding seasonal distribution of forage, but this hypothesis has not been tested empirically. We compared the migratory propensities of bighorn sheep and moose translocated into novel habitats with those of historical populations that had persisted for hundreds of years. Whereas individuals from historical populations were largely migratory, translocated individuals initially were not. After multiple decades, however, translocated populations gained knowledge about surfing green waves of forage (tracking plant phenology) and increased their propensity to migrate. Our findings indicate that learning and cultural transmission are the primary mechanisms by which ungulate migrations evolve. Loss of migration will therefore expunge generations of knowledge about the locations of high-quality forage and likely suppress population abundance.},

Overall, 227 members of the public and 60 police officers completed an online questionnaire involving an investigation into a child sex offence. Participants were asked to first (i) formulate their own “profile” of a likely offender then (ii) estimate the guilt of two presented suspect descriptions (orthodox vs. unorthodox), and, following the presentation of an “expert's” profile that matched either the orthodox or the unorthodox suspect, (iii) re-evaluate their guilt judgments of the two suspects based on this new advice. Finally, (iv) the perceived similarity (congruence) between the participants' own and the expert profile was assessed. Results revealed two key findings. First, expert profiles that matched a suspect's description elevated perceptions of guilt in that suspect, whilst also, simultaneously, very significantly decreasing the perception of guilt of the alternative suspect. This suggests a powerful rejection and downward revision of the other suspect. Second, perceived similarity of the profile (to one's own profile) was only a significant factor in increasing guilt judgments when assigning guilt to the unorthodox (as opposed to orthodox) suspect. Comparisons of lay judgments with those of police officers revealed few significant differences in effects. The finding that advice is most influential when unorthodox and incongruent suggests that decision makers are more likely to reevaluate judgments when expert advice contributes novel information that contradicts their beliefs. The practical implications of these findings are discussed for profilers, police, and decision research in general. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract      = { Migratory ungulates outnumber residents by an order of magnitude in several savanna ecosystems in Africa, as was apparently the case in other grasslands around the world before the intervention of modern man. Migrants may be more numerous than residents because (1) they use a much larger area, (2) they make more-efficient use of resources, or (3) they are less vulnerable to regulation by predators. These hypotheses were examined using simulation models of migratory and sedentary wildebeest in the Serengeti ecosystem. The larger area used by migrants would not lead inevitably to higher numbers. In seasonal environments, herbivore abundance is probably determined by food availability during periods of resource scarcity. Even though migrants may have access to greater food supplies for most of the year, this would not lead to increased abundance if both morphs have similar food supplies during the leanest period of the year. Rotational grazing could lead to increased numbers of migrants relative to residents only if migrants are able to use mature vegetation that has accumulated while they are foraging elsewhere. This is unlikely for savanna ecosystems in Africa because tropical grasses decline rapidly in quality as they mature. Moreover, our simulations suggest that in the Serengeti such a process would at most produce a twofold difference in abundances of migrants and residents. We conclude that increased efficiency in resource use by migrants is insufficient to explain the order-of-magnitude disparities in abundance seen in some African ecosystems. Our simulations suggest that realistic numbers of predators could regulate resident herbivores at low population densities, whereas such regulation is probably rare for migratory herds. When residents and migrants have overlapping ranges, migrants should always outcompete residents, reducing them to low numbers. These results suggest that differences in the modes of regulation explain the predominance of migratory herbivores in some grassland ecosystems. },

  abstract      = {Partially migratory populations comprise both resident and migratory individuals. These tactics may coexist if their demographic contribution to future generations (i.e. fitness) are equal or vary temporally with environmental conditions, or if individuals switch between being migrant and resident. Alternatively, the choice of movement tactic can be based on individual attributes such as age, competitive ability or personality. In the latter cases, the two tactics are not expected to have similar average fitness. In this study, we examined the effect of movement tactic on reproductive performance and survival of 82 GPS-marked female moose and their offspring in a partial migratory population in central Norway. The results indicated higher growth in the migrating part of the population because migrating females produced more twins than resident females. We found no differences in pregnancy rates or survival of adults or their offspring, indicating a net fitness benefit of being migrant. We found the average shoulder height of residents to be slightly lower than of migrants, but doubt that this affected their migration ability. A more likely explanation is that migratory females are both more fecund and grow bigger because of better conditions in their summer ranges. This may be a temporal phenomenon if the fitness differences between migratory and resident moose vary according to environmental fluctuations.},

  abstract      = {ABSTRACT: Knowledge of mammal migrations is low, and human impacts on migrations high. This jeopardizes efforts to conserve terrestrial migrations. To aid the conservation of these migrations, we synthesized information worldwide, describing 24 large-bodied ungulates that migrate in aggregations. This synthesis includes maps of extinct and extant migrations, numbers of migrants, summaries of ecological drivers and threats migrants confront. As data are often lacking, we outlined steps for science to address and inform conservation actions. We evaluated migrants against this framework, and reported their status. Mass migrations for 6 species are extinct or unknown. Most remaining migrants (n = 9) occur from 6 locations in Africa, with Eurasia and North America containing 6 and 4 remaining mass migrants, respectively (with caribou/reindeer <i>Rangifer tarandus</i> occurring in both regions). All migrants declined in abundance, except wildebeest and other migrants in the Serengeti-Mara Ecosystem (SME), white-eared kob and tiang in Sudan, and some caribou populations. Protected areas only contain migrations for 5 species in the SME, chiru on the Tibetan Plateau, and some caribou populations in North America. Most mass migrants track the seasonal and shifting patterns of greening vegetation over expanses of savannahs, steppes, and grasslands. Principal threats include overhunting and habitat loss from livestock, agriculture, and fencing that excludes animals from forage or water. Conservation science overlooks numerous migrations, so many have already disappeared and continue to do so. Key principles for conserving migrants, exemplified by the SME and Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE), include securing seasonal ranges, resource protection, government support and minimizing fences. This review forms a baseline for initiating conservation action for many ungulate migrations needing attention.},

  abstract      = {Abstract Migratory large herbivores in seasonal environments are known to follow the onset of new growth during spring, so-called green-wave surfing. This ensures prolonged access to forage with an optimal balance between forage quality and quantity. Many studies have focused on herbivores’ ability to follow the spring flush, but without considering potential constraints to surfing the green wave. The presence of predators is likely to be such a limitation, which could force herbivores to deviate from the optimal movement patterns in terms of forage access. We compared how well 319 reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) from seven different populations followed the green-up at different population densities of brown bear (Ursus arctos). We found that reindeer at higher bear densities selected movement paths with lower access to high-quality forage and deviated more in time from following the peak of the green wave, thus missing out on valuable forage. In addition, reindeer generally moved faster at higher bear densities, but this pattern was more consistent in forest habitats. Our results indicate that reindeer are forced to deviate from following the spring flush and alter their movement pattern in areas with high bear densities, which may lead to reduced body condition for reindeer experiencing high predation risk. With the recent recolonization of large carnivores in northern ecosystems, it is critical to understand the direct and indirect effects of predators on large herbivores in order to assess effects on population dynamics and potentially cascading consequences on ecosystem function.},

  abstract      = {The nutritional quality of forage plants varies in space and time. This variation is presumed to drive the annual migration of herbivore species which follow peaks in the availability of high quality forage between sites. The green-wave hypothesis predicts that during spring migration to northern breeding sites, geese and other herbivorous waterfowl travel along a climatic gradient, taking advantage of the flush of spring growth of forage plants at each stopover site along the gradient. Here, we explore a basic assumption of the green wave hypothesis which states that there are successive waves of forage availability along the East-Atlantic Flyway from temperate to arctic sites, as spring advances. We use one of the migration routes of the Barnacle Goose Branta leucopsis as a model to compare data on food quality and quantity of forage plants with the timing of migration along its migratory corridor. We collected data on forage biomass and quality at three saltmarsh sites along the traditional migration route of the Barnacle Goose: a temperate staging site in the Wadden Sea, a Baltic stopover site and a Russian sub-arctic breeding site. In all areas forage biomass increased in spring, while the nutritional quality peaked early in the season and declined with increasing biomass. We combined data on forage biomass and nutritional quality in one measure, the nutrient biomass. For all sites, nutrient biomass showed a peak in early spring. We used observations on goose migration to examine whether the geese utilise these peaks in nutrient biomass, as is predicted by the green wave hypothesis. Our data show that the geese utilise the Wadden Sea staging site and the Baltic stopover site at the moments of peak nutrient biomass. At the Russian breeding site, geese arrive prior to the flush of spring growth of forage plants and profit from the peak in nutrient biomass when the goslings hatch and adult birds start moulting. We conclude that spring nutrient biomass is a key factor driving the timing of the annual northern migration of avian herbivores.

These students have been labelled digital natives and have been ascribed the ability to cognitively process multiple sources of information simultaneously (i.e., they can multitask). As a result of this thinking, they are seen by teachers, educational administrators, politicians/policy makers, and the media to require an educational approach radically different from that of previous generations. This article presents scientific evidence showing that there is no such thing as a digital native who is information-skilled simply because (s)he has never known a world that was not digital. It then proceeds to present evidence that one of the alleged abilities of students in this generation, the ability to multitask, does not exist and that designing education that assumes the presence of this ability hinders rather than helps learning. The article concludes by elaborating on possible implications of this for education/educational policy.},

  abstract      = {I denna avhandling analyseras resultaten från två utvärderingsprojekt av 1:1-införande som genomförts på två högstadieskolor (2007-2011) och fyra gymnasieskolor (2012-2014) i Sverige. Data från enkäter, intervjuer och observationer har analyserats för att svara på frågeställningar om hur olika aspekter av den pågående digitaliseringen påverkar verksamheten i skolan. Den teoretiska utgångspunkten tas i ett sociokulturellt perspektiv på skola som verksamhet, på teknologi som medierande redskap och på utveckling och lärande som socialt grundade. För att beskriva komplexiteten i läraruppdraget används det teoretiska ramverket TPACK. Ramverket beskriver integrationen mellan de teknologiska, pedagogiska och innehållsliga kunskapsdomäner som tillsammans bildar kärnan i en lärares kompetens i en digitaliserad skola. Resultaten visar att det krävs kunskap om och förståelse för praktikens förutsättningar för att kunna avgöra huruvida digitalisering och 1:1-satsningar påverkar. Ur ett makroperspektiv förefaller klassrumsaktiviteterna vara i stort sett opåverkade av 1:1-införandet. Undervisningen tycks pågå som tidigare och förefaller i huvudsak traditionell och kontrollerad av en reglerande diskurs. Å andra sidan, när skolan studeras ur ett mesoperspektiv är det möjligt att urskilja ett antal väsentliga förändringar av verksamheten. Teknologin påverkar verksamheten, men det innebär inte automatiskt en förändring av den övergripande strukturen för hur utbildningen praktiseras. Ett 1:1-införande leder först till förändringar på praktiknivå med utmaningar av lärares och elevers verksamhet. Delstudierna i avhandlingen visar att digitaliseringen påverkar lärares lektionsplanering, och att elevers användning av de digitala redskapen förändras över tid. Dessutom diskuteras lärares argument för att inte integrera digitala verktyg i den pedagogiska praktiken.Avhandlingen har konsekvenser för praktikfältet genom att den identifierar och diskuterar några av följderna av digitaliseringen av skolan. De klassrumsnära studierna visar att IT-användningen är varierande och ojämn, och att införandet av 1:1 är en komplicerad process som utmanar verksamheten i skolan på flera nivåer.},

One of the reasons suggested for this decline is that teachers and students have different frames of reference, whereby teachers sometimes communicate science in the classroom in a way that is not accessible to the students. There is a lack of research investigating the effects of coteaching with senior students in science in upper secondary schools. To improve teaching and to narrow the gap between teachers’ and students’ different frames of references, this study investigates how an experienced chemistry teacher gains and refines her pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) by cooperating with two grade 12 students (age 18) as coteachers. The teacher and the two coteachers coplanned, cotaught and coevaluated lessons in chemical bonding in a grade 10 upper secondary class. Findings indicate that the coteachers contributed with their own learning experiences to help the teacher understand how students perceive difficult concepts. In such way, the coteachers were mediating between the teacher and the students, thus bridging the gap between the teacher and the students’ frames of references. The teachers’ PCK was refined which in turn lead to improved teaching strategies. },

The first legend is one of learners as digital natives who form a generation of students knowing by nature how to learn from new media, and for whom “old” media and methods used in teaching/learning no longer work. The second legend is the widespread belief that learners have specific learning styles and that education should be individualized to the extent that the pedagogy of teaching/learning is matched to the preferred style of the learner. The final legend is that learners ought to be seen as self-educators who should be given maximum control over what they are learning and their learning trajectory. It concludes with a possible reason why these legends have taken hold, are so pervasive, and are so difficult to eradicate. },

Although such research has validity limitations for humans, reductionist methodology enables a more controlled exploration of music's elementary effects. This article also explores candidate mechanisms for this putative effect. A review of neurobiological evidence from human and comparative animal studies confirms that musical stimuli modify autonomic and neurochemical arousal indices, and may also modify synaptic plasticity. It is proposed that understanding how music affects animals provides a valuable conjunct to human research and may be vital in uncovering how music might be used to enhance cognitive performance. },

Abstract
Background: Exhaustion and burnout are common causes for sickness absence. This study examines the relationship
between psychological demands and burnout over time, and if environmental support modifies the longitudinal
relationship between psychological demands and burnout at baseline, with burnout measured 2 years subsequently.
Methods: A questionnaire was sent to employees in seven Swedish organizations in 2010–2012 with follow-up after 2
years, n = 1722 responded (64%). Linear regressions were used to examine the associations between burnout and
psychological demands at baseline and burnout at follow-up. Stratified regression models examined if relationships
between burnout and psychological demands at baseline on burnout at follow-up differed for employees in
supportive versus unsupportive work environments.
Results: Burnout and psychological demands at baseline were associated with burnout at follow-up, after adjustment
for study covariates. No significant differences were observed between estimates for psychological demands and
burnout among respondents in supportive work environments versus those in unsupportive work environments.
Conclusions: This study shows that high demands are associated with greater risk of burnout, regardless of level of
other work supports. This has implications for prevention of sick leave due to burnout and for rehabilitation, where
demands such as work pace, workload and conflicting demands at work may need to be reduced.

Fossils of Dickinsonia, bilaterally symmetrical oval organisms, have been particularly difficult to classify. Bobrovskiy et al. conducted an analysis using lipid biomarkers obtained from Dickinsonia fossils and found that the fossils contained almost exclusively cholesteroids, a marker found only in animals (see the Perspective by Summons and Erwin). Thus, Dickinsonia were basal animals. This supports the idea that the Ediacaran biota may have been a precursor to the explosion of animal forms later observed in the Cambrian, about 500 million years ago.Science, this issue p. 1246; see also p. 1198The enigmatic Ediacara biota (571 million to 541 million years ago) represents the first macroscopic complex organisms in the geological record and may hold the key to our understanding of the origin of animals. Ediacaran macrofossils are as {\textquotedblleft}strange as life on another planet{\textquotedblright} and have evaded taxonomic classification, with interpretations ranging from marine animals or giant single-celled protists to terrestrial lichens. Here, we show that lipid biomarkers extracted from organically preserved Ediacaran macrofossils unambiguously clarify their phylogeny. Dickinsonia and its relatives solely produced cholesteroids, a hallmark of animals. Our results make these iconic members of the Ediacara biota the oldest confirmed macroscopic animals in the rock record, indicating that the appearance of the Ediacara biota was indeed a prelude to the Cambrian explosion of animal life.},

  abstract      = {Despite increased funding, expansion of different educational levels and many reforms, most education systems around
the world have not yet found effective ways to improve outcomes to prepare students for our volatile and uncertain world
and its increasing demands for higher non-routine skills. As the Red Queen says to Alice in Through the Looking-Glass
(Lewis Carroll): “Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get
somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!” This might well be a metaphor for our rapidly changing
environment, where education systems need to adapt continuously to keep up with the rapid pace at which technological
change and the digital revolution are affecting the way we work, live and relate to one another. Keeping up requires
improving the performance of all students, overcoming the factors that may hinder their outcomes, and equipping them
with new sets of skills.
The education systems that have succeeded in improving student outcomes in our rapidly evolving landscape point
the way forward: teachers must be the top priority. Teachers need new solutions to today’s unprecedented demands
and challenges. They have to be able to prepare students to face technologically-driven change, to work in different
jobs and fields or create their own work environment, to distinguish the quality of sources of information, to become
critical thinkers, to adapt to change, to relate to people with different cultural background and beliefs, to persevere when
confronted with adversity and to learn throughout their lives.
The adaptability of education systems and their ability to evolve ultimately depends on enabling teachers to transform
what and how students learn. Teachers have a positive impact on their students’ outcomes when they engage in direct
instruction and are able to adapt it to the different needs of their diverse classrooms. A positive disciplinary climate is
also essential for teachers to be able to improve student performance and have a sense of well-being and self-efficacy.
To strengthen support for teachers, pre-service training offered by education institutions needs to meet high standards,
selection procedures need to be sufficiently demanding, and in-service teacher training needs to move from courses
and workshops with little impact to new forms of professional development that integrate mentoring by highly skilled
teachers, new forms of professional collaboration between teachers and lifelong learning.
To achieve high quality, education systems need to perform well in two dimensions: excellence and equity. Many highperforming
systems do well on both, demonstrating that excellence and equity are not mutually exclusive. However, to
achieve equity, specific measures need to be put in place to overcome factors known to hinder student performance.

The negative impact of socio-economic background is present in all systems to different degrees. Thus, while socioeconomic
background is always a strong predictor of performance, good-quality systems raise the performance of all
students so that disadvantaged students in good-quality systems outperform advantaged students in poor-quality systems.
In addition, the magnitude of the gap between advantaged and disadvantaged students varies considerably. Policies
known to minimise the impact of socio-economic background include providing good-quality early childhood education
and care, allocating additional resources to disadvantaged schools, identifying struggling students as early as possible
to provide compensatory measures, and also identifying students at risk of dropping out and offering them support and
alternative pathways through vocational education and training.

Gender differences in performance vary depending on the field of study. Science is particularly revealing, because
differences in performance are small. But there are major differences between boys and girls in their perceptions of their
abilities and their career expectations, mainly due to prejudices from parents and teachers, which need to be addressed.
Immigrant students also tend to underperform compared to non-migrants. However, for many immigrant students,
performance is high by international standards. New evidence shows that their performance is related to both the country
of origin and the host country. Thus, host countries need to find ways to overcome language barriers and nurture the
talents of students with different cultural backgrounds.
Over the last few decades, many countries have decentralised their education systems to grant greater autonomy to regions,
local authorities or schools. The underlying premise is that individual schools have highly qualified teachers and strong
leaders who are good judges of their students’ learning needs, and who can (re)design and implement rigorous curricula,
internal evaluations and accountability mechanisms. However, more school autonomy may not always be effective.
The benefits of school autonomy may be contingent on how prepared schools are to use their responsibility effectively and
how accountable they are for their students’ outcomes to parents, local communities and education authorities. Thus, it is
crucial to build capacity as responsibilities are transferred from the central government to other levels of governance.
The complexity of decentralised systems is such that many decisions taken at the systemic level also have a great impact
on teaching and learning. Such system-level decisions include:

 The way responsibilities for education are distributed and managed among different actors and how they are held
accountable for them.
• The overall structure of the education system.
• What mechanisms are put in place to ensure that high curricular standards are guaranteed for all students.
• What evaluations and assessments are put in place to identify and support struggling students and to signal the targets
that all students need to achieve at the end of different educational stages.
• How decisions are made about which teachers are assigned to which schools.
• Who defines the standards for the teaching profession.
• Who is responsible for decisions about budgets, teacher salaries, careers and incentives.
• At what level teacher training and professional development are defined, developed and funded.
The increase in the number of stakeholders also creates the need for greater collaboration in the design and implementation
of reforms. Since different stakeholders have different interests, conflicts may arise. It is crucial that the dialogue and
debate be evidence-based, using system data to make an accurate diagnosis of the situation, international comparisons
to define how the level of performance compares to other countries, and a profound knowledge of good practices in
other systems to understand what works and what does not work in different contexts.
Far too many education reforms fail during the implementation phase. This is due to a very complex combination of
factors, including the disconnect between short political cycles and the need to implement education reforms gradually,
the contrast between short-term costs and long-term benefit, insufficient efforts to build capacity across all levels and all
the way to the classroom, and little understanding of some reforms by the main actors (teachers).
It is important for governments and unions to recognise the intrinsic difficulties associated with education reforms and
to agree that the ultimate and shared goal is to prepare students to succeed in life},

In this study, we explored this assumption by assessing the prevalence of neuromyth acceptance amongst a group of internationally recognized, award-winning teachers and comparing this to previously published data with trainee and non-award winning teacher populations.  Results revealed the acceptance of neuromyths to be nearly identical between these two groups, with the only difference occurring on 2 (out of 15) items.  These findings suggest that one can not make simple, unqualified arguments concerning the relationship between belief in neuromyths and teacher effectiveness.

Enhanced C29 sterol abundances provide algal cell membranes a density advantage in large temperature fluctuations. Here, we combined a literature review with new analyses to generate a comprehensive inventory of unambiguously syngenetic steranes in Neoproterozoic rocks. Our results show that the capacity for C29 24-ethyl-sterol biosynthesis emerged in the Cryogenian, that is, between 720 and 635 million years ago during the Neoproterozoic Snowball Earth glaciations, which were an evolutionary stimulant, not a bottleneck. This biochemical innovation heralded the rise of green algae to global dominance of marine ecosystems and highlights the environmental drivers for the evolution of sterol biosynthesis. The Cryogenian emergence of C29 sterol biosynthesis places a benchmark for verifying older sterane signatures and sets a new framework for our understanding of early algal evolution.},

  abstract      = {The dispersal of the freshwater hydrozoan Craspeda-
custa sowerbyi Lankester, 1880, from its presumed
original distribution in China to many parts of the
temperate and subtropical world has been described
in a number of papers (e.g. R EISINGER 1972, R AYNER
1988, D UMONT 1994, M C A LPINE et al. 2002). Two
main hypotheses, alone or in combination, have been
proposed to explain its success: first, the dispersal
may be supported by human activities; and second,
higher temperatures due to climate change may open
new areas for invasions. No hard data exist to support
any of these hypotheses, but it seems relevant that
dispersing vectors are involved in the fast inter-
continental range expansion, and low temperatures
have, in fact, been shown to be harmful for some of
the life stages (see review by A CKER & M USCAT
1976).
The main life form of Craspedacusta is the polyp,
which reproduces asexually by budding off new
polyps, frustula larvae that disperse locally, or active-
ly swimming medusae (Fig.1). Harsh conditions can
be survived in a special resting stage, the podocyst,
which is also supposed to be the main dispersal body
over long distances. The polyps are small and seldom
noticed in nature, while the medusae, ranging in size
from about 1 to > 25 mm, may be detected in plank-
ton samples or directly by the human eye in nature
when they aggregate near the water surface or during
SCUBA diving. The medusa stages are either males
or females, and they reproduce only sexually. Planu-
la larvae develop from the fertilized eggs and later
metamorphose into new polyps.
A characteristic trait of invading Craspedacusta
populations is unisexuality. Outside China very few
observations have been made of populations with
medusae of both sexes (R ICE 1958, D EACON &
H ASKELL 1967). This is most likely a founder effect:
the sex is determined genetically, and a polyp, as well
as all its asexual descendants, can produce medusae
of one sex only.
Negative effects of Craspedacusta invasions into
lakes are seldom reported. The ecology of the polyps
is not much studied, but medusae have been proposed
to influence the pelagial ecosystem by top-down ef-
fects and by competition with fish fry. Craspedacus-
ta feeds on a variety of zooplankton, but common
crustaceans such as Bosmina, Ceriodaphnia, Eudiap-
tomus and Mesocyclops seem to be frequently ingest-
ed, as are some species of unloricated rotifers
(S PADINGER & M AIER 1999, B OOTHROYD et al. 2002).
Medusae densities are usually too low to affect food
webs (D ODSON & C OOPER 1983), but during condi-
tions with very high densities the structure of the
zooplankton community may be affected (J ANKOWSKI
& R ATTE 2001).
Thus, Craspedacusta invasions usually do not
seem to be significantly harmful, but the distribution
pattern of the species outside its original range may
help identify regions where freshwater ecosystem
biodiversity is affected by human-mediated invasions
and by global warming. We here report on all the
known occurrences of Craspedacusta sowerbyi in
Sweden with focus on the many new observations
made in 2002.

What's new is the extent to which changes in the economy and the world mean that collective and individual success depends on having such skills. The authors argue that if these skills were indeed new, then Americans would need a radical overhaul of how they think about content and curriculum. Developing students' skills requires a content-rich curriculum, well-supported teachers, and sophisticated assessments. The authors seek to call attention to the magnitude of the challenge and to sound a note of caution amidst the sirens calling the political leaders once again to the rocky shoals of past education reform failures. Without better curriculum, better teaching, and better tests, the emphasis on "21st-century skills" will be a superficial one that will sacrifice long-term gains for the appearance of short-term progress.

  abstract      = {Increased mortality of honey bee colonies has been attributed to several factors but is not fully understood. The herbicide glyphosate is expected to be innocuous to animals, including bees, because it targets an enzyme only found in plants and microorganisms. However, bees rely on a specialized gut microbiota that benefits growth and provides defense against pathogens. Most bee gut bacteria contain the enzyme targeted by glyphosate, but vary in whether they possess susceptible versions and, correspondingly, in tolerance to glyphosate. Exposing bees to glyphosate alters the bee gut community and increases susceptibility to infection by opportunistic pathogens. Understanding how glyphosate impacts bee gut symbionts and bee health will help elucidate a possible role of this chemical in colony decline.Glyphosate, the primary herbicide used globally for weed control, targets the 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) enzyme in the shikimate pathway found in plants and some microorganisms. Thus, glyphosate may affect bacterial symbionts of animals living near agricultural sites, including pollinators such as bees. The honey bee gut microbiota is dominated by eight bacterial species that promote weight gain and reduce pathogen susceptibility. The gene encoding EPSPS is present in almost all sequenced genomes of bee gut bacteria, indicating that they are potentially susceptible to glyphosate. We demonstrated that the relative and absolute abundances of dominant gut microbiota species are decreased in bees exposed to glyphosate at concentrations documented in the environment. Glyphosate exposure of young workers increased mortality of bees subsequently exposed to the opportunistic pathogen Serratia marcescens. Members of the bee gut microbiota varied in susceptibility to glyphosate, largely corresponding to whether they possessed an EPSPS of class I (sensitive to glyphosate) or class II (insensitive to glyphosate). This basis for differences in sensitivity was confirmed using in vitro experiments in which the EPSPS gene from bee gut bacteria was cloned into Escherichia coli. All strains of the core bee gut species, Snodgrassella alvi, encode a sensitive class I EPSPS, and reduction in S. alvi levels was a consistent experimental result. However, some S. alvi strains appear to possess an alternative mechanism of glyphosate resistance. Thus, exposure of bees to glyphosate can perturb their beneficial gut microbiota, potentially affecting bee health and their effectiveness as pollinators.},

Persistent organic compounds, like PCBs, magnify across trophic levels, and thus apex predators are particularly susceptible to their ill effects. Desforges et al. looked at the continuing impact of PCBs on one of the largest marine predators, the killer whale. Using globally available data, the authors found high concentrations of PCBs within killer whale tissues. These are likely to precipitate declines across killer whale populations, particularly those that feed at high trophic levels and are the closest to industrialized areas.Science, this issue p. 1373Killer whales (Orcinus orca) are among the most highly polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB){\textendash}contaminated mammals in the world, raising concern about the health consequences of current PCB exposures.

They are a potential explanation for many striking patterns seen in the fossil record and molecular phylogenies. One such bias is the “push of the past”: clades that survived a substantial length of time are likely to have experienced a high rate of early diversification. This creates the illusion of a secular rate slow-down through time that is, rather, a reversion to the mean. An extra effect increasing early rates of lineage generation is also seen in large clades. These biases are important but relatively neglected influences on many aspects of diversification patterns in the fossil record and elsewhere, such as diversification spikes after mass extinctions and at the origins of clades; they also influence rates of fossilization, changes in rates of phenotypic evolution and even molecular clocks. These inevitable features of surviving and/or large clades should thus not be generalized to the diversification process as a whole without additional study of small and extinct clades, and raise questions about many of the traditional explanations of the patterns seen in the fossil record.},

  abstract      = {Neandertal manual activities, as previously reconstructed from their robust hand skeletons, are thought to involve systematic power grasping rather than precise hand movements. However, this interpretation is at odds with increasing archeological evidence for sophisticated cultural behavior. We reevaluate the manipulative behaviors of Neandertals and early modern humans using a historical reference sample with extensive genealogical and lifelong occupational documentation, in combination with a new and precise three-dimensional multivariate analysis of hand muscle attachments. Results show that Neandertal muscle marking patterns overlap exclusively with documented lifelong precision workers, reflecting systematic precision grasping consistent with the use of their associated cultural remains. Our findings challenge the established interpretation of Neandertal behavior and establish a solid link between biological and cultural remains in the fossil record.},

  abstract      = {A female advantage in school marks is a common finding in education research, and it extends to most course subjects (e.g., language, math, science), unlike what is found on achievement tests. However, questions remain concerning the quantification of these gender differences and the identification of relevant moderator variables. The present meta-analysis answered these questions by examining studies that included an evaluation of gender differences in teacher-assigned school marks in elementary, junior/middle, or high school or at the university level (both undergraduate and graduate). The final analysis was based on 502 effect sizes drawn from 369 samples. A multilevel approach to meta-analysis was used to handle the presence of nonindependent effect sizes in the overall sample. This method was complemented with an examination of results in separate subject matters with a mixed-effects meta-analytic model. A small but significant female advantage (mean d = 0.225, 95% CI [0.201, 0.249]) was demonstrated for the overall sample of effect sizes. Noteworthy findings were that the female advantage was largest for language courses (mean d = 0.374, 95% CI [0.316, 0.432]) and smallest for math courses (mean d = 0.069, 95% CI [0.014, 0.124]). Source of marks, nationality, racial composition of samples, and gender composition of samples were significant moderators of effect sizes. Finally, results showed that the magnitude of the female advantage was not affected by year of publication, thereby contradicting claims of a recent “boy crisis” in school achievement. The present meta-analysis demonstrated the presence of a stable female advantage in school marks while also identifying critical moderators. Implications for future educational and psychological research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

The effects, measured 11 and 50 years after the initial assessment, differed significantly across the two indicators of school selectivity that were used. School average socioeconomic background was positively related to students’ educational expectations, educational attainment, income, and occupational prestige at the 11-year follow-up (0.15 ≤ β ≤ 0.39; all ps < .001). Conversely, schools’ average achievement at the 11-year follow-up was negatively related to students’ expectations, attainment, income, and occupational prestige (−0.42 ≤ β ≤ −0.05; all ps < .05) when schools’ socioeconomic background was controlled for. All associations were mediated by students’ educational expectations. With the exception of income, these effects were consistent 50 years after high school, pointing to the long reach of beneficial learning resources and negative social comparison processes when attending selective schools.},

  abstract      = {SUMMARY
 In the first international PISA league tables, published by the
OECD in 2001, Finland achieved top positions in mathematical,
reading, and scientific literacy. Since then, policymakers from
around the world have tried to learn from its extraordinary and
unexpected success. However, Finnish scores in all domains
slipped in PISA 2009, and to an even greater degree in PISA
2012.
 Why did Finland achieve such success in PISA? The standard
policy explanations for the country’s rise include its focus on
equity, with the comprehensive school reform of the 1970s as
the bedrock, and the absence of standardised tests,
accountability, and market reforms. Other explanations
highlight comparatively little school- and homework, and the
country’s current teacher education system.
 Yet there is little hard evidence for any of the standard
explanations – in fact, most research explicitly does not
support them.
ii Furthermore, a closer examination of Finland’s results over
time reveals that its rise began well before most of the
highlighted policies were able to take effect. For example, the
lack of accountability and the high level of autonomy for
schools and teachers are recent phenomena. Up until the
1990s, the Finnish education system was centralised and had
little autonomy.
 Finland’s complicated and unique history appears to be an
important explanation for its educational success, not least via
the high social status and quality of teachers. This dates back
to their distinctive role in the nation-building process,
beginning in the 19 th century, and is therefore unlikely to be
caused by current policies.
 Finland was also a comparatively “late developer” in terms of
industrialisation, economic growth, rollout of mass education,
and development of a welfare state. As a result, Finnish culture
for long remained more traditional than in other Nordic
countries, reflecting its similarities with high-performing East
Asian nations. This is likely to have underpinned the country’s
improvements in international tests via a “wealth effect”, which
first increases and later decreases educational performance
as a function of income.
 In education, the special socio-economic and cultural
trajectory meant that a hierarchical and traditional schooling
climate remained largely in place until relatively recently.
Perhaps most conspicuous, pupil-led teaching methods were
for
long
absent
admonishments
from
from
the
Finnish
classrooms,
educational
despite
establishment.
Incidentally, an increasing body of research suggests that
traditional methods are superior for raising pupil achievement.
iii The recent fall in performance may in part be explained by the
fact that many of the above preconditions for success are now
being eroded. The country’s culture is catching up with the
radical economic transformation that took place in the second
half of the 20 th century. In particular, the traditional and
teacher-centred educational culture is being replaced by
more pupil-led ways of working.
 While a degree of caution in seeking lessons from Finland’s
success is always necessary, the in-depth analysis in this
monograph shows that existing popular explanations for the
country’s achievements, such as its lack of market reforms and
accountability, do not withstand scrutiny. Instead, it suggests
that the country’s rise was to a large extent shaped by socio-
economic and historical factors, as well as the retention of a
traditional educational culture.},

Thai is, managers and professionals devote a relatively small fraction of their work time to management- and professional-level work, and a relatively large fraction of their time to support and nonproductive tasks. In addition, the study found significant staffing imbalances throughout the cases: In nearly every office, there were more managers and professionals, and fewer support workers, than were required to perform the work cost-effectively. An analysis of this situation suggests that a typical organization could reduce its annual office payroll costs by over 15 percent by calibrating its staffing mix and increasing the intellectual specialization of its office workers. Further, the apparent failure of massive corporate investments in office technology to achieve commensurate increases in white-collar productivity is likely due, in large measure, to reductions in the intellectual specialization of office workers resulting from myopic staffing decisions. The article concludes with advice on measuring and tracking office productivity, developing a coherent office productivity strategy, and making office staffing and technology decisions.},

Repeated testing enhances learning more than repeated reading, which often confers limited benefit beyond that gained from the initial reading of the material. Laboratory research also suggests that students lack metacognitive awareness of the mnemonic benefits of testing. The implication is that in real-world educational settings students may not engage in retrieval practise to enhance learning. To investigate students’ real-world study behaviours, we surveyed 177 college students and asked them (1) to list strategies they used when studying (an open-ended free report question) and (2) to choose whether they would reread or practise recall after studying a textbook chapter (a forced report question). The results of both questions point to the same conclusion: A majority of students repeatedly read their notes or textbook (despite the limited benefits of this strategy), but relatively few engage in self-testing or retrieval practise while studying. We propose that many students experience illusions of competence while studying and that these illusions have significant consequences for the strategies students select when they monitor and regulate their own learning. },

Results are discussed in terms of students’ self‐reported use of underlining. },

Time restricted feeding decreases energy intake without calorie counting and may be a viable option for weight loss. However, the effect of this diet on body weight in obese subjects has never been examined.

OBJECTIVE:
This study investigated the effects of 8-h time restricted feeding on body weight and metabolic disease risk factors in obese adults.

DESIGN:
Obese subjects (n = 23) participated in an 8-h time restricted feeding intervention (ad libitum feeding between 10:00 to 18:00 h, water fasting between 18:00 to 10:00 h) for 12 weeks. Weight loss and other outcomes were compared to a matched historical control group (n = 23).

RESULTS:
Body weight and energy intake decreased in the time restricted group (–2.6% ± 0.5; –341 ± 53 kcal/d) relative to controls over 12 weeks (P < 0.05). Systolic blood pressure decreased in the time restricted feeding group (–7 ± 2 mm Hg) versus controls (P < 0.05). Fat mass, lean mass, visceral fat mass, diastolic blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, and homocysteine were not significantly different from controls after 12 weeks (no group×time interaction).

CONCLUSION:
These findings suggest that 8-h time restricted feeding produces mild caloric restriction and weight loss, without calorie counting. It may also offer clinical benefits by reducing blood pressure.},

IMPORTANCE:
Alternate-day fasting has become increasingly popular, yet, to date, no long-term randomized clinical trials have evaluated its efficacy.

OBJECTIVE:
To compare the effects of alternate-day fasting vs daily calorie restriction on weight loss, weight maintenance, and risk indicators for cardiovascular disease.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:
A single-center randomized clinical trial of obese adults (18 to 64 years of age; mean body mass index, 34) was conducted between October 1, 2011, and January 15, 2015, at an academic institution in Chicago, Illinois.

INTERVENTIONS:
Participants were randomized to 1 of 3 groups for 1 year: alternate-day fasting (25% of energy needs on fast days; 125% of energy needs on alternating "feast days"), calorie restriction (75% of energy needs every day), or a no-intervention control. The trial involved a 6-month weight-loss phase followed by a 6-month weight-maintenance phase.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES:
The primary outcome was change in body weight. Secondary outcomes were adherence to the dietary intervention and risk indicators for cardiovascular disease.

RESULTS:
Among the 100 participants (86 women and 14 men; mean [SD] age, 44 [11] years), the dropout rate was highest in the alternate-day fasting group (13 of 34 [38%]), vs the daily calorie restriction group (10 of 35 [29%]) and control group (8 of 31 [26%]). Mean weight loss was similar for participants in the alternate-day fasting group and those in the daily calorie restriction group at month 6 (-6.8% [95% CI, -9.1% to -4.5%] vs -6.8% [95% CI, -9.1% to -4.6%]) and month 12 (-6.0% [95% CI, -8.5% to -3.6%] vs -5.3% [95% CI, -7.6% to -3.0%]) relative to those in the control group. Participants in the alternate-day fasting group ate more than prescribed on fast days, and less than prescribed on feast days, while those in the daily calorie restriction group generally met their prescribed energy goals. There were no significant differences between the intervention groups in blood pressure, heart rate, triglycerides, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, insulin resistance, C-reactive protein, or homocysteine concentrations at month 6 or 12. Mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels at month 6 significantly increased among the participants in the alternate-day fasting group (6.2 mg/dL [95% CI, 0.1-12.4 mg/dL]), but not at month 12 (1.0 mg/dL [95% CI, -5.9 to 7.8 mg/dL]), relative to those in the daily calorie restriction group. Mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly elevated by month 12 among the participants in the alternate-day fasting group (11.5 mg/dL [95% CI, 1.9-21.1 mg/dL]) compared with those in the daily calorie restriction group.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:
Alternate-day fasting did not produce superior adherence, weight loss, weight maintenance, or cardioprotection vs daily calorie restriction.

  abstract      = {Sterane biomarkers preserved in ancient sedimentary rocks hold promise for tracking the diversification and ecological expansion of eukaryotes. The earliest proposed animal biomarkers from demosponges (Demospongiae) are recorded in a sequence around 100 Myr long of Neoproterozoic-Cambrian marine sedimentary strata from the Huqf Supergroup, South Oman Salt Basin. This C30 sterane biomarker, informally known as 24-isopropylcholestane (24-ipc), possesses the same carbon skeleton as sterols found in some modern-day demosponges. However, this evidence is controversial because 24-ipc is not exclusive to demosponges since 24-ipc sterols are found in trace amounts in some pelagophyte algae. Here, we report a new fossil sterane biomarker that co-occurs with 24-ipc in a suite of late Neoproterozoic-Cambrian sedimentary rocks and oils, which possesses a rare hydrocarbon skeleton that is uniquely found within extant demosponge taxa. This sterane is informally designated as 26-methylstigmastane (26-mes), reflecting the very unusual methylation at the terminus of the steroid side chain. It is the first animal-specific sterane marker detected in the geological record that can be unambiguously linked to precursor sterols only reported from extant demosponges. These new findings strongly suggest that demosponges, and hence multicellular animals, were prominent in some late Neoproterozoic marine environments at least extending back to the Cryogenian period.},

While the anti-inflammatory and hypotriglyceridemic properties of long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) are well known, their antiobesity effects and efficacy against metabolic syndrome, especially in humans, are still under debate. In animal models, evidence consistently suggests a role for n-3 PUFAs in reducing fat mass, particularly in the retroperitoneal and epididymal regions. In humans, however, published research suggests that though n-3 PUFAs may not aid weight loss, they may attenuate further weight gain and could be useful in the diet or as a supplement to help maintain weight loss. Proposed mechanisms by which n-3 PUFAs may work to improve body composition and counteract obesity-related metabolic changes include modulating lipid metabolism; regulating adipokines, such as adiponectin and leptin; alleviating adipose tissue inflammation; promoting adipogenesis and altering epigenetic mechanisms.},

  abstract      = {Summary
Background
There remains common belief in the general community that weight cycling or ‘yo-yo dieting’ is associated with potential adverse effects on obesity and metabolic risk factors. In 1994, a review by the National Task Force on the Prevention and Treatment of Obesity concluded that weight cycling did not impact metabolism, and that weight loss attempts should not be discouraged. This study is an updated review of the literature published since 1994, to determine if weight cycling is associated with metabolic risk factors for obesity and type 2 diabetes.
Methods
A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, ISI Web of Science and SCOPUS to identify primary studies that examined weight cycling in relation to obesity and metabolic risk factors. Thirty-one studies with human subjects were retained.
Results
Fifty-eight percent (11/19) of publications reported that a history of weight cycling was correlated with increased body fat and central adiposity. Another fifty percent (4/8) of studies reported that the presence of weight cycling increased the likelihood of future weight gain, suggesting that weight cycling is potentially problematic for individuals attempting to lose weight. The majority of studies (13/17; 76%) did not show a detrimental effect of weight cycling on risk of type 2 diabetes.
Conclusions
There is some evidence showing that weight cycling has no effect on risk of type 2 diabetes and inconclusive evidence that a history or presence of weight cycling influences body composition, or predisposes to future obesity. The available evidence so far suggests that there is little detrimental effect of weight cycling on current and future obesity and metabolic risk, and therefore weight loss efforts in individuals with overweight/obesity should continue to be encouraged.},

Background
The objective of the study was to evaluate indirect methods commonly used in the field to decontaminate water as follows: boiling for 5–10 minutes and heating until “too hot to touch.” Water perceived to be “too hot to touch” is defined as water in which a subject is unable to bear having the right index finger fully immersed for 5 seconds.

Methods
Five flasks of water at 25°C, 50°C, 60°C, 70°C, and 100°C were inoculated with 1.82 × 106Escherichia coli bacteria. At the time of inoculation, and at 1 minute, 5 minutes, and 10 minutes, samples were withdrawn from each flask. The samples were plated and incubated for 18 to 24 hours. The numbers of colonies were then counted. Finally, subjects attempted to immerse, fully, their right index fingers into water at 50°C, 55°C, 60°C, and 65°C for 5 seconds. Subjects were normal, healthy individuals who worked at a microbiology laboratory. The main outcome measures were the number of colonies and the subjects' intolerance to heat.

Results
Results showed that water at 50°C has no effect on the number of bacteria, whereas water maintained at 60°C for 5 minutes and at 70°C and 100°C for any time period effectively kills E. coli bacteria. The majority of subjects found 60°C or cooler to be “too hot to touch.”

Conclusions
For travelers or campers, water is safe to drink if heated to boiling, but heating water until it is “too hot to touch” is inadequate for safe drinking purposes.

We focused on three instructional practices that have been the topics of longstanding debates in the educational literature: memorizing formulas, listening to the teacher, and relating mathematics to daily life. In a multi-level multiple regression analysis, we examined how class-level responses to these items predicted mathematics achievement. In Sweden, across four waves of TIMSS, relating to daily life was a negative predictor of achievement, whereas memorizing formulas and listening to the teacher were positive predictors. This was also the typical pattern of results across all countries participating in two waves of the international TIMSS. Our findings are in line with certain positions on the abovementioned debates. Although conclusions are limited by the correlational nature of the data, we argue that TIMSS is a promising tool for evaluating the effectiveness of different instructional practices.

  abstract      = {BACKGROUND: The parasite Toxoplasma gondii infects 30-60% of humans worldwide. Latent toxoplasmosis, i.e., the life-long presence of Toxoplasma cysts in neural and muscular tissues, leads to prolongation of reaction times in infected subjects. It is not known, however, whether the changes observed in the laboratory influence the performance of subjects in real-life situations. METHODS: The seroprevalence of latent toxoplasmosis in subjects involved in traffic accidents (N = 146) and in the general population living in the same area (N = 446) was compared by a Mantel-Haenszel test for age-stratified data. Correlation between relative risk of traffic accidents and level of anti-Toxoplasma antibody titre was evaluated with the Cochran-Armitage test for trends. RESULTS: A higher seroprevalence was found in the traffic accident set than in the general population (Chi(2)(MH) = 21.45, p < 0.0001). The value of the odds ratio (OR) suggests that subjects with latent toxoplasmosis had a 2.65 (C.I.(95)= 1.76-4.01) times higher risk of an accident than the toxoplasmosis-negative subjects. The OR significantly increased with level of anti-Toxoplasma antibody titre (p < 0.0001), being low (OR = 1.86, C.I.(95) = 1.14-3.03) for the 99 subjects with low antibody titres (8 and 16), higher (OR = 4.78, C.I.(95) = 2.39-9.59) for the 37 subjects with moderate titres (32 and 64), and very high (OR = 16.03, C.I.(95) = 1.89-135.66) for the 6 subjects with titres higher than 64. CONCLUSION: The subjects with latent toxoplasmosis have significantly increased risk of traffic accidents than the noninfected subjects. Relative risk of traffic accidents decreases with the duration of infection. These results suggest that 'asymptomatic' acquired toxoplasmosis might in fact represent a serious and highly underestimated public health problem, as well as an economic problem.},

  abstract      = {The importance of the gut–brain axis in regulating stress-related responses has long been appreciated. More recently, the microbiota has emerged as a key player in the control of this axis, especially during conditions of stress provoked by real or perceived homeostatic challenge. Diet is one of the most important modifying factors of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. The routes of communication between the microbiota and brain are slowly being unravelled, and include the vagus nerve, gut hormone signaling, the immune system, tryptophan metabolism, and microbial metabolites such as short chain fatty acids. The importance of the early life gut microbiota in shaping later health outcomes also is emerging. Results from preclinical studies indicate that alterations of the early microbial composition by way of antibiotic exposure, lack of breastfeeding, birth by Caesarean section, infection, stress exposure, and other environmental influences - coupled with the influence of host genetics - can result in long-term modulation of stress-related physiology and behaviour. The gut microbiota has been implicated in a variety of stress-related conditions including anxiety, depression and irritable bowel syndrome, although this is largely based on animal studies or correlative analysis in patient populations. Additional research in humans is sorely needed to reveal the relative impact and causal contribution of the microbiome to stress-related disorders. In this regard, the concept of psychobiotics is being developed and refined to encompass methods of targeting the microbiota in order to positively impact mental health outcomes. At the 2016 Neurobiology of Stress Workshop in Newport Beach, CA, a group of experts presented the symposium “The Microbiome: Development, Stress, and Disease”. This report summarizes and builds upon some of the key concepts in that symposium within the context of how microbiota might influence the neurobiology of stress.},

The cysts can change the level of the neurotransmitters such as dopamine in the brain and by doing so extend the muscle response time and change personality profiles. In this study, we aimed to determine the frequency of the latent toxoplasmosis (LT) in the driver population who were either injured or died in traffic accidents reported in Istanbul and its suburbs. We compared the results with a control group and discussed the relationship between the LT and the traffic accidents. We included 218 (89.7%) non-fatal, 25 (10.3%) fatal cases in our study as study groups. A total 243 subjects, 234 (96%) male, 9 (4%) female (who were alcohol negative) compared with 191 (95.5%) male and 9 (4.5%) female subjects (control group) who had a traffic accident before but no history of toxoplasmosis were studied. Serologic tests, enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for IgG and IgM, and microimmunoflorescence (MIF) for IgG were used as the reference test, the Sabin–Feldman Dye test (SFDT) was used. According to serologic test results, LT seroprevalence in the study groups was 130 (53.5%) and in the control group 56 (28%) (p<0.0001). A LT was present in 126 out of 234 (53.8%) males in the study groups, and 54 out of 191 (28.3%) males in the control group (p<0.0001). In the 31–44 year age group, there was a significant difference with regard to toxoplasmosis between the study subjects and control groups (p<0.0001). This difference was statistically very significant in (recent and former) cases with middle-aged men (31–44 years old). The results of this retrospective study suggest that LT in drivers, especially those who are between 31 and 44 years might increase the risk for getting involved in a car accident. In a prospective study, Toxoplasma positive and negative subjects can be monitored before they are involved in a traffic accident to clarify the cause and result relationship.},

  abstract      = {Animals have a number of behavioral defenses against infection. For example, they typically avoid sick conspecifics, especially during mating. Most animals also alter their behavior after infection and thereby promote recovery (i.e., sickness behavior). For example, sick animals typically reduce the performance of energetically demanding behaviors, such as sexual behavior. Finally, some animals can increase their reproductive output when they face a life-threatening immune challenge (i.e., terminal reproductive investment). All of these behavioral responses probably rely on immune/neural communication signals for their initiation. Unfortunately, this communication channel is prone to manipulation by parasites. In the case of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), these parasites/pathogens must subvert some of these behavioral defenses for successful transmission. There is evidence that STIs suppress systemic signals of immune activation (e.g., pro-inflammatory cytokines). This manipulation is probably important for the suppression of sickness behavior and other behavioral defenses, as well as for the prevention of attack by the host’s immune system. For example, the cricket, Gryllus texensis, is infected with an STI, the iridovirus IIV-6/CrIV. The virus attacks the immune system, which suffers a dramatic decline in its ability to make proteins important for immune function. This attack also hampers the ability of the immune system to activate sickness behavior. Infected crickets cannot express sickness behavior, even when challenged with heat-killed bacteria. Understanding how STIs suppress sickness behavior in humans and other animals will significantly advance the field of psychoneuroimmunology and could also provide practical benefits.},

  title         = {DNA differences are linked to having same-sex sexual partners},
  journal       = {Science News},
  year          = {2018},
  __markedentry = {[pale:6]},
  abstract      = {SAN DIEGO — For some people, choosing a same-sex partner may be in their DNA.

In a large study of more than 490,000 men and women in the United States, United Kingdom and Sweden, researchers discovered four genetic variants that occur more often in people who indicated on questionnaires that they had had same-sex sexual partners. Andrea Ganna, a geneticist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard reported the results October 19 at the annual meeting of the American Society of Human Genetics. Two of the variants were specific to men’s sexual partner choice. The other two influence sex partner choice for both men and women.

Collectively, the DNA differences explained only 8 to 12 percent of the heritability of having same-sex partners. “There is no gay gene,” Ganna said, “but rather non-heterosexuality is influenced by many tiny-effect genetic factors.”

The new study is an advance over previous attempts to find “gay genes,” says J. Michael Bailey, a psychologist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., who was not involved in the new work. The study’s size is its main advantage, Bailey says. “It’s huge. Huge.”

Researchers examined DNA data from more than 400,000 participants in the U.K. Biobank and more than 69,000 people who had their DNA tested by the consumer testing company 23andMe. People who have given their DNA data to those research projects also answered a battery of questions, including ones about whether they had ever had a partner of the same sex and how many sexual partners they have had. The findings were replicated with data from three other studies, including one from Sweden. Findings from such large studies are more likely to be replicated than the small studies in the past, Bailey says. Researchers have “really gotten these studies down now and if they find things, it’s pretty sure that they’re true.”

Previous sexual orientation genetic studies, including some Bailey was involved in, may also have suffered from bias because they relied on volunteers. People who offer to participate in a study, without being randomly selected, may not reflect the general population, he says. This study includes both men and women and doesn’t rely on twins, as many previous studies have, he says. “It’s a huge advance … but it doesn’t tell us everything we need to know.”

For instance, the study doesn’t address people’s attraction to members of the same sex. Some people who have had sex with a same-sex partner don’t consider themselves gay and aren’t exclusively attracted to people of the same sex, Bailey says. He calls the study’s definition of non-heterosexual behavior as having ever had a same-sex partner “a flawed, but not ridiculous indicator of sexual orientation.”

Men in the new study who said they have had same-sex partners, tended to be more exclusively homosexual than women were, Ganna and colleagues found. But people of both sexes ran the gamut of sexual orientations. In the U.K. Biobank dataset, for example, younger people reported having same-sex partners more often than older people did, probably because homosexual activity was illegal in the United Kingdom until 1967.

This is not the only complex human phenomenon for which we see a genetic influence without a great understanding of how that influence works.

— Lisa Diamond

This is the first DNA difference ever linked to female sexual orientation, says Lisa Diamond, a psychologist at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City who studies the nature and development of same-sex sexuality. The results are consistent with previous studies suggesting genetics may play a bigger role in influencing male sexuality than female sexuality. It’s not unusual for one sex of a species to be more fluid in their sexuality, choosing partners of both sexes, Diamond says. For humans, male sexuality may be more tightly linked to genes.

But that doesn’t mean that genes control sexual behavior or orientation. “Same-sex sexuality appears to be genetically influenced, but not genetically determined,” Diamond says. “This is not the only complex human phenomenon for which we see a genetic influence without a great understanding of how that influence works.” Other complex human behaviors, such as smoking, alcohol use, personality and even job satisfaction all have some genetic component.

Previous research had suggested that genes influencing sexual orientation were located on the X chromosome (SN: 11/4/95. p. 295; SN: 7/7/93, p. 37). But Ganna and colleagues found no evidence that the X chromosome is involved in partner choice, he said.

Instead, the researchers found genetic variants known as single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs, located on four other chromosomes. SNPs are naturally occurring spots in the DNA where some people have one DNA base, or letter, and other people have another. The variants didn’t change any genes, but were found near some genes that may be involved.

For instance, a variant on chromosome 15 linked to men having sex with men is also associated with male pattern baldness. Another variant in the study is near the ORA51A gene on chromosome 11, which is involved in the ability to smell certain chemicals. That’s interesting because smell has been linked to attraction before (SN Online: 3/12/15), Ganna said.  The researchers don’t yet know exactly which genes are involved in mate choice or exactly how they influence behavior.

One mystery the discovery may help solve is how genetic variants associated with having same-sex partners could persist across generations. Such variants would presumably get weeded out if men and women who have sex with people of the same sex don’t have children or have fewer children than the average person.

In the new study, the more exclusively homosexual partners men had, the fewer children they had; up to 80 percent fewer children than heterosexual men. In a preliminary conference report, the researchers suggested that the variants are associated with heterosexuals having more sexual partners than usual, and that heterosexual men with some of the variants are more attractive than those without. Those traits would give heterosexuals a greater chance to pass the variants on to offspring, keeping those DNA differences in the gene pool. Ganna did not discuss those possibilities from the podium. 

Diamond disagrees that researchers need to find a mechanism to explain the persistence of genetic variants linked to homosexuality. Same-sex behavior has never completely supplanted heterosexual mating in any species studied, she says. Only in the last 50 years have gay people tended to exclusively choose same-sex partners, she says. “You don’t really need some reproductive benefit for same-sex sexuality, because same-sex sexuality almost never occurs exclusively. Individuals with that predisposition have been mating and reproducing with heterosexual partners for millennia, and that’s why it’s still in the gene pool.”

  abstract      = {Twin and family studies have shown that sexual orientation is in part genetically influenced (~40% narrow-sense heritability), but previous efforts to identify the specific genes involved have been unsuccessful due to a lack of power. To better understand the genetics underlying sexual orientation and the overlap with other traits and, in particular, with heterosexual behavioral and reproductive traits (e.g. lifetime number of same-sex partners) we performed genome-wide association analyses on 493,001 individuals enrolled in 5 studies from the UK, USA and Sweden. We found 4 genome-wide significant loci for non-heterosexual behavior and 40 loci for the number of opposite-sex partners in heterosexual. We estimated that, in aggregate, common genetic variants account for 8-20% of variation in non-heterosexual behavior and further analyses suggested an overlap with genes underlying sex hormone regulation and olfactory processes.
We detected a substantial degree of heterogeneity in the genetic basis of sexual behavior as these effects were only partially shared among women and men and across different definitions of non-heterosexual behavior.
We found that variants predisposing to non-heterosexual behavior are, among heterosexuals, positively associated with having more self-reported lifetime sexual partners and, in heterosexual males, with being judged more to be physically attractive. This is consistent with the hypothesis that genetic variants predisposing to non-heterosexual behavior confer a mating advantage to heterosexual carriers.
Recognizing the sensitivity of the topic, we have employed best practices for communicating our results including the preregistration of the study plan and the creation of a website to report our findings following feedback obtained through public engagement.},

  abstract      = {In mammals, respiratory-locked hippocampal rhythms are implicated in the scaffolding and transfer of information between sensory and memory networks. These oscillations are entrained by nasal respiration and driven by the olfactory bulb. They then travel to the piriform cortex where they propagate further downstream to the hippocampus and modulate neural processes critical for memory formation. In humans, bypassing nasal airflow through mouth-breathing abolishes these rhythms and impacts encoding as well as recognition processes thereby reducing memory performance. It has been hypothesized that similar behavior should be observed for the consolidation process, the stage between encoding and recognition, were memory is reactivated and strengthened. However, direct evidence for such an effect is lacking in human and non-human animals. Here we tested this hypothesis by examining the effect of respiration on consolidation of episodic odor memory. In two separate sessions, female and male participants encoded odors followed by a one hour awake resting consolidation phase where they either breathed solely through their nose or mouth. Immediately after the consolidation phase, memory for odors was tested. Recognition memory significantly increased during nasal respiration compared to mouth respiration during consolidation. These results provide the first evidence that respiration directly impacts consolidation of episodic events, and lends further support to the notion that core cognitive functions are modulated by the respiratory cycle.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTMemories pass through three main stages in their development: encoding, consolidation, and retrieval. Growing evidence from animal and human studies suggests that respiration plays an important role in the behavioral and neural mechanisms associated with encoding and recognition. Specifically nasal, but not mouth, respiration entrains neural oscillations that enhance the encoding and recognition processes. We demonstrate that respiration also affects the consolidation stage. Breathing through the nose compared to the mouth during consolidation enhances recognition memory. This demonstrates, first, that nasal respiration is important during the critical period were memories are reactivated and strengthened. Second, it suggests that the neural mechanisms responsible may emerge from nasal respiration.},

  abstract      = {Adhesion to the extracellular matrix persists during mitosis in most cell types. However, while classical adhesion complexes, such as focal adhesions, do and must disassemble to enable mitotic rounding, the mechanisms of residual mitotic cell-extracellular matrix adhesion remain undefined. Here, we identify ‘reticular adhesions’, a class of adhesion complex that is mediated by integrin αvβ5, formed during interphase, and preserved at cell-extracellular matrix attachment sites throughout cell division. Consistent with this role, integrin β5 depletion perturbs mitosis and disrupts spatial memory transmission between cell generations. Reticular adhesions are morphologically and dynamically distinct from classical focal adhesions. Mass spectrometry defines their unique composition, enriched in phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2)-binding proteins but lacking virtually all consensus adhesome components. Indeed, reticular adhesions are promoted by PtdIns(4,5)P2, and form independently of talin and F-actin. The distinct characteristics of reticular adhesions provide a solution to the problem of maintaining cell-extracellular matrix attachment during mitotic rounding and division.},

  abstract      = {The human birth canal shows a tight fit with the size of the neonate, which can lead to obstetric complications. This is not the case in other apes, and has been explained as the outcome of conflicting evolutionary pressures for bipedal locomotion and parturition of a highly encephalized fetus. Despite the suggested evolutionary constraints on the female pelvis, we show that women are, in fact, extremely variable in the shape of the bony birth canal, with human populations having differently shaped pelvic canals. Neutral evolution through genetic drift and differential migration are largely responsible for the observed pattern of morphological diversity, which correlates well with neutral genetic diversity. Climatic adaptation might have played a role, albeit a minor one, with populations from colder regions showing a more transversally oval shape of the canal inlet. The significant extent of canal shape variation among women from different regions of the world has important implications for modern obstetric practice in multi-ethnic societies, as modern medical understanding has been largely developed on studies of European women.},

  abstract      = {Most of what we know about the relationship between diversification and environment in ancient marine environments has come from invertebrates. The influence of habitat on vertebrate diversification thus remains a persistent question. Sallan et al. studied fossil vertebrates spanning the mid-Paleozoic, including both jawed and jawless fish (see the Perspective by Pimiento). They found that diversification occurred primarily in nearshore environments, with diversified forms later colonizing deeper marine or freshwater habitats. Furthermore, more robust forms remained in the nearshore, whereas more gracile forms moved to deeper waters. This split is similar to current relationships between form and environment in aquatic habitats.Science, this issue p. 460; see also p. 402Ancestral vertebrate habitats are subject to controversy and obscured by limited, often contradictory paleontological data. We assembled fossil vertebrate occurrence and habitat datasets spanning the middle Paleozoic (480 million to 360 million years ago) and found that early vertebrate clades, both jawed and jawless, originated in restricted, shallow intertidal-subtidal environments. Nearshore divergences gave rise to body plans with different dispersal abilities: Robust fishes shifted shoreward, whereas gracile groups moved seaward. Fresh waters were invaded repeatedly, but movement to deeper waters was contingent upon form and short-lived until the later Devonian. Our results contrast with the onshore-offshore trends, reef-centered diversification, and mid-shelf clustering observed for benthic invertebrates. Nearshore origins for vertebrates may be linked to the demands of their mobility and may have influenced the structure of their early fossil record and diversification.},

Thematic analysis was used to identify key elements of camouflaging, which informed development of a three-stage model of the camouflaging process. First, motivations for camouflaging included fitting in and increasing connections with others. Second, camouflaging itself comprised a combination of masking and compensation techniques. Third, short- and long-term consequences of camouflaging included exhaustion, challenging stereotypes, and threats to self-perception.},

Essay scores were analysed using a multi-faceted Rasch model to compare test-takers’ writing ability estimates, inter-rater agreement, and rater severity and self-consistency across marking methods (holistic vs. analytic) and rater groups (novice vs. experienced). Raters tended to be less severe with analytic marking. Holistic marking led to a higher level of inter-rater agreement, while analytic marking led to higher self-consistency. The two rater groups differed in terms of severity, inter-rater agreement and self-consistency. Furthermore, the two marking methods performed differently across the two rater groups. Overall, the findings suggest that the two marking methods might be useful for different assessment purposes, contexts and raters. Implications for ESL writing assessment practice and research are discussed. },

We investigate whether holistic scores could mask deviances in how underlying descriptors are interpreted and applied by the raters, as such deviances could compromise rating validity. We conducted a study with six raters, comparing a holistic approach with a combined approach whereby an analytic score for each descriptor was collected complementary to the holistic judgements. The results confirmed the initial hypothesis that holistic scores may mask deviances in how descriptors are applied. To monitor rating quality and enhance rating validity, we therefore recommend a complementary approach combining holistic scores with analytic, descriptor-focused scores. We illustrate the applicability of this approach by a successful implementation during rater training. Our findings contribute towards enhancing rater consistency and improving rating validity. },

The notion stems from observations that O2 breathing during exercise enhances athletic performance,1,2 but the connection of O2 breathing during exercise with drinking “hyperoxygenated” water before exercise conflates physics and physiology in a struthonian visit to placebo land. Fuelled by bottled-water mavens, who collect testimonials for oxygenated waters, claims abound of ergogenic benefits of water advertised to hold up to 40 times more O2 than plain water. The issue of hydration aside, such claims have a flimsy rationale and no rigorous experimental support. On close inspection, three scientific problems immediately arise. Firstly, for all practical purposes, supplemental O2 improves performance only during exercise, not before or between bouts.3 With normal lungs, breathing of even pure O2 at sea level increases maximal O2 uptake (o2max) by only 5-10% because air breathing alone, except at high intensity work, keeps the arterial O2 saturation (Sao2) and content (Cao2) very high.2 The next problem is that the solubility of O2 in water (and plasma) is low. The solubility constant obeys Henry’s Law: it is directly proportional to O2 …},

Their more routine activities further influence the biota occupying engineered habitats. Beavers are well-known for transforming ecosystems through dam building and are therefore increasingly being used for habitat restoration, adaptation to climate extremes and in long-term rewilding. Abandoned beaver ponds (BP) develop into meadows or forested wetlands that differ fundamentally from other terrestrial habitats and thus increase landscape diversity. Active BP, by contrast, are superficially similar to other non-engineered shallow wetlands, but ongoing use and maintenance might affect how BP contribute to aquatic biodiversity. We explored the {\textquoteleft}within-habitat{\textquoteright} effect of an ecosystem engineer by comparing active BP in southern Sweden with coexisting other wetlands (OW), using sedentary (plants) and mobile (water beetles) organisms as indicators. BP differed predictably from OW in environmental characteristics and were more heterogeneous. BP supported more plant species at plot (+15\%) and site (+33\%) scales, and plant beta diversity, based on turnover between plots, was 17\% higher than in OW, contributing to a significantly larger species pool in BP (+17\%). Beetles were not differentiated between BP and OW based on diversity measures but were 26\% more abundant in BP. Independent of habitat creation beaver are thus significant agents of within-habitat heterogeneity that differentiates BP from other standing water habitat; as an integral component of the rewilding of wetlands re-establishing beaver should benefit aquatic biodiversity across multiple scales.This article is part of the theme issue {\textquoteleft}Trophic rewilding: consequences for ecosystems under global change{\textquoteright}.},

Extensive follow-up of a large cohort of survivors (120,000) and of their offspring (77,000) was initiated in 1947 and continues to this day. In essence, survivors having received 1 Gy irradiation (\~{}1000 mSV) have a significantly elevated rate of cancer (42\% increase) but a limited decrease of longevity (\~{}1 year), while their offspring show no increased frequency of abnormalities and, so far, no detectable elevation of the mutation rate. Current acceptable exposure levels for the general population and for workers in the nuclear industry have largely been derived from these studies, which have been reported in more than 100 publications. Yet the general public, and indeed most scientists, are unaware of these data: it is widely believed that irradiated survivors suffered a very high cancer burden and dramatically shortened life span, and that their progeny were affected by elevated mutation rates and frequent abnormalities. In this article, I summarize the results and discuss possible reasons for this very striking discrepancy between the facts and general beliefs about this situation.},

This finding contradicts lay beliefs and prominent scientific theories alike and indicates that the development of personality is less determined by the role within the family of origin than previously thought.This study examined the long-standing question of whether a person{\textquoteright}s position among siblings has a lasting impact on that person{\textquoteright}s life course. Empirical research on the relation between birth order and intelligence has convincingly documented that performances on psychometric intelligence tests decline slightly from firstborns to later-borns. By contrast, the search for birth-order effects on personality has not yet resulted in conclusive findings. We used data from three large national panels from the United States (n = 5,240), Great Britain (n = 4,489), and Germany (n = 10,457) to resolve this open research question. This database allowed us to identify even very small effects of birth order on personality with sufficiently high statistical power and to investigate whether effects emerge across different samples. We furthermore used two different analytical strategies by comparing siblings with different birth-order positions (i) within the same family (within-family design) and (ii) between different families (between-family design). In our analyses, we confirmed the expected birth-order effect on intelligence. We also observed a significant decline of a 10th of a SD in self-reported intellect with increasing birth-order position, and this effect persisted after controlling for objectively measured intelligence. Most important, however, we consistently found no birth-order effects on extraversion, emotional stability, agreeableness, conscientiousness, or imagination. On the basis of the high statistical power and the consistent results across samples and analytical designs, we must conclude that birth order does not have a lasting effect on broad personality traits outside of the intellectual domain.},

  abstract      = {Birds are the only living amniotes with coloured eggs1-4, which have long been considered to be an avian innovation1,3. A recent study has demonstrated the presence of both red-brown protoporphyrin IX and blue-green biliverdin5--the pigments responsible for all the variation in avian egg colour--in fossilized eggshell of a nonavian dinosaur6. This raises the fundamental question of whether modern birds inherited egg colour from their nonavian dinosaur ancestors, or whether egg colour evolved independently multiple times. Here we present a phylogenetic assessment of egg colour in nonavian dinosaurs. We applied high-resolution Raman microspectroscopy to eggshells that represent all of the major clades of dinosaurs, and found that egg colour pigments were preserved in all eumaniraptorans: egg colour had a single evolutionary origin in nonavian theropod dinosaurs. The absence of colour in ornithischian and sauropod eggs represents a true signal rather than a taphonomic artefact. Pigment surface maps revealed that nonavian eumaniraptoran eggs were spotted and speckled, and colour pattern diversity in these eggs approaches that in extant birds, which indicates that reproductive behaviours in nonavian dinosaurs were far more complex than previously known3. Depth profiles demonstrated identical mechanisms of pigment deposition in nonavian and avian dinosaur eggs. Birds were not the first amniotes to produce coloured eggs: as with many other characteristics7,8 this is an attribute that evolved deep within the dinosaur tree and long before the spectacular radiation of modern birds.},

  abstract      = {Background Mindfulness based interventions (MBIs) are an increasingly popular way of attempting to improve the behavioural, cognitive and mental health outcomes of children and adolescents, though there is a suggestion that enthusiasm has moved ahead of the evidence base. Most evaluations of MBIs are either uncontrolled or nonrandomized trials. This meta-analysis aims to establish the efficacy of MBIs for children and adolescents in studies that have adopted a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) design. Methods A systematic literature search of RCTs of MBIs was conducted up to October 2017. Thirty-three independent studies including 3,666 children and adolescents were included in random effects meta-analyses with outcome measures categorized into cognitive, behavioural and emotional factors. Separate random effects meta-analyses were completed for the seventeen studies (n = 1,762) that used an RCT design with an active control condition. Results Across all RCTs we found significant positive effects of MBIs, relative to controls, for the outcome categories of Mindfulness, Executive Functioning, Attention, Depression, Anxiety/Stress and Negative Behaviours, with small effect sizes (Cohen's d), ranging from .16 to .30. However, when considering only those RCTs with active control groups, significant benefits of an MBI were restricted to the outcomes of Mindfulness (d = .42), Depression (d = .47) and Anxiety/Stress (d = .18) only. Conclusions This meta-analysis reinforces the efficacy of using MBIs for improving the mental health and wellbeing of youth as assessed using the gold standard RCT methodology. Future RCT evaluations should incorporate scaled-up definitive trial designs to further evaluate the robustness of MBIs in youth, with an embedded focus on mechanisms of action.},

Here, we integrate weekly records of climate, tooth growth, and metal exposure in two Neanderthals and one modern human from southeastern France. The Neanderthals inhabited cooler and more seasonal periods than the modern human, evincing childhood developmental stress during wintertime. In one instance, this stress may have included skeletal mobilization of elemental stores and weight loss; this individual was born in the spring and appears to have weaned 2.5 years later. Both Neanderthals were exposed to lead at least twice during the deep winter and/or early spring. This multidisciplinary approach elucidates direct relationships between ancient environments and hominin paleobiology.},

Nevertheless, our knowledge of the underlying evolutionary mechanisms driving the divergence and emergence of viral oncogenicity in specific types of HPVs is incomplete. To better understand the molecular evolution of oncogenic HPVs, we isolated viruses from non-human primates, evaluated papillomavirus molecular clock models, and estimated the divergence times of HPV16 and other HPV type variants from their most recent common ancestors. Primate PV-host tissue tropisms indicated niche adaptation of viruses to host ecosystems as the first stage of the evolution of oncogenic HPVs. The data also provided evidence of ancient codivergence of HPV variants with archaic hominins and recent viral transmission from Neanderthals to modern non-African humans through sexual intercourse. Understanding the evolution of papillomaviruses should provide important biological insights and suggest mechanisms underlying HPV-induced cervical cancer, since niche adaptation rather than oncogenicity drives viral fitness.},

  abstract      = {Success in school and the labour market relies on more than high intelligence. Associations between ‘non-cognitive’ skills in childhood, such as attention, self-regulation and perseverance, and later outcomes have been widely investigated. In a systematic review of this literature, we screened 9,553 publications, reviewed 554 eligible publications and interpreted results from 222 better-quality publications. Better-quality publications comprised randomized experimental and quasi-experimental intervention studies (EQIs) and observational studies that made reasonable attempts to control confounding. For academic achievement outcomes, there were 26 EQI publications but only 14 were available for meta-analysis, with effects ranging from 0.16 to 0.37 s.d. However, within subdomains, effects were heterogeneous. The 95% prediction interval for literacy was consistent with negative, null and positive effects (−0.13 to 0.79). Similarly, heterogeneous findings were observed for psychosocial, cognitive and language, and health outcomes. Funnel plots of EQIs and observational studies showed asymmetric distributions and potential for small study bias. There is some evidence that non-cognitive skills associate with improved outcomes. However, there is potential for small study and publication bias that may overestimate true effects, and the heterogeneity of effect estimates spanned negative, null and positive effects. The quality of evidence from EQIs underpinning this field is lower than optimal and more than one-third of observational studies made little or no attempt to control confounding. Interventions designed to develop children’s non-cognitive skills could potentially improve outcomes. The interdisciplinary researchers interested in these skills should take a more strategic and rigorous approach to determine which interventions are most effective.},

We classified EI studies into three streams: (1) ability-based models that use objective test items; (2) self-report or peer-report measures based on the four-branch model of EI; and (3) “mixed models” of emotional competencies. The three streams have corrected correlations ranging from 0.24 to 0.30 with job performance. The three streams correlated differently with cognitive ability and with neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Streams 2 and 3 have the largest incremental validity beyond cognitive ability and the Five Factor Model (FFM). Dominance analysis demonstrated that all three streams of EI exhibited substantial relative importance in the presence of FFM and intelligence when predicting job performance. Publication bias had negligible influence on observed effect sizes. The results support the overall validity of EI. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

This first formal meta-analysis on the topic revealed worldwide IQ gains across more than one century (1909–2013), based on 271 independent samples, totaling almost 4 million participants, from 31 countries. Key findings include that IQ gains vary according to domain (estimated 0.41, 0.30, 0.28, and 0.21 IQ points annually for fluid, spatial, full-scale, and crystallized IQ test performance, respectively), are stronger for adults than children, and have decreased in more recent decades. Altogether, these findings narrow down proposed theories and candidate factors presumably accounting for the Flynn effect. Factors associated with life history speed seem mainly responsible for the Flynn effect’s general trajectory, whereas favorable social multiplier effects and effects related to economic prosperity appear to be responsible for observed differences of the Flynn effect across intelligence domains. },

We confirm a latent 3 factor structure, using a subset of the items from the MBI-ES that adequately fit both samples. We tested different degrees of measurement invariance (model fit statistics, scale reliabilities, residual variances, item thresholds, and total variance) to describe and compare cultural differences. Results indicate some differences between the samples at the structure and item levels. We found that factor variances were slightly higher in the New York City teacher sample. Emotional Exhaustion (EE) was a more informative construct for differentiating among teachers at moderate levels of burnout, as opposed to extreme high or low levels of burnout, in both cultures. In contrast, Depersonalization in the Workplace (DW) was more informative at the more extreme levels of burnout among both teacher samples. By studying the influence of culture on the experience of burnout we can further our understanding of burnout and potentially discover factors that might prevent burnout among primary and secondary school teachers.},

Social hierarchies guide behavior in many species, including humans, where status also has an enormous impact on motivation and health. However, little is known about the underlying neural representation of social hierarchies in humans. In the present study, we identify dissociable neural responses to perceived social rank using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in an interactive, simulated social context. In both stable and unstable social hierarchies, viewing a superior individual differentially engaged perceptual-attentional, saliency, and cognitive systems, notably dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In the unstable hierarchy setting, additional regions related to emotional processing (amygdala), social cognition (medial prefrontal cortex), and behavioral readiness were recruited. Furthermore, social hierarchical consequences of performance were neurally dissociable and of comparable salience to monetary reward, providing a neural basis for the high motivational value of status. Our results identify neural mechanisms that may mediate the enormous influence of social status on human behavior and health.},

  abstract      = {What contributes to gender-associated differences in preferences such as the willingness to take risks, patience, altruism, positive and negative reciprocity, and trust? Falk and Hermle studied 80,000 individuals in 76 countries who participated in a Global Preference Survey and compared the data with country-level variables such as gross domestic product and indices of gender inequality. They observed that the more that women have equal opportunities, the more they differ from men in their preferences.Science, this issue p. eaas9899INTRODUCTIONUnderstanding determinants of gender differences in economic and social domains has been of interest, both in academic and public debates. Previous research has shown that gender differences in fundamental economic preferences are important in explaining gender differences in economic outcomes, such as for occupational choice, financial investment, or educational decisions, among many others. However, gaps remain in understanding the sources of gender differences in preferences and their variation.RATIONALEWe contrasted and tested two hypotheses that make opposite predictions concerning the cross-country association of gender differences in preferences with economic development and gender equality. On one hand, the attenuation of gender-specific social roles that arises in more developed and gender-egalitarian countries may alleviate differences in preferences between women and men. As a consequence, one would expect gender differences in preferences to be negatively associated with higher levels of economic development and gender equality (social role hypothesis). On the other hand, greater availability of material and social resources removes the gender-neutral goal of subsistence, which creates the scope for gender-specific ambitions and desires. In addition, more gender-equal access to those resources may allow women and men to express preferences independently from each other. As a consequence, one would expect gender differences in preferences to be positively associated with higher levels of economic development and gender equality (resource hypothesis).We tested these competing predictions using data on experimentally validated measures of willingness to take risks, patience, altruism, positive and negative reciprocity, and trust for 80,000 individuals in 76 representative country samples. So that the data would be geographically representative, the dataset was chosen so as to include all continents and a broad range of cultures and economic development levels. In total, the data represent about 90\% of both the world population and global income.RESULTSThe data revealed substantial cross-country variation in gender differences in preferences. Gender differences were found to be strongly positively associated with economic development as well as gender equality. These relationships held for each preference separately as well as for a summary index of differences in all preferences jointly. Quantitatively, this summary index exhibited correlations of 0.67 (P \&lt; 0.0001) with log GDP per capita and 0.56 (P \&lt; 0.0001) with a Gender Equality Index (a joint measure of four indices of gender equality), respectively. To isolate the separate impacts of economic development and gender equality, we conducted a conditional analysis, finding a quantitatively large and statistically significant association between gender differences and log GDP per capita conditional on the Gender Equality Index, and vice versa. These findings remained robust in several validation tests, such as accounting for potential culture-specific survey response behavior, aggregation bias, and nonlinear relationships.CONCLUSIONThe reported evidence indicates that higher levels of economic development and gender equality favor the manifestation of gender differences in preferences across countries. Our results highlight the critical role of availability of material and social resources, as well as gender-equal access to these resources, in facilitating the independent formation and expression of gender-specific preferences.Gender differences in preferences across countries and their association with economic development and gender equality.(Left) World map visualizing a summary index of gender differences in all six preferences (risk-taking, patience, altruism, trust, and positive and negative reciprocity). (Right) The relationship between the summary index of gender differences in preferences and (top) log GDP per capita and (bottom) a Gender Equality Index comprising measures of material, social, and political gender equality. The relationships are predicted from local polynomial regressions. Shaded areas indicate 95\% confidence intervals.Preferences concerning time, risk, and social interactions systematically shape human behavior and contribute to differential economic and social outcomes between women and men. We present a global investigation of gender differences in six fundamental preferences. Our data consist of measures of willingness to take risks, patience, altruism, positive and negative reciprocity, and trust for 80,000 individuals in 76 representative country samples. Gender differences in preferences were positively related to economic development and gender equality. This finding suggests that greater availability of and gender-equal access to material and social resources favor the manifestation of gender-differentiated preferences across countries.},

We conducted Mendelian randomization analyses using genetic variants associated with the perception of bitter substances (rs1726866 for propylthiouracil [PROP], rs10772420 for quinine and rs2597979 for caffeine) to evaluate the intake of coffee, tea and alcohol among up to 438,870 UK Biobank participants. A standard deviation (SD) higher in genetically predicted bitterness of caffeine was associated with increased coffee intake (0.146 [95%CI: 0.103, 0.189] cups/day), whereas a SD higher in those of PROP and quinine was associated with decreased coffee intake (−0.021 [−0.031, −0.011] and −0.081 [−0.108, −0.054] cups/day respectively). Higher caffeine perception was also associated with increased risk of being a heavy (>4 cups/day) coffee drinker (OR 1.207 [1.126, 1.294]). Opposite pattern of associations was observed for tea possibly due to the inverse relationship between both beverages. Alcohol intake was only negatively associated with PROP perception (−0.141 [−1.88, −0.94] times/month per SD increase in PROP bitterness). Our results reveal that bitter perception is causally associated with intake of coffee, tea and alcohol, suggesting a role of bitter taste in the development of bitter beverage consumption.},

Nearly a century of observational studies and more recent longitudinal surveys reveal that, in infancy, girls and boys use force at similar rates. Over the next few years boys become significantly more aggressive. Alternative hypotheses accounting for the widening gender gap are evaluated. These include hypotheses about normative patterns of male escalation and female desistance; boys' preference for active play that promotes aggression; girls' tendency to hide aggression; girls' use of alternative forms of aggression; boys' increased risk for the cognitive and emotional problems that are linked to aggression; boys' sensitivity to situational triggers of aggression; and boys' vulnerability to adverse rearing environments. The evidence bearing on each hypothesis is mixed. In general, the overall difference between the sexes appears to be produced by a minority of boys who deploy aggression at high rates. Three general principles govern the emergence of sex differences in aggression: female precocity, male vulnerability, and the salience of sex as a social category that shapes children's lives.},

Hence, survey questionnaires usually ask people to rate their well-being in different domains. The common practice of comparing well-being by means of averages or linear regressions ignores the fact that well-being is an ordinal variable. Since data is ordinal, monotonic increasing transformations are permissible. We illustrate the sensitivity of empirical studies to monotonic transformations using examples that relate to well-known empirical papers, and provide two theoretical conditions that enable us to rank ordinal variables. In our examples, monotonic increasing transformations can in fact reverse the conclusion reached.},

Parental concern regarding ingestion applies across a range of materials. In this study, we aimed to determine typical transit times for another commonly swallowed object: a Lego figurine head. Methods Six paediatric health-care professionals were recruited to swallow a Lego head. Previous gastrointestinal surgery, inability to ingest foreign objects and aversion to searching through faecal matter were all exclusion criteria. Pre-ingestion bowel habit was standardised by the Stool Hardness and Transit (SHAT) score. Participants ingested a Lego head, and the time taken for the object to be found in the participants stool was recorded. The primary outcome was the Found and Retrieved Time (FART) score. Results The FART score averaged 1.71 days. There was some evidence that females may be more accomplished at searching through their stools than males, but this could not be statistically validated. Conclusions A toy object quickly passes through adult subjects with no complications. This will reassure parents, and the authors advocate that no parent should be expected to search through their child's faeces to prove object retrieval.},

  abstract      = {The planetary building blocks that formed in the terrestrial planet region were likely very dry, yet water is comparatively abundant on Earth. Here we review the various mechanisms proposed for the origin of water on the terrestrial planets. Various in-situ mechanisms have been suggested, which allow for the incorporation of water into the local planetesimals in the terrestrial planet region or into the planets themselves from local sources, although all of those mechanisms have difficulties. Comets have also been proposed as a source, although there may be problems fitting isotopic constraints, and the delivery efficiency is very low, such that it may be difficult to deliver even a single Earth ocean of water this way. The most promising route for water delivery is the accretion of material from beyond the snow line, similar to carbonaceous chondrites, that is scattered into the terrestrial planet region as the planets are growing. Two main scenarios are discussed in detail. First is the classical scenario in which the giant planets begin roughly in their final locations and the disk of planetesimals and embryos in the terrestrial planet region extends all the way into the outer asteroid belt region. Second is the Grand Tack scenario, where early inward and outward migration of the giant planets implants material from beyond the snow line into the asteroid belt and terrestrial planet region, where it can be accreted by the growing planets. Sufficient water is delivered to the terrestrial planets in both scenarios. While the Grand Tack scenario provides a better fit to most constraints, namely the small mass of Mars, planets may form too fast in the nominal case discussed here. This discrepancy may be reduced as a wider range of initial conditions is explored. Finally, we discuss several more recent models that may have important implications for water delivery to the terrestrial planets.},

HDS-induced liver injury now accounts for 20\% of cases of hepatotoxicity in the United States based on research data. The major implicated agents include anabolic steroids, green tea extract, and multi-ingredient nutritional supplements. Anabolic steroids marketed as bodybuilding supplements typically induce a prolonged cholestatic but ultimately self-limiting liver injury that has a distinctive serum biochemical as well as histological phenotype. Green tea extract and many other products, in contrast, tend to cause an acute hepatitis-like injury. Currently, however, the majority of cases of HDS-associated liver injury are due to multi-ingredient nutritional supplements, and the component responsible for the toxicity is usually unknown or can only be suspected. HDS-induced liver injury presents many clinical and research challenges in diagnosis, identification of the responsible constituents, treatment, and prevention. Also important are improvements in regulatory oversight of nonprescription products to guarantee their constituents and ensure purity and safety. The confident identification of injurious ingredients within HDS will require strategic alignments among clinicians, chemists, and toxicologists. The ultimate goal should be to prohibit or more closely regulate potentially injurious ingredients and thus promote public safety. (Hepatology 2017;65:363-373).},

  abstract      = {Abstract Increasing air temperatures are changing the arctic tundra biome. Permafrost is thawing, snow duration is decreasing, shrub vegetation is proliferating, and boreal wildlife is encroaching. Here we present evidence of the recent range expansion of North American beaver (Castor canadensis) into the Arctic, and consider how this ecosystem engineer might reshape the landscape, biodiversity, and ecosystem processes. We developed a remote sensing approach that maps formation and disappearance of ponds associated with beaver activity. Since 1999, 56 new beaver pond complexes were identified, indicating that beavers are colonizing a predominantly tundra region (18,293 km2) of northwest Alaska. It is unclear how improved tundra stream habitat, population rebound following overtrapping for furs, or other factors are contributing to beaver range expansion. We discuss rates and likely routes of tundra beaver colonization, as well as effects on permafrost, stream ice regimes, and freshwater and riparian habitat. Beaver ponds and associated hydrologic changes are thawing permafrost. Pond formation increases winter water temperatures in the pond and downstream, likely creating new and more varied aquatic habitat, but specific biological implications are unknown. Beavers create dynamic wetlands and are agents of disturbance that may enhance ecosystem responses to warming in the Arctic.},

  abstract      = {Though our current extinction crisis is substantial, it pales in comparison to the largest extinction in Earth{\textquoteright}s history, which occurred at the end of the Permian Period. Referred to as the {\textquotedblleft}Great Dying,{\textquotedblright} this event saw the loss of up to 96\% of all marine species and 70\% of terrestrial species. Penn et al. explored the extinction dynamics of the time using Earth system models in conjunction with physiological data across animal taxa (see the Perspective by Kump). They conclude that increased marine temperatures and reduced oxygen availability were responsible for a majority of the recorded extinctions. Because similar environmental alterations are predicted outcomes of current climate change, we would be wise to take note.Science, this issue p. eaat1327; see also p. 1113INTRODUCTIONClimate change triggered by volcanic greenhouse gases is hypothesized to have caused the largest mass extinction in Earth{\textquoteright}s history at the end of the Permian Period (~252 million years ago). Geochemical evidence provides strong support for rapid global warming and accompanying ocean oxygen (O2) loss, but a quantitative link among climate, species{\textquoteright} traits, and extinction is lacking. To test whether warming and O2 loss can mechanistically account for the marine mass extinction, we combined climate model simulations with an established ecophysiological framework to predict the biogeographic patterns and severity of extinction. Those predictions were confirmed by a spatially explicit analysis of the marine fossil record.RATIONALEThe impact of climate change on marine biodiversity depends on both its magnitude and on species{\textquoteright} diverse biological sensitivities. Tolerances of marine animals to warming and O2 loss are physiologically related and can be represented in a single metric: the ratio of temperature-dependent O2 supply and demand rates. This ratio, termed the Metabolic Index (Φ), measures the environmental scope for aerobic activity and is governed by ocean conditions as well as thermal and hypoxia sensitivity traits that vary across species. If climate warming and O2 loss reduce Φ below the species-specific minimum requirement for sustained ecological activity (Φcrit), the ocean would no longer support active aerobic metabolism and, by extension, long-term population persistence.RESULTSWe simulated the greenhouse gas{\textendash}driven global warming at the end of the Permian using a model of Earth{\textquoteright}s climate and coupled biogeochemical cycles that matches geochemical proxy data. The imposed increase in atmospheric greenhouse gas levels raises near-surface ocean temperatures by more than ~10{\textdegree}C and depletes global marine O2 levels by almost 80\%.To predict the impact of these changes on animal habitat and survival, we measured the frequencies of Metabolic Index traits in diverse living species and used them to define a set of model ecophysiotypes. We populated the model Permian ocean with each ecophysiotype wherever conditions provide viable habitat (Φ >= Φcrit), yielding an ocean with diverse, locally adapted ecophysiotypes throughout all regions. Across the climate transition, however, ocean warming increases the metabolic O2 demand amid declining supply; this removes large fractions of global aerobic habitat for the vast majority of ecophysiotypes and implies a high likelihood of extinction. We simulated the resulting mass extinction of ecophysiotypes and found a robust geographic pattern: Extinction intensity should have been lower in the tropics than at high latitudes. The cause of lower tropical extinction is that organisms initially inhabiting these warm, low-O2 environments can better exploit those conditions when they arise globally, whereas the habitats of more polar species disappear completely.To test the geographic selectivity of the model extinction, we compared model predictions to spatially explicit reconstructions of genus extinction from the marine fossil record. We found that across diverse taxonomic groups, the observed extinction intensity indeed increases with latitude, consistent with the predicted signature of aerobic habitat loss. Comparison of the model to the fossil record implies that temperature-dependent hypoxia can account for more than half of the observed magnitude of regional extinction (i.e., extirpation).CONCLUSIONOcean warming and O2 loss simulated in an Earth System Model of end-Permian climate change imply widespread loss of aerobic habitat among animal types with diverse thermal and hypoxia tolerances. The resulting extinctions are predicted to select most strongly against higher-latitude species, whose biogeographic niche disappears globally. The combined physiological stresses of ocean warming and O2 loss largely account for the spatial pattern and magnitude of extinction observed in the fossil record of the {\textquotedblleft}Great Dying.{\textquotedblright} These results highlight the future extinction risk arising from a depletion of the ocean{\textquoteright}s aerobic capacity that is already under way.Schematic illustration of temperature-dependent hypoxia as a driver of the end-Permian marine mass extinction.Greenhouse gas forcing in a model of Earth{\textquoteright}s climate at the end of the Permian drives ocean warming (contours) and oxygen loss that match geochemical proxy data. Ocean warming raises the organismal O2 demand amid declining supply. The resulting loss of aerobic habitat for diverse physiologies induces a mass extinction in model animal types (line) whose geographic signature{\textemdash}increased severity outside of the tropics{\textemdash}is consistent with reconstructions from the marine fossil record (circles).ILLUSTRATION BY J. PENN AND C. DEUTSCH; FOSSIL DRAWINGS BY E. HAECKEL; PHOTOS BY W. KAVENEY (BLUE CRAB), H. FJELD (ATLANTIC COD), J. WHITE (CHAMBERED NAUTILUS)Rapid climate change at the end of the Permian Period (~252 million years ago) is the hypothesized trigger for the largest mass extinction in Earth{\textquoteright}s history. We present model simulations of the Permian/Triassic climate transition that reproduce the ocean warming and oxygen (O2) loss indicated by the geologic record. The effect of these changes on animal survival is evaluated using the Metabolic Index (Φ), a measure of scope for aerobic activity governed by organismal traits sampled in diverse modern species. Modeled loss of aerobic habitat predicts lower extinction intensity in the tropics, a pattern confirmed with a spatially explicit analysis of the marine fossil record. The combined physiological stresses of ocean warming and O2 loss can account for more than half the magnitude of the {\textquotedblleft}Great Dying.{\textquotedblright}},

Here we demonstrate that mutational inactivation of spr, coding for a muramyl endopeptidase, significantly sensitizes Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium to vancomycin without any accompanying apparent growth defect or outer membrane destabilization. A similar phenotype was not achieved by deleting the mepA, pbpG, nlpC, yebA or yhdO genes coding for functional homologues to Spr. The spr mutant revealed increased autolytic behavior in response to not only vancomycin, but also to penicillin G, an antibiotic for which the mutant displayed a wild-type MIC. A screen for suppressor mutations of the spr mutant phenotype revealed that deletion of tsp (prc), encoding a periplasmic carboxypeptidase involved in processing Spr and PBP3, restored intrinsic resistance to vancomycin and reversed the autolytic phenotype of an spr mutant. Our data suggest that Spr contributes to intrinsic antibiotic resistance in S. Typhimurium without directly affecting the outer membrane permeability barrier. Furthermore, our data suggests that compounds that target specific cell wall endopeptidases might have the potential to expand the activity spectrum of traditional Gram-positive antibiotics.},

  abstract      = {Objectives Several studies have indicated that early pet keeping could protect the infant from later allergy development. Here, we investigate if there is a dose-dependent association between cat- and dog-keeping during the first year of life and subsequent allergy development.   Methods Two cohorts were investigated: a cross-sectional questionnaire-based study of 7- to 8-year-old children (N = 1029) from Mölndal and Kiruna, and a birth-cohort of children from the Västra Götaland county clinically evaluated for asthma and allergy by paediatricians up to the age of 8–9 years (N = 249). The cross-sectional study asked validated questions on asthma and allergy that had been used in two previous studies of children from the same areas. In the birth-cohort study, a diagnosis of asthma and allergy was based on predefined clinical criteria, and laboratory evaluation included blood eosinophils, skin-prick tests and specific immunoglobulin E analyses. Information on pets during first year of life was collected retrospectively in the Cross-Sectional Cohort and prospectively in the Birth Cohort.   Results A dose-response association was seen, with less allergic manifestations (any of asthma, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, or eczema) with increasing number of household cats and dogs during the first year of life. In the Cross-Sectional Cohort, allergy ever decreased from 49% in those with no pets to zero in those with five or more pets (P-value for trend 0.038), and from 32% to zero for allergy last year (P-value for trend 0.006). The same pattern was seen in Birth Cohort. Sensitization to animals, as well as pollens, also decreased with increasing number of animals in the household.   Conclusion The prevalence of allergic disease in children aged 7–9 years is reduced in a dose-dependent fashion with the number of household pets living with the child during their first year of life, suggesting a “mini-farm” effect, whereby cats and dogs protect against allergy development.},

  abstract      = { ABSTRACTIn panel data models and other regressions with unobserved effects, fixed effects estimation is often paired with cluster-robust variance estimation (CRVE) to account for heteroscedasticity and un-modeled dependence among the errors. Although asymptotically consistent, CRVE can be biased downward when the number of clusters is small, leading to hypothesis tests with rejection rates that are too high. More accurate tests can be constructed using bias-reduced linearization (BRL), which corrects the CRVE based on a working model, in conjunction with a Satterthwaite approximation for t-tests. We propose a generalization of BRL that can be applied in models with arbitrary sets of fixed effects, where the original BRL method is undefined, and describe how to apply the method when the regression is estimated after absorbing the fixed effects. We also propose a small-sample test for multiple-parameter hypotheses, which generalizes the Satterthwaite approximation for t-tests. In simulations covering a wide range of scenarios, we find that the conventional cluster-robust Wald test can severely over-reject while the proposed small-sample test maintains Type I error close to nominal levels. The proposed methods are implemented in an R package called clubSandwich. This article has online supplementary materials. },

  abstract      = {Antarctic terrestrial biodiversity occurs almost exclusively in ice-free areas that cover less than 1% of the continent. Climate change will alter the extent and configuration of ice-free areas, yet the distribution and severity of these effects remain unclear. Here we quantify the impact of twenty-first century climate change on ice-free areas under two Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate forcing scenarios using temperature-index melt modelling. Under the strongest forcing scenario, ice-free areas could expand by over 17,000 km2 by the end of the century, close to a 25% increase. Most of this expansion will occur in the Antarctic Peninsula, where a threefold increase in ice-free area could drastically change the availability and connectivity of biodiversity habitat. Isolated ice-free areas will coalesce, and while the effects on biodiversity are uncertain, we hypothesize that they could eventually lead to increasing regional-scale biotic homogenization, the extinction of less-competitive species and the spread of invasive species.},

  abstract      = {Knowledge of the life cycles of non-native species in Antarctica is key to understanding their ability to establish and spread to new regions. Through laboratory studies and field observations on Signy Island (South Orkney Islands, maritime Antarctic), we detail the life stages and phenology of Eretmoptera murphyi (Schaeffer 1914), a brachypterous chironomid midge introduced to Signy in the 1960s from sub-Antarctic South Georgia where it is endemic. We confirm that the species is parthenogenetic and suggest that this enables E. murphyi to have an adult emergence period that extends across the entire maritime Antarctic summer season, unlike its sexually reproducing sister species Belgica antarctica which is itself endemic to the Antarctic Peninsula and South Shetland Islands. We report details of previously undescribed life stages, including verification of four larval instars, pupal development, egg gestation and development, reproductive viability and discuss potential environmental cues for transitioning between these developmental stages. Whilst reproductive success is limited to an extent by high mortality at eclosion, failure to oviposit and low egg-hatching rate, the population is still able to potentially double in size with every life cycle.},

Organismal biology has been steadily losing fashion in both formal education and scientific research. Simultaneous with this is an observable decrease in the connection between humans, their environment, and the organisms with which they share the planet. Nonetheless, we propose that organismal biology can facilitate scientific observation, discovery, research, and engagement, especially when the organisms of focus are ubiquitous and charismatic animals such as spiders. Despite being often feared, spiders are mysterious and intriguing, offering a useful foundation for the effective teaching and learning of scientific concepts and processes. In order to provide an entryway for teachers and students—as well as scientists themselves—into the biology of spiders, we compiled a list of 99 record breaking achievements by spiders (the “Spider World Records”). We chose a world-record style format, as this is known to be an effective way to intrigue readers of all ages. We highlighted, for example, the largest and smallest spiders, the largest prey eaten, the fastest runners, the highest fliers, the species with the longest sperm, the most venomous species, and many more. We hope that our compilation will inspire science educators to embrace the biology of spiders as a resource that engages students in science learning. By making these achievements accessible to non-arachnologists and arachnologists alike, we suggest that they could be used: (i) by educators to draw in students for science education, (ii) to highlight gaps in current organismal knowledge, and (iii) to suggest novel avenues for future research efforts. Our contribution is not meant to be comprehensive, but aims to raise public awareness on spiders, while also providing an initial database of their record breaking achievements.

Whilst exposed to altitude-cold diuresis, participants were subjected to a crossover experimental design comprising two 24-h dietary interventions. In the ``tea'' condition, hot brewed tea formed a major part of fluid intake, whereas in the ``no-tea'' condition tea was excluded from the diet. Subjects were prohibited in both cases from consuming other caffeinated beverages, caffeinated foods, and alcoholic drinks. Mean fluids ingested [mean (SE); tea=3,193 (259) ml versus no tea=3,108 (269) ml] and urine volume (tea=2,686 (276) ml versus no tea=2,625 (342) ml] were similar under both conditions. Statistical analysis found no difference in urine stimulated as a result of the tea intervention (P=0.81). Several markers of hydration status were also taken immediately pre and post each condition, including measures of urine specific gravity, urine electrolyte balance (K+, Na+), and urine colour. None of these measures indicated a difference in hydration status as a result of the dietary intervention in either the control or tea condition. A difference was, however, found in mood, with subjects reporting reduced fatigue when tea was included in the diet (P=0.005). The study shows therefore that even when drunk at high altitude where fluid balance is stressed, there is no evidence that tea acts as a diuretic when consumed through natural routes of ingestion by regular tea drinkers, but that it does have a positive effect on mood.},

Unlike ostensibly similar emotional experiences such as “aesthetic chills” from music and awe-inspiring scenarios, the psychological basis of ASMR has not yet been established. We present two studies (one large-scale online experiment; one laboratory study) that test the emotional and physiological correlates of the ASMR response. Both studies showed that watching ASMR videos increased pleasant affect only in people who experienced ASMR. Study 2 showed that ASMR was associated with reduced heart rate and increased skin conductance levels. Findings indicate that ASMR is a reliable and physiologically-rooted experience that may have therapeutic benefits for mental and physical health.},

Here we systematically review the existing human brain imaging literature on sexual behavior and show that the functional neuroanatomy of sexual behavior is comparable to that involved in processing other rewarding stimuli. Sexual behavior clearly follows the established principles and phases for wanting, liking and satiety involved in the pleasure cycle of other rewards. The studies have uncovered the brain networks involved in sexual wanting or motivation/anticipation, as well as sexual liking or arousal/consummation, while there is very little data on sexual satiety or post-orgasmic refractory period. Human sexual behavior also interacts with other pleasures, most notably social interaction and high arousal states. We discuss the changes in the underlying brain networks supporting sexual behavior in the context of the pleasure cycle, the changes to this cycle over the individual's life-time and the interactions between them. Overall, it is clear from the data that the functional neuroanatomy of sex is very similar to that of other pleasures and that it is unlikely that there is anything special about the brain mechanisms and networks underlying sex.},

Marine long-chain omega-3 fatty acids have been positively related to markers of fecundity in both men and women. However, seafood, their primary food source, can also be a source of toxicants, which could counteract the reproductive benefits.

Objective
To examine the relationship of male and female seafood intake with time to pregnancy (TTP).

Design
Our prospective cohort study included 501 couples planning pregnancy, who participated in the Longitudinal Investigation of Fertility and the Environment study (2005 to 2009) and were followed up for ≤1 year or until pregnancy was detected. Seafood intake was collected daily during follow-up in journals.

Setting
Couples residing in Michigan and Texas were recruited using population-based sampling frameworks.

Main Outcome Measures
The primary outcome was the TTP, determined using an in-home pregnancy test. A secondary outcome was sexual intercourse frequency (SIF) as recorded in the daily journals.

Results
Couples with male and female partners who consumed eight or more seafood servings per cycle had 47% (95% CI, 7% to 103%) and 60% (95% CI, 15% to 122%) greater fecundity (shorter TTP) than couples with male and female partners who consumed one or fewer seafood servings per cycle. Couples with both partners consuming eight or more seafood servings per cycle had 61% (95% CI, 17% to 122%) greater fecundity than couples consuming less. Male and female partners with the highest seafood intake (eight or more servings per cycle) also had 22% greater SIF.

Conclusions
Greater male and female seafood intake was associated with a higher SIF and fecundity among a large prospective cohort of couples attempting pregnancy.},

We apply a difference-in-difference approach using administrative panel data on course grades of local students enrolled at Maastricht University before and during the partial cannabis prohibition. We find that the academic performance of students who are no longer legally permitted to buy cannabis substantially increases. Grade improvements are driven by younger students and the effects are stronger for women and low performers. In line with how cannabis consumption affects cognitive functioning, we find that performance gains are larger for courses that require more numerical/mathematical skills. Our investigation of underlying channels using course evaluations suggests that performance gains are driven by an improved understanding of the material rather than changes in students’ study effort.}},

However, clinical application of recommended HbA1c targets that were based on these studies was difficult due to lack of comparability of HbA1c results among assay methods and laboratories. Thus, the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) was initiated in 1996 with the goal of standardizing HbA1c results to those of the DCCT/UKPDS. HbA1c standardization efforts have been highly successful; however, a number of issues have emerged on the “long and winding road” to better HbA1c, including the development of a higher-order HbA1c reference method by the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC), recommendations to use HbA1c to diagnose as well as monitor diabetes, and point-of-care (POC) HbA1c testing. Here, we review the past, present and future of HbA1c standardization and describe the current status of HbA1c testing, including limitations that healthcare providers need to be aware of when interpreting HbA1c results.},

  abstract      = {Background
Assays for immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain (HLC) pairs called Hevylite® have recently been developed. These assays can be useful in patients with hard to interpret serum protein electrophoresis peaks. Measurement of the biological variation of clinical laboratory tests can help clinicians better interpret laboratory results.
Methods
Serum samples were collected from 15 healthy donors and assayed with IgAκ, IgAλ, IgGκ and IgGλ Hevylite. The coefficients of the within-subject and between-subject biological variation, index of individuality (II), number of samples (n) required to determine the homeostatic setting points (HSP) and reference change values (RCV) were calculated.
Results
The coefficients of the within-subject biologic variation were all less than the between-subject biological variation. The II for all the assays and their κ/λ ratios were near or <0.6. The RCV ranged from 17 to 41%. The number of measurements to determine the HSP for an individual was 1 for the HLC ratios and between 2 and 9 for the individual isoforms.
Conclusions
II indicates it is better to use the patient's individual results rather than population based reference values, fewer measurements are required to determine the HSP for the HLC ratios than the individual isoforms and the RCV can now be used to aid in interpretation.},

These beneficial effects were paralleled by an increase in SOs and in slow and fast spindles during N3, without affecting the physiological SO-spindle phase coupling. We then confirm that, during the rocking night, overnight memory consolidation was enhanced and also correlated with the increase in fast spindles, whose co-occurrence with the SO up-state is considered to foster cortical synaptic plasticity. Finally, supporting the hypothesis that a rhythmic stimulation entrains sleep oscillations, we report a temporal clustering of spindles and SOs relative to the rocking cycle. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that a continuous rocking stimulation strengthens deep sleep via the neural entrainment of intrinsic sleep oscillations.

•
Novel task enables model-based analysis and decomposition of theory of mind (ToM)
•

ToM impairment in ASD was specific; belief tracking and ToM reasoning remained intact
•
Model parameters correlate with ASD symptom severity, pointing to new research targets


Inferring the beliefs, desires, and intentions of other
people (‘‘theory of mind,’’ ToM) requires specialized psychological processes that represent the
minds of others as distinct from our own [1–3].
ToM is engaged ubiquitously in our everyday social
behavior and features a specific developmental trajectory [4] that is notably delayed in children with
autism spectrum disorder (ASD) [5, 6]. In healthy individuals, model-based analyses of social learning
and decision-making have successfully elucidated
specific computational components of ToM processing [7–11]. However, the use of this approach
to study ToM impairment in ASD has been
extremely limited [10, 12]. To better characterize
specific ToM impairment in ASD, we developed a
novel learning task and applied model-based analyses in high-functioning adults with ASD and
matched healthy controls. After completing a charitable donation task, participants performed a
‘‘mentalizer’’ task in which they observed another
person (the agent) complete the same charity
task. The mentalizer task probed the participants’
ability to acquire and use ToM representations. To
accurately predict agent behavior, participants
needed to dynamically track the agent’s beliefs
(true or false) about an experimental context that
varied over time and use that information to infer
the agent’s intentions from their actions. ASD participants were specifically impaired at using their
estimates of agent belief to learn agent intentions,
though their ability to track agent belief was intact
and their reasoning about belief and intentions
was rational. Furthermore, model parameters
correlated with aspects of social functioning, e.g.,
ADOS severity scores [13]. Together, these results
identify novel, and more specific, targets for future
research.},

Bayesian coalescent analyses place polar bears outside the brown bear clade and date the divergence much earlier, in the middle Pleistocene, about 600 (338 to 934) thousand years ago.

  abstract      = {Background
Objective interpretation of laboratory test results used to diagnose and monitor diabetes mellitus in part requires the application of biological variation data (BVD). The quality of published BVD has been questioned. The aim of this study was to quality assess publications reporting BVD for diabetes-related analytes using the Biological Variation Data Critical Appraisal Checklist (BIVAC); to assess whether published BVD are fit for purpose and whether the study design and population attributes influence BVD estimates and to undertake a meta-analysis of the BVD from BIVAC-assessed publications.
Methods
Publications reporting data for glucose, HbA1c, adiponectin, C-peptide, fructosamine, insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), insulin like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3), insulin, lactate and pyruvate were identified using a systematic literature search. These publications were assessed using the BIVAC, receiving grades A, B, C or D, where A is of highest quality. A meta-analysis of the BVD from the assessed studies utilised weightings based upon BIVAC grades and the width of the data confidence intervals to generate global BVD estimates.
Results
BIVAC assessment of 47 publications delivered 1 A, 3 B, 39C and 4 D gradings. Publications relating to adiponectin, C-peptide, IGF-1, IGFBP-3, lactate and pyruvate were all assessed as grade C. Meta-analysis enabled global BV estimates for all analytes except pyruvate, lactate and fructosamine.
Conclusions
This study delivers updated and evidence-based BV estimates for diabetes-related analytes. There remains a need for delivery of new high-quality BV studies for several clinically important analytes.},

  abstract      = {Magnetoreception, the perception of the geomagnetic field, is a sensory modality well-established across all major groups of vertebrates and some invertebrates, but its presence in humans has been tested rarely, yielding inconclusive results. We report here a strong, specific human brain response to ecologically-relevant rotations of Earth-strength magnetic fields. Following geomagnetic stimulation, a drop in amplitude of EEG alpha oscillations (8-13 Hz) occurred in a repeatable manner. Termed alpha event-related desynchronization (alpha-ERD), such a response has been associated previously with sensory and cognitive processing of external stimuli including vision, auditory and somatosensory cues. Alpha-ERD in response to the geomagnetic field was triggered only by horizontal rotations when the static vertical magnetic field was directed downwards, as it is in the Northern Hemisphere; no brain responses were elicited by the same horizontal rotations when the static vertical component was directed upwards. This implicates a biological response tuned to the ecology of the local human population, rather than a generic physical effect.Biophysical tests showed that the neural response was sensitive to static components of the magnetic field. This rules out all forms of electrical induction (including artifacts from the electrodes) which are determined solely on dynamic components of the field. The neural response was also sensitive to the polarity of the magnetic field. This rules out free-radical {\textquoteright}quantum compass{\textquoteright} mechanisms like the cryptochrome hypothesis, which can detect only axial alignment. Ferromagnetism remains a viable biophysical mechanism for sensory transduction and provides a basis to start the behavioral exploration of human magnetoreception.Significance Statement Although many migrating and homing animals are sensitive to Earth{\textquoteright}s magnetic field, most humans are not consciously aware of the geomagnetic stimuli that we encounter in everyday life. Either we have lost a shared, ancestral magnetosensory system, or the system lacks a conscious component with detectable neural activity but no apparent perceptual awareness by us. We found two classes of ecologically-relevant rotations of Earth-strength magnetic fields that produce strong, specific and repeatable effects on human brainwave activity in the EEG alpha band (8-13 Hz); EEG discriminates in response to different geomagnetic field stimuli. Biophysical tests rule out all except the presence of a ferromagnetic transduction element, such as biologically-precipitated crystals of magnetite (Fe3O4).},

  abstract      = {The term âlearning stylesâ refers to the concept that individuals differ in regard to what mode of instruction or study is most effective for them. Proponents of learning-style assessment contend that optimal instruction requires diagnosing individuals' learning style and tailoring instruction accordingly. Assessments of learning style typically ask people to evaluate what sort of information presentation they prefer (e.g., words versus pictures versus speech) and/or what kind of mental activity they find most engaging or congenial (e.g., analysis versus listening), although assessment instruments are extremely diverse. The most commonâbut not the onlyâhypothesis about the instructional relevance of learning styles is the meshing hypothesis, according to which instruction is best provided in a format that matches the preferences of the learner (e.g., for a âvisual learner,â emphasizing visual presentation of information).The learning-styles view has acquired great influence within the education field, and is frequently encountered at levels ranging from kindergarten to graduate school. There is a thriving industry devoted to publishing learning-styles tests and guidebooks for teachers, and many organizations offer professional development workshops for teachers and educators built around the concept of learning styles.The authors of the present review were charged with determining whether these practices are supported by scientific evidence. We concluded that any credible validation of learning-styles-based instruction requires robust documentation of a very particular type of experimental finding with several necessary criteria. First, students must be divided into groups on the basis of their learning styles, and then students from each group must be randomly assigned to receive one of multiple instructional methods. Next, students must then sit for a final test that is the same for all students. Finally, in order to demonstrate that optimal learning requires that students receive instruction tailored to their putative learning style, the experiment must reveal a specific type of interaction between learning style and instructional method: Students with one learning style achieve the best educational outcome when given an instructional method that differs from the instructional method producing the best outcome for students with a different learning style. In other words, the instructional method that proves most effective for students with one learning style is not the most effective method for students with a different learning style.Our review of the literature disclosed ample evidence that children and adults will, if asked, express preferences about how they prefer information to be presented to them. There is also plentiful evidence arguing that people differ in the degree to which they have some fairly specific aptitudes for different kinds of thinking and for processing different types of information. However, we found virtually no evidence for the interaction pattern mentioned above, which was judged to be a precondition for validating the educational applications of learning styles. Although the literature on learning styles is enormous, very few studies have even used an experimental methodology capable of testing the validity of learning styles applied to education. Moreover, of those that did use an appropriate method, several found results that flatly contradict the popular meshing hypothesis.We conclude therefore, that at present, there is no adequate evidence base to justify incorporating learning-styles assessments into general educational practice. Thus, limited education resources would better be devoted to adopting other educational practices that have a strong evidence base, of which there are an increasing number. However, given the lack of methodologically sound studies of learning styles, it would be an error to conclude that all possible versions of learning styles have been tested and found wanting; many have simply not been tested at all. Further research on the use of learning-styles assessment in instruction may in some cases be warranted, but such research needs to be performed appropriately.},

In light of cognitive psychology theory on costs associated with multitasking, we examined the effects of in-class laptop use on student learning in a simulated classroom. We found that participants who multitasked on a laptop during a lecture scored lower on a test compared to those who did not multitask, and participants who were in direct view of a multitasking peer scored lower on a test compared to those who were not. The results demonstrate that multitasking on a laptop poses a significant distraction to both users and fellow students and can be detrimental to comprehension of lecture content.},

With this in mind we searched for signs of magnetic alignment in dogs. We measured the direction of the body axis in 70 dogs of 37 breeds during defecation (1,893 observations) and urination (5,582 observations) over a two-year period. After complete sampling, we sorted the data according to the geomagnetic conditions prevailing during the respective sampling periods. Relative declination and intensity changes of the MF during the respective dog walks were calculated from daily magnetograms.

We developed a conceptual framework to identify globally important islands for invasive mammal eradications to prevent imminent extinctions of highly threatened species using biogeographic and technical factors, plus a novel approach to consider socio-political feasibility. We applied this framework using a comprehensive dataset describing the distribution of 1,184 highly threatened native vertebrate species (i.e. those listed as Critically Endangered or Endangered on the IUCN Red List) and 184 non-native mammals on 1,279 islands worldwide. Based on extinction risk, irreplaceability, severity of impact from invasive species, and technical feasibility of eradication, we identified and ranked 292 of the most important islands where eradicating invasive mammals would benefit highly threatened vertebrates. When socio-political feasibility was considered, we identified 169 of these islands where eradication planning or operation could be initiated by 2020 or 2030 and would improve the survival prospects of 9.4% of the Earth’s most highly threatened terrestrial insular vertebrates (111 of 1,184 species). Of these, 107 islands were in 34 countries and territories and could have eradication projects initiated by 2020. Concentrating efforts to eradicate invasive mammals on these 107 islands would benefit 151 populations of 80 highly threatened vertebrates and make a major contribution towards achieving global conservation targets adopted by the world’s nations.},

Herbicides were the main contributor to the total amount of pesticides found in the samples, with terbuthylazine present in all the samples. The maximum individual concentration recorded was of dimethenamid at 59.85 μg L−1. The maximum combined pesticide concentration was found in a sample from the Wulfdambeek canal, Belgium, with 94.02 μg L−1 comprised of a mixture of 70 different pesticides. European regulatory standards defining acceptable concentration levels were exceeded for at least one pesticide in 13 of the 29 samples analysed, with the neonicotinoid insecticides imidacloprid and clothianidin most frequently present above such limits. The majority of the veterinary drugs detected were antimicrobials, most being antibiotics. The β-lactam antibiotic dicloxacillin was present in two thirds of the analysed samples. The application of this consistent research approach across Europe allowed the identification of a significant threat to the aquatic environment associated with pesticide contamination, and in some cases veterinary drugs, at the time of sampling in the water bodies tested.},

  abstract      = {CHC22 clathrin plays a key role in intracellular membrane traffic of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter GLUT4 in humans. We performed population genetic and phylogenetic analyses of the CHC22-encoding \textit{CLTCL1} gene, revealing independent gene loss in at least two vertebrate lineages, after arising from gene duplication. All vertebrates retained the paralogous \textit{CLTC} gene encoding CHC17 clathrin, which mediates endocytosis. For vertebrates retaining \textit{CLTCL1}, strong evidence for purifying selection supports CHC22 functionality. All human populations maintained two high frequency \textit{CLTCL1} allelic variants, encoding either methionine or valine at position 1316. Functional studies indicated that CHC22-V1316, which is more frequent in farming populations than in hunter-gatherers, has different cellular dynamics than M1316-CHC22 and is less effective at controlling GLUT4 membrane traffic, altering its insulin-regulated response. These analyses suggest that ancestral human dietary change influenced selection of allotypes that affect CHC22’s role in metabolism and have potential to differentially influence the human insulin response.},

  abstract      = {Helmets are one of the earliest and most enduring methods of personal protection in human civilization. Although primarily developed for combat purposes in ancient times, modern helmets have become highly diversified to sports, recreation, and transportation. History and the scientific literature exhibit that helmets continue to be the primary and most effective prevention method against traumatic brain injury (TBI), which presents high mortality and morbidity rates in the US. The neurosurgical and neurotrauma literature on helmets and TBI indicate that helmets provide effectual protection against moderate to severe head trauma resulting in severe disability or death. However, there is a dearth of scientific data on helmet efficacy against concussion in both civilian and military aspects. The objective of this literature review was to explore the historical evolution of helmets, consider the effectiveness of helmets in protecting against severe intracranial injuries, and examine recent evidence on helmet efficacy against concussion. It was also the goal of this report to emphasize the need for more research on helmet efficacy with improved experimental design and quantitative standardization of assessments for concussion and TBI, and to promote expanded involvement of neurosurgery in studying the quantitative diagnostics of concussion and TBI. Recent evidence summarized by this literature review suggests that helmeted patients do not have better relative clinical outcome and protection against concussion than unhelmeted patients.

  abstract      = {BACKGROUND
Higher levels of sodium intake are reported to be associated with higher blood pressure. Whether this relationship varies according to levels of sodium or potassium intake and in different populations is unknown.

METHODS
We studied 102,216 adults from 18 countries. Estimates of 24-hour sodium and potassium excretion were made from a single fasting morning urine specimen and were used as surrogates for intake. We assessed the relationship between electrolyte excretion and blood pressure, as measured with an automated device.

RESULTS
Regression analyses showed increments of 2.11 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure and 0.78 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure for each 1-g increment in estimated sodium excretion. The slope of this association was steeper with higher sodium intake (an increment of 2.58 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure per gram for sodium excretion >5 g per day, 1.74 mm Hg per gram for 3 to 5 g per day, and 0.74 mm Hg per gram for <3 g per day; P<0.001 for interaction). The slope of association was steeper for persons with hypertension (2.49 mm Hg per gram) than for those without hypertension (1.30 mm Hg per gram, P<0.001 for interaction) and was steeper with increased age (2.97 mm Hg per gram at >55 years of age, 2.43 mm Hg per gram at 45 to 55 years of age, and 1.96 mm Hg per gram at <45 years of age; P<0.001 for interaction). Potassium excretion was inversely associated with systolic blood pressure, with a steeper slope of association for persons with hypertension than for those without it (P<0.001) and a steeper slope with increased age (P<0.001).

CONCLUSIONS
In this study, the association of estimated intake of sodium and potassium, as determined from measurements of excretion of these cations, with blood pressure was nonlinear and was most pronounced in persons consuming high-sodium diets, persons with hypertension, and older persons.

The optimal range of sodium intake for cardiovascular health is controversial.

METHODS
We obtained morning fasting urine samples from 101,945 persons in 17 countries and estimated 24-hour sodium and potassium excretion (used as a surrogate for intake). We examined the association between estimated urinary sodium and potassium excretion and the composite outcome of death and major cardiovascular events.

RESULTS
The mean estimated sodium and potassium excretion was 4.93 g per day and 2.12 g per day, respectively. With a mean follow-up of 3.7 years, the composite outcome occurred in 3317 participants (3.3%). As compared with an estimated sodium excretion of 4.00 to 5.99 g per day (reference range), a higher estimated sodium excretion (≥7.00 g per day) was associated with an increased risk of the composite outcome (odds ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 1.30), as well as increased risks of death and major cardiovascular events considered separately. The association between a high estimated sodium excretion and the composite outcome was strongest among participants with hypertension (P=0.02 for interaction), with an increased risk at an estimated sodium excretion of 6.00 g or more per day. As compared with the reference range, an estimated sodium excretion that was below 3.00 g per day was also associated with an increased risk of the composite outcome (odds ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.44). As compared with an estimated potassium excretion that was less than 1.50 g per day, higher potassium excretion was associated with a reduced risk of the composite outcome.

CONCLUSIONS
In this study in which sodium intake was estimated on the basis of measured urinary excretion, an estimated sodium intake between 3 g per day and 6 g per day was associated with a lower risk of death and cardiovascular events than was either a higher or lower estimated level of intake. As compared with an estimated potassium excretion that was less than 1.50 g per day, higher potassium excretion was associated with a lower risk of death and cardiovascular events.

High sodium intake increases blood pressure, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, but the effects of sodium intake on global cardiovascular mortality are uncertain.

METHODS
We collected data from surveys on sodium intake as determined by urinary excretion and diet in persons from 66 countries (accounting for 74.1% of adults throughout the world), and we used these data to quantify the global consumption of sodium according to age, sex, and country. The effects of sodium on blood pressure, according to age, race, and the presence or absence of hypertension, were calculated from data in a new meta-analysis of 107 randomized interventions, and the effects of blood pressure on cardiovascular mortality, according to age, were calculated from a meta-analysis of cohorts. Cause-specific mortality was derived from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010. Using comparative risk assessment, we estimated the cardiovascular effects of current sodium intake, as compared with a reference intake of 2.0 g of sodium per day, according to age, sex, and country.

RESULTS
In 2010, the estimated mean level of global sodium consumption was 3.95 g per day, and regional mean levels ranged from 2.18 to 5.51 g per day. Globally, 1.65 million annual deaths from cardiovascular causes (95% uncertainty interval [confidence interval], 1.10 million to 2.22 million) were attributed to sodium intake above the reference level; 61.9% of these deaths occurred in men and 38.1% occurred in women. These deaths accounted for nearly 1 of every 10 deaths from cardiovascular causes (9.5%). Four of every 5 deaths (84.3%) occurred in low- and middle-income countries, and 2 of every 5 deaths (40.4%) were premature (before 70 years of age). The rate of death from cardiovascular causes associated with sodium intake above the reference level was highest in the country of Georgia and lowest in Kenya.

CONCLUSIONS
In this modeling study, 1.65 million deaths from cardiovascular causes that occurred in 2010 were attributed to sodium consumption above a reference level of 2.0 g per day. (Funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.)},

  year          = {2017},
  __markedentry = {[pale:6]},
  abstract      = {Ohälsosamma matvanor är en av de största riskfaktorerna för ohälsa och för tidig
död i Sverige, och av de tio främsta riskfaktorerna är hälften relaterade till
matvanor och fysisk aktivitet. Sedan 1980 har förekomsten av fetma tredubblats
hos vuxna och i dag är varannan svensk överviktig eller fet. Ohälsosamma
matvanor, otillräcklig fysisk aktivitet och de relaterade folksjukdomarna är
vanligare i grupper med lägre utbildning och inkomst. Ohälsan orsakar även
kostnader både för samhället och för individen, och enbart fetma uppskattas kosta
samhället ca 70 miljarder kronor per år. Det behövs insatser för att främja hälsa och
livskvalitet och för att minska samhällets hälso- och sjukvårdskostnader. Sådana
insatser är även en förutsättning för att nå hållbarhetsmålen i Agenda 2030.
Folkhälsomyndigheten och Livsmedelsverket har på regeringens uppdrag tagit
fram underlag och förslag till åtgärder för att främja hälsa som är relaterad till
matvanor och fysisk aktivitet. Underlagen och åtgärdsförslagen bygger på
kunskapssammanställningar, en aktörskartläggning, dialogmöten, en undersökning
av möjligheterna till frivilliga åtaganden inom livsmedelskedjan och en utredning
av utökad uppföljning på området. Arbetet har avgränsats till hälsofrämjande och
förebyggande insatser i den friska befolkningen.
Det är möjligt att främja hälsosamma matvanor och fysisk aktivitet på befolkningsnivå, men insatserna behöver vara långsiktiga och riktas både till individer och till
deras sociala och fysiska miljö. Viktiga aktörer och samhällsstrukturer i ett sådant
arbete är skola och förskola, arbetsplatser, hälso- och sjukvården, närområdet,
föreningslivet, livsmedelskedjan och omsorgen. Det pågår en rad aktiviteter för att
främja hälsosamma matvanor och fysisk aktivitet inom offentlig, privat och ideell
sektor i Sverige, men de räcker inte för att vända utvecklingen och minska de
framtida samhällskostnaderna. De berörda aktörerna efterfrågar ett mer
sammanhållet nationellt arbete med mat och fysisk aktivitet så att de får bättre
möjligheter att prioritera frågorna i verksamheten och att arbeta mer samordnat.
Myndigheternas förslag beskriver en övergripande struktur på nationell nivå som
kan öka förutsättningarna för andra aktörer i samhället att medverka i ett långsiktigt
hälsofrämjande arbete kring mat och fysisk aktivitet.
Myndigheterna anser att det behövs en nationell målstyrning för att minska ohälsan
i alla grupper och minska skillnaderna i hälsa, som är relaterade till matvanor och
fysisk aktivitet. Denna målstyrning behöver beaktas i alla politikområden.
Nationella mål ger förutsättningar för ett långsiktigt arbete, en effektiv samverkan
mellan olika aktörer och för att olika insatser ska förstärka och komplettera
varandra. En gemensam målbild på nationell nivå skulle också ge incitament för
mobilisering och samordning även på regional och lokal nivå. 
4
Folkhälsomyndigheten bör få i uppdrag att skapa en struktur för nationell
samordning av folkhälsoarbetet som är relaterat till matvanor och fysisk aktivitet.
Arbetet kan ske genom en myndighetssamverkansgrupp på nationell nivå och en
intressentgrupp med representanter för bl.a. ideella organisationer,
professionsföreningar, forskningslärosäten, näringslivet och arbetsmarknaden. En
samordningsstruktur kan möjliggöra systematiska och samordnade insatser på
nationell, regional och lokal nivå, som bygger på en nationell målstruktur. Det
skulle även underlätta Regeringskansliets arbete med att samordna uppdrag eller
göra särskilda insatser rörande matvanor och fysisk aktivitet.
De berörda nationella myndigheterna bör, inom sina respektive ansvarsområden,
verka för ett kunskapsbaserat hälsofrämjande arbete på lokal, regional och nationell
nivå. Arbetet bör omfatta behovsanalyser, kunskapsstöd, uppföljningar av
användning och resultat samt utvärderingar av hälsofrämjande insatser. Det
förebyggande och hälsofrämjande arbetet med matvanor och fysisk aktivitet bör
integreras i en bred hälsofrämjande ansats, och kunskap och erfarenhet behöver tas
tillvara och användas av de aktörer som ansvarar för att implementera kunskapen.
Professionen behöver rätt grundutbildning och fortbildningsmöjligheter. Därför är
det viktigt att undersöka om pedagogiska utbildningar och hälso- och
sjukvårdsutbildningar kan stärkas när det gäller förebyggande och hälsofrämjande
arbete som är kopplat till matvanor och fysisk aktivitet. Dessutom behövs en
översyn av vad som krävs för att huvudmän ska kunna verka för ett effektivt
kunskapsbaserat förebyggande arbete på området matvanor och fysisk aktivitet.
Offentliga styrmedel kan användas för att främja förutsättningarna för hälsosamma
matvanor och fysisk aktivitet, till exempel lagar, regelverk, riktade statsbidrag,
skatter, subventioner och avdragsmöjligheter. Vi föreslår en utredning av hur
sådana styrmedel kan användas effektivt, och två angelägna områden är ekonomiska styrmedel på livsmedelsområdet samt begränsning av marknadsföring till
barn när det gäller ohälsosam mat. Båda är exempel på strukturella åtgärder som
syftar till att göra de hälsosamma valen naturliga och enkla för alla i samhället.
Det höga saltintaget står för en stor andel av sjukdomsbördan och de största
källorna är vanliga livsmedel såsom kött- och charkprodukter, bröd och hel- och
halvfabrikat. Därför behövs ett långsiktigt, nationellt program för att gradvis sänka
salthalten i livsmedel generellt. Ett sådant program kan bygga på koordinerade
frivilliga insatser från livsmedelsföretag eller reglering av saltinnehåll i livsmedel.
Programmet bör kontinuerligt följas upp.
Folkhälsomyndigheten bör få i uppdrag att i samverkan med andra nationella
aktörer utveckla uppföljningen och analysen av det främjande och förebyggande
arbetet inom matvanor och fysisk aktivitet. Det förutsätter fördjupade analyser av
individdata, vilket i stor utsträckning kräver att Folkhälsomyndigheten blir officiell
statistikmyndighet. Det utvecklingsarbete som behövs bör i så stor utsträckning
som möjligt integreras eller samordnas med övrigt utvecklingsarbete inom
folkhälsoområdet. 
5
Det är viktigt att uppföljningen bygger på målstyrning och beslutade nationella mål
eftersom det ger en långsiktighet i arbetet, och ett bättre stöd för prioriteringar på
såväl nationell som regional och lokal nivå.},

  abstract      = {How does a lack of sleep affect our brains? In contrast to the benefits of sleep, frameworks exploring the impact of sleep loss are relatively lacking. Importantly, the effects of sleep deprivation (SD) do not simply reflect the absence of sleep and the benefits attributed to it; rather, they reflect the consequences of several additional factors, including extended wakefulness. With a focus on neuroimaging studies, we review the consequences of SD on attention and working memory, positive and negative emotion, and hippocampal learning. We explore how this evidence informs our mechanistic understanding of the known changes in cognition and emotion associated with SD, and the insights it provides regarding clinical conditions associated with sleep disruption.

Key points
Sleep deprivation triggers a set of bidirectional changes in brain activity and connectivity, depending on the specific cognitive or affective behaviours engaged.

Changes in brain activity are observed when averaged across a session of task performance and during on-task performance, wherein marked brain network instability seems to be a neural hallmark of sleep deprivation.

Not all changes in brain function that are associated with sleep loss are maladaptive and thus represent deficiencies, as some predict resilience in behavioural ability and are therefore compensatory.

These basic scientific findings offer causal mechanistic insights into select neurological and psychiatric disorders in which abnormalities in sleep and cognition or emotion are highly comorbid, indicating that sleep intervention is an underappreciated and novel target for disease treatment and/or prevention.

The robust neural and behavioural phenotypes characterized by this Review can inform debates regarding sleep recommendations for both public and professional health policies, especially in light of the escalating sleep-loss epidemic prevalent throughout industrialized nations.},

  abstract      = {Much of the current science on, and mathematical modeling of, dynamic changes in human performance within and between days is dominated by the two-process model of sleep–wake regulation, which posits a neurobiological drive for sleep that varies homeostatically (increasing as a saturating exponential during wakefulness and decreasing in a like manner during sleep), and a circadian process that neurobiologically modulates both the homeostatic drive for sleep and waking alertness and performance. Endogenous circadian rhythms in neurobehavioral functions, including physiological alertness and cognitive performance, have been demonstrated using special laboratory protocols that reveal the interaction of the biological clock with the sleep homeostatic drive. Individual differences in circadian rhythms and genetic and other components underlying such differences also influence waking neurobehavioral functions. Both acute total sleep deprivation and chronic sleep restriction increase homeostatic sleep drive and degrade waking neurobehavioral functions as reflected in sleepiness, attention, cognitive speed, and memory. Recent evidence indicating a high degree of stability in neurobehavioral responses to sleep loss suggests that these trait-like individual differences are phenotypic and likely involve genetic components, including circadian genes. Recent experiments have revealed both sleep homeostatic and circadian effects on brain metabolism and neural activation. Investigation of the neural and genetic mechanisms underlying the dynamically complex interaction between sleep homeostasis and circadian systems is beginning. A key goal of this work is to identify biomarkers that accurately predict human performance in situations in which the circadian and sleep homeostatic systems are perturbed.},

Consistently, rodent models carrying mutations in clock genes also demonstrate similar phenotypes. Taken together, these studies suggest that human clock-gene variants contribute to the phenotypic differences observed in various behavioral and physiological processes, although to validate this requires further characterization of the molecular consequences of these polymorphisms.

  abstract      = {Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is an effective treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). During EMDR, patients make eye movements (EMs) while recalling traumatic memories, but recently therapists have replaced EMs by alternating beep tones. There are no outcome studies on the effects of tones. In an earlier analogue study, tones were inferior to EMs in the reduction of vividness of aversive memories. In a first EMDR session, 12 PTSD patients recalled trauma memories in three conditions: recall only, recall + tones, and recall + EMs. Three competing hypotheses were tested: 1) EMs are as effective as tones and better than recall only, 2) EMs are better than tones and tones are as effective as recall only, and 3) EMs are better than tones and tones are better than recall only. The order of conditions was balanced, each condition was delivered twice, and decline in memory vividness and emotionality served as outcome measures. The data strongly support hypothesis 2 and 3 over 1: EMs outperformed tones while it remained unclear if tones add to recall only. The findings add to earlier considerations and earlier analogue findings suggesting that EMs are superior to tones and that replacing the former by the latter was premature.},

  abstract      = {Conspiratorial ideation is the tendency of individuals to believe that events and power relations are secretly manipulated by certain clandestine groups and organisations. Many of these ostensibly explanatory conjectures are non-falsifiable, lacking in evidence or demonstrably false, yet public acceptance remains high. Efforts to convince the general public of the validity of medical and scientific findings can be hampered by such narratives, which can create the impression of doubt or disagreement in areas where the science is well established. Conversely, historical examples of exposed conspiracies do exist and it may be difficult for people to differentiate between reasonable and dubious assertions. In this work, we establish a simple mathematical model for conspiracies involving multiple actors with time, which yields failure probability for any given conspiracy. Parameters for the model are estimated from literature examples of known scandals, and the factors influencing conspiracy success and failure are explored. The model is also used to estimate the likelihood of claims from some commonly-held conspiratorial beliefs; these are namely that the moon-landings were faked, climate-change is a hoax, vaccination is dangerous and that a cure for cancer is being suppressed by vested interests. Simulations of these claims predict that intrinsic failure would be imminent even with the most generous estimates for the secret-keeping ability of active participants—the results of this model suggest that large conspiracies (≥1000 agents) quickly become untenable and prone to failure. The theory presented here might be useful in counteracting the potentially deleterious consequences of bogus and anti-science narratives, and examining the hypothetical conditions under which sustainable conspiracy might be possible.},

  abstract      = {Neuroimaging studies suggest differences in the underlying biology of sexual arousal associated with sex and sexual orientation, yet their findings are conflicting. Following a thorough statistical review of all significant neuroimaging studies, we offer strong quantitative evidence that the neuronal response to visual sexual stimuli, contrary to the widely accepted view, is independent of biological sex. Both men and women show increased activation in many cortical and subcortical brain regions thought to be involved in the response to visual sexual stimuli, while the limited sex differences that have been found and reported previously refer to subjective rating of the content.Sexual arousal is a dynamical, highly coordinated neurophysiological process that is often induced by visual stimuli. Numerous studies have proposed that the cognitive processing stage of responding to sexual stimuli is the first stage, in which sex differences occur, and the divergence between men and women has been attributed to differences in the concerted activity of neural networks. The present comprehensive metaanalysis challenges this hypothesis and provides robust quantitative evidence that the neuronal circuitries activated by visual sexual stimuli are independent of biological sex. Sixty-one functional magnetic resonance imaging studies (1,850 individuals) that presented erotic visual stimuli to men and women of different sexual orientation were identified. Coordinate-based activation likelihood estimation was used to conduct metaanalyses. Sensitivity and clustering analyses of averaged neuronal response patterns were performed to investigate robustness of the findings. In contrast to neutral stimuli, sexual pictures and videos induce significant activations in brain regions, including insula, middle occipital, anterior cingulate and fusiform gyrus, amygdala, striatum, pulvinar, and substantia nigra. Cluster analysis suggests stimulus type as the most, and biological sex as the least, predictor for classification. Contrast analysis further shows no significant sex-specific differences within groups. Systematic review of sex differences in gray matter volume of brain regions associated with sexual arousal (3,723 adults) did not show any causal relationship between structural features and functional response to visual sexual stimuli. The neural basis of sexual arousal in humans is associated with sexual orientation yet, contrary to the widely accepted view, is not different between women and men.},

The control group comprised age, body mass and height matched men using mixed diets (MDs). The diets used were registered for 7 days and analyzed in terms of the energy, carbohydrate, fat and protein contents. It was found that the diets used were isoenergetic, yet varied considerably in carbohydrate and fat content. The LCDs significantly intensified the ketogenesis process, increased resting blood total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and heart rate, (HR) and decreased respiratory exchange ratio (RER) in relation to MD subjects. An exercise trial revealed significant impairment of exercise in subjects following the LCDs. The results showed that in the case where the subjects of two investigated groups did not differ in their somatic variables, long-term adherence to the LCDs was associated with substantially reduced exercise performance in apparently healthy subjects, along with an association with a small unfavorable effect on their lipid profile.},

Their cardiovascular responses were compared with those of 10 physically healthy controls (males) who were individually matched by VO2 peak values. Fasting had no significant effect on the central (heart rate, HR; stroke volume, SV; cardiac output, Q) and peripheral (arteriovenous oxygen content difference, a‐vO2 diff.) components of VO2 during submaximal exercise. The respiratory exchange ratio (RER) during submaximal exercise was significantly decreased in the fasted subjects. Based on the RER, fasting altered substrate utilization of the muscle and thereby increased the contribution of fat during submaximal exercise. Fasting had no significant effect on VO2 peak, HR or O2 pulse, but RER was significantly lower during incremental exercise to fatigue. These results demonstrate that VO2 during submaximal exercise in fasted subjects is achieved by similar central and peripheral responses as found in non‐fasted subjects, and that fasting does not reduce VO2 peak. },

  abstract      = {Abstract Forestry with short stand generations and simplified forest structures has markedly affected forest biodiversity. One group of organisms adversely affected by clear-cutting is ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, as they are associated with the roots of living trees. Retention forestry is a way of reducing logging impacts and enhancing biodiversity conservation. Increasing the proportion of trees retained at harvest may improve ECM fungal diversity. We investigated the potential for lifeboating of ECM fungi through the harvesting phase in an experimental field study in a 190-year-old Scots pine forest in northern Sweden. The experiment comprised four levels of tree retention—unlogged forest, plots with 60\% or 30\% of evenly distributed trees retained and clear-cuts without retained trees. We sampled soils and determined identities, frequencies and relative abundances of ECM fungal species during 3 years following logging through the use of high-throughput sequencing of amplified ITS2 markers. We identified 149 ECM fungal species, with the five most abundant species accounting for 50\% of the total ECM fungal amplicons. Three years after harvesting, the proportion of ECM sequences in the total amplicon pool had decreased proportionally to the extent of tree removal. In clear-cuts, ECM fungal relative abundance had decreased by 95\%, while ECM fungal species richness had declined by 75\%, compared to unlogged plots. Tree retention enabled the maintenance of the most frequent ECM species, while more lowly abundant species were progressively lost at random with increasing level of tree removal. Five of the most frequent ECM fungal species remained present after clear-cutting, probably associated with pine seedlings. Synthesis and applications. Tree retention can moderate short-term and potentially also long-term logging impacts on ECM fungi. Local ECM fungal diversity is preserved in proportion to the amount of retained trees. Abundant species may be largely maintained, even by low levels of tree retention and on naturally established seedlings. However, conservation of more infrequent species requires higher levels of tree retention, and our results suggest that around 75\% of the ECM species are lost with the forest certification standard of 5\% retention trees left at logging.},

  abstract      = {The role of glycogen in the central nervous system is intimately linked with the glycolytic pathway. Glycogen is synthesized from glucose, the primary substrate for glycolysis, and degraded to glucose-6-phosphate. The metabolic cost of shunting glucose via glycogen exceeds that of simple phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate by hexokinase; thus, there must be a metabolic advantage in utilizing this shunt pathway. The dogmatic view of glycogen as a storage depot persists, based on initial descriptions of glycogen supporting neural function in the face of aglycemia. The variable latency to conduction failure, dependent upon tissue glycogen levels, provided convincing evidence of the role played by glycogen in supporting neural function. Glycogen is located predominantly in astrocytes in the central nervous system, thus for glycogen to benefit neural elements, intercellular metabolic communication must exist in the form of astrocyte to neuron substrate transfer. Experimental evidence supports a model where glycogen is metabolized to lactate in astrocytes, with cellular expression of monocarboxylate transporters and enzymes appropriately located for lactate shuttling between astrocytes and neural elements, where lactate acts as a substrate for oxidative metabolism. Biosensor recordings have demonstrated a significant steady concentration of lactate present on the periphery of both central white matter and peripheral nerve under unstimulated baseline conditions, indicating continuous cellular efflux of lactate to the interstitium. The existence of this lactate pool argues we must reexamine the ‘on demand’ shuttling of lactate between cellular elements, and suggests continuous lactate efflux surplus to immediate neural requirements.},

  abstract      = {Lactate, the conjugate base of lactic acid occurring in aqueous biological fluids, has been derided as a “dead-end” waste product of anaerobic metabolism. Catalyzed by the near-equilibrium enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), the reduction of pyruvate to lactate is thought to serve to regenerate the NAD+ necessary for continued glycolytic flux. Reaction kinetics for LDH imply that lactate oxidation is rarely favored in the tissues of its own production. However, a substantial body of research directly contradicts any notion that LDH invariably operates unidirectionally in vivo. In the current Perspective, a model is forwarded in which the continuous formation and oxidation of lactate serves as a mitochondrial electron shuttle, whereby lactate generated in the cytosol of the cell is oxidized at the mitochondria of the same cell. From this perspective, an intracellular lactate shuttle operates much like the malate-aspartate shuttle; it is also proposed that the two shuttles are necessarily interconnected. Among the requisite features of such a model, significant compartmentalization of LDH, much like the creatine kinase of the PCr shuttle, would facilitate net cellular lactate oxidation under a variety of conditions.},

  abstract      = {Through much of the history of metabolism, lactate (La-) has been considered merely a deadend waste product during periods of dysoxia.  Congruently, the end product of glycolysis has been viewed dichotomously: pyruvate in the presence of adequate oxygenation, La- in the absence of adequate oxygenation.  In contrast, given the near-equilibrium nature of the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) reaction and that LDH has a much higher activity than the putative regulatory enzymes of the glycolytic and oxidative pathways, we contend that La- is always the end product of glycolysis. Cellular La- accumulation, as opposed to flux, is dependent on 1) the rate of glycolysis, 2) oxidative enzyme activity, 3) cellular O2 level, and 4) the net rate of La- transport into (influx) or out of (efflux) the cell.  For intracellular metabolism, we reintroduce the Cytosol-to-Mitochondria Lactate Shuttle.  Our proposition, analogous to the phosphocreatine shuttle, purports that pyruvate, NAD+, NADH, and La- are held uniformly near equilibrium throughout the cell cytosol due to the high activity of LDH.  La- is always the end product of glycolysis and represents the primary diffusing species capable of spatially linking glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation.},

  abstract      = { The concentration of the protein S100B in serum is used as a brain damage marker in various conditions. We wanted to investigate whether a voluntary, prolonged apnea in trained breath-hold divers resulted in an increase of S100B in serum. Nine trained breath-hold divers performed a protocol mimicking the procedures they use during breath-hold training and competition, including extensive preapneic hyperventilation and glossopharyngeal insufflation, in order to perform a maximum-duration apnea, i.e., “static apnea” (average: 335 s, range: 281–403 s). Arterial blood samples were collected and cardiovascular variables recorded. Arterial partial pressures of O2 and CO2 (PaO2 and PaCO2) were 128 Torr and 20 Torr, respectively, at the start of apnea. The degree of asphyxia at the end of apnea was considerable, with PaO2 and PaCO2 reaching 28 Torr and 45 Torr, respectively. The concentration of S100B in serum transiently increased from 0.066 μg/l at the start of apnea to 0.083 μg/l after the apnea (P < 0.05). The increase in S100B is attributed to the asphyxia or to other physiological responses to apnea, for example, increased blood pressure, and probably indicates a temporary opening of the blood-brain barrier. It is not possible to conclude that the observed increase in S100B levels in serum after a maximal-duration apnea reflects a serious injury to the brain, although the results raise concerns considering negative long-term effects. At the least, the results indicate that prolonged, voluntary apnea affects the integrity of the central nervous system and do not preclude cumulative effects. },

  abstract      = {In the human body, glycogen is a branched polymer of glucose stored mainly in the liver and the skeletal muscle that supplies glucose to the blood stream during fasting periods and to the muscle cells during muscle contraction. Glycogen has been identified in other tissues such as brain, heart, kidney, adipose tissue, and erythrocytes, but glycogen function in these tissues is mostly unknown. Glycogen synthesis requires a series of reactions that include glucose entrance into the cell through transporters, phosphorylation of glucose to glucose 6-phosphate, isomerization to glucose 1-phosphate, and formation of uridine 5'-diphosphate-glucose, which is the direct glucose donor for glycogen synthesis. Glycogenin catalyzes the formation of a short glucose polymer that is extended by the action of glycogen synthase. Glycogen branching enzyme introduces branch points in the glycogen particle at even intervals. Laforin and malin are proteins involved in glycogen assembly but their specific function remains elusive in humans. Glycogen is accumulated in the liver primarily during the postprandial period and in the skeletal muscle predominantly after exercise. In the cytosol, glycogen breakdown or glycogenolysis is carried out by two enzymes, glycogen phosphorylase which releases glucose 1-phosphate from the linear chains of glycogen, and glycogen debranching enzyme which untangles the branch points. In the lysosomes, glycogen degradation is catalyzed by α-glucosidase. The glucose 6-phosphatase system catalyzes the dephosphorylation of glucose 6-phosphate to glucose, a necessary step for free glucose to leave the cell. Mutations in the genes encoding the enzymes involved in glycogen metabolism cause glycogen storage diseases.},

The body has a remarkable capacity to satisfy the nutritional need for glucose, while still maintaining blood glucose homeostasis. The essential role of glucagon and insulin and the importance of distributed control of glucose fluxes are highlighted in this review. With regard to the latter, studies are presented that show how regulation of muscle glucose uptake is regulated by glucose delivery to muscle, glucose transport into muscle, and glucose phosphorylation within muscle. },

Age-adjusted cut-off resulted in improved specificity with maintained sensitivity for all assays. There was a substantial decrease in false positive results, especially in the older population. Summary Background The study compares different D-dimer assays and age-adjusted cut-offs in outpatients with suspected venous thromboembolism (VTE). The plasma concentration of this sensitive biomarker is increased by activated coagulation, but also by several conditions that are linked to an increased risk of VTE. One such condition is old age, which poses a common clinical problem where many prefer not to analyze D-dimer in elderly patients. Age-adjusted cut-offs have been validated for both deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism, aiming to increase specificity without notably decreasing sensitivity. Objectives We evaluated four common D-dimer assays in parallel, with and without applying age-adjusted cut offs for VTE. Patients/methods The prospective single-center study was conducted in 940 outpatients attending the emergency department with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism or DVT. Four automated D-dimer assays were compared (Siemens INNOVANCE®, Roche Tina-quant, Medirox MRX and STA®-Liatest® D-Di PLUS). Results All assays performed with areas under the ROC curve (AUC) > 0.9 and maintained their sensitivities after implementation of age-adjusted cut-offs. Specificities increased by 6–7\% and number needed to test decreased by < 0.3. The rate of false positive results decreased by 6\% overall and by 10–20\% for patients ≥ 70. Conclusions Age-adjusted cut-offs resulted in maintained high sensitivity and a modest improvement in specificity and number needed to test for all evaluated D-dimer assays. There was a significant reduction in false positive results, which reflects avoidable unnecessary imaging without any compromise of clinical safety. This suggests a potential to benefit the management of VTE in elderly patients, both clinically and economically.},

  abstract      = { The relevance of functional brown adipose tissue (BAT) depots in human adults was undisputedly proven approximately seven years ago. Here we give an overview of all dedicated studies that were published on cold-induced BAT activity in adult humans that appeared since then. Different cooling protocols and imaging techniques to determine BAT activity are reviewed. BAT activation can be achieved by means of air- or water-cooling protocols. The most promising approach is individualized cooling, during which subjects are studied at the lowest temperature for nonshivering condition, probably revealing maximal nonshivering thermogenesis. The highest BAT prevalence (i.e., close to 100\%) is observed using the individualized cooling protocol. Currently, the most widely used technique to study the metabolic activity of BAT is deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-d-glucose ([18F]FDG)-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging. Dynamic imaging provides quantitative information about glucose uptake rates, whereas static imaging reflects overall BAT glucose uptake, localization, and distribution. In general, standardized uptake values (SUV) are used to quantify BAT activity. An accurate determination of total BAT volume is hampered by the limited spatial resolution of the PET image, leading to spillover. Different research groups use different SUV threshold values, which make it difficult to directly compare BAT activity levels between studies. Another issue is the comparison of [18F]FDG uptake in BAT with respect to other tissues or upon with baseline values. This comparison can be performed by using the “fixed volume” methodology. Finally, the potential use of other relatively noninvasive methods to quantify BAT, like magnetic resonance imaging or thermography, is discussed. },

through a historical review, an examination of ethnographic literature, fieldwork

was carried out in Sweden, the USA, and the UK. Case studies of the Saami
‘kuksa’, the ‘figure 4’ deadfall trap, and making fire by friction are used to
explore a number of themes in the contemporary bushcraft world: the role of
skilled-practice, ethical values, notions of an individually experienced
connection with nature, practice as a personal transformative experience, and as
an intersubjective relationship between practitioner and craft engagement with
the material affordances in the landscape. It is argued that motivations for
practice foreground a relationship with an environmental experience that
counters ‘alienation’ through the development of techniques required to spend
un-insulated time in nature which counter modern Western technocratic
lifestyles. Bushcraft destabilises apparently similar categories of activity,
particularly tourism, outdoor adventure recreation and education, historical reenactment and survivalism.},

The data material comprises a total of 248 hours of observations on 20 occasions and 57 interviews with 80 people.Findings- The study identifies the difference between rhetoric and practice in connection with accident work. Collaboration is seen as a rhetorical ideal rather than something that is carried out in normal practice. Asymmetry, uncertainty and lack of incentives are important explanations as to why only limited forms of collaboration are actually implemented.Research limitations/implications- The paper shows a distinction between collaboration as rhetoric and practical collaboration at accident scenes.Practical implications- The article proposes a multi‐faceted collaboration concept. In this way, collaboration can be developed and refined.Originality/value- The results of the study show that police, fire, and ambulance services want to develop excellent forms of collaboration at the accident scene, but avoid this as it leads to uncertainty and asymmetries and because of a lack of incentives. However, simpler forms of collaboration may be realistic in the organisation of everyday work at accident scenes.},

Being lost at sea is a diver’s worst nightmare. In 2006, a diver was lost at sea off the coast of New Zealand for 75 hours. It is unprecedented that, after such a long time immersed in temperate (16−17°C) waters, he was found and survived. His case is presented and utilised to illustrate the many physiological and psychological factors involved in prolonged immersion and what might determine survival under such circumstances.

The main factors in an abnormal environment are: psychological (isolation, sensory deprivation, sensory overload, sleep deprivation, temporal disorientation); psychophysiological (thermal, stress positions), and psychosocial (cultural humiliation, sexual degradation). Each single factor may not be considered tortuous, however, if deliberately structured into a systemic cluster may constitute torture under legal definition. The individual experience of extremis can be pathogenic or salutogenic and attempts are being made to capitalise on these positive experiences whilst ameliorating the more negative aspects of living in an abnormal environment.},

Events accompanying the initial impact phase of a survival incident are characterized by speed, danger, violence, and uncontrollability. The following recoil phase is known to produce behavioral and cognitive impairment that leads to a reduced ability to produce a response that is meaningful and may result in tonic immobility. The author argues that the commonly witnessed responses among survivors comprise a subset of known behaviors, including loss of initiative, stereotypy, perseveration of thought and action, hyperkinesia, hypokinesia, and, in extreme cases, akinesia or cognitive paralysis. These behaviors are characteristic of executive dysfunction and a model is given suggesting how this condition may arise under survival conditions. The case is presented that during the initial phase of a survival incident, victims show a transient, nonclinical dysexecutive syndrome. This model should aid survival training and provide a context for conducting behavioral autopsies by accident investigators.},

Those who were captured were compared with those who evaded capture. There were no differences between the evading and captured groups in age or in length of military service. However, the captured group showed significantly raised elevations on the MMPI Paranoia (Pa) and Hysteria (Hy) scales and on the EPQ Lie scale compared with the group who evaded. Previous studies have suggested that raised elevations on the Hypochondriasis, Depression, Pa, and Hy scales form a characteristic profile, which is consequent on the POW experience. The results of this study suggest that raised elevations on Pa and Hy may actually predispose an individual to capture rather than being a result of internment.},

Seven healthy men, unacclimatized to heat, were kept euhydrated or were dehydrated by controlled passive exposure to heat (H, two sessions) or by treadmill exercise (E, two sessions) up to a weight loss of 2.8%. On completion of a 1-h recovery period, the subjects drank a solution containing 50 g l−1 glucose and 1.34 g l−1 NaCl in a volume of water corresponding to 100% of his body weight loss induced by dehydration. (H1 and E1) or levels of fluid deficit were maintained (H0, E0). In the E0, H0 and control conditions, the subject drank a solution containing the same quantity of glucose diluted in 100 ml of water. Psychological tests were administered 30 min after the dehydration phase and 2 h after fluid ingestion. Both dehydration conditions impaired cognitive abilities (i.e. perceptive discrimination, short-term memory), as well as subjective estimates of fatigue, without any relevant differences between the methods. By 3.5 h after fluid deficit, dehydration (H0 and E0) no longer had any adverse effect, although the subjects felt increasingly tired. Thus, there was no beneficial effect of fluid ingestion (H1 and E1) on the cognitive variables. However, long-term memory retrieval was impaired in both control and dehydration situations, whereas there was no decrement in performance in the fluid ingestion condition (H1, E1).},

  abstract      = { Potential roles for lactate in the energetics of brain activation have changed radically during the past three decades, shifting from waste product to supplemental fuel and signaling molecule. Current models for lactate transport and metabolism involving cellular responses to excitatory neurotransmission are highly debated, owing, in part, to discordant results obtained in different experimental systems and conditions. Major conclusions drawn from tabular data summarizing results obtained in many laboratories are as follows: Glutamate-stimulated glycolysis is not an inherent property of all astrocyte cultures. Synaptosomes from the adult brain and many preparations of cultured neurons have high capacities to increase glucose transport, glycolysis, and glucose-supported respiration, and pathway rates are stimulated by glutamate and compounds that enhance metabolic demand. Lactate accumulation in activated tissue is a minor fraction of glucose metabolized and does not reflect pathway fluxes. Brain activation in subjects with low plasma lactate causes outward, brain-to-blood lactate gradients, and lactate is quickly released in substantial amounts. Lactate utilization by the adult brain increases during lactate infusions and strenuous exercise that markedly increase blood lactate levels. Lactate can be an ‘opportunistic’, glucose-sparing substrate when present in high amounts, but most evidence supports glucose as the major fuel for normal, activated brain. },

Some of these same symptoms have been reported following excess intake of caffeine. The prevalence of symptoms reported on withdrawal in different studies also covers a wide range from 11% or less to 100%. It is suggested that the evidence leads to the conclusion that non pharmacological factors related to knowledge and expectation are the prime determinants of symptoms and their reported prevalence on withdrawal of caffeine after regular consumption.},

abstract = {Abstract Drained peatlands are hotspots for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which could be mitigated by rewetting and land use change. We performed an ecological/economic analysis of rewetting drained fertile peatlands in a hemiboreal climate using different land use strategies over 80 years. Vegetation, soil processes, and total GHG emissions were modeled using the CoupModel for four scenarios: (1) business as usual—Norway spruce with average soil water table of −40 cm; (2) willow with groundwater at −20 cm; (3) reed canary grass with groundwater at −10 cm; and (4) a fully rewetted peatland. The predictions were based on previous model calibrations with several high-resolution datasets consisting of water, heat, carbon, and nitrogen cycling. Spruce growth was calibrated by tree-ring data that extended the time period covered. The GHG balance of four scenarios, including vegetation and soil, were 4.7, 7.1, 9.1, and 6.2 Mg CO2eq ha−1 year−1, respectively. The total soil emissions (including litter and peat respiration CO2 + N2O + CH4) were 33.1, 19.3, 15.3, and 11.0 Mg CO2eq ha−1 year−1, respectively, of which the peat loss contributed 35\%, 24\%, and 7\% of the soil emissions for the three drained scenarios, respectively. No peat was lost for the wet peatland. It was also found that draining increases vegetation growth, but not as drastically as peat respiration does. The cost–benefit analysis (CBA) is sensitive to time frame, discount rate, and carbon price. Our results indicate that the net benefit was greater with a somewhat higher soil water table and when the peatland was vegetated with willow and reed canary grass (Scenarios 2 and 3). We conclude that saving peat and avoiding methane release using fairly wet conditions can significantly reduce GHG emissions, and that this strategy should be considered for land use planning and policy-making.},,

 learning in the Morris water maze, however, requires multiple training trials

 determine if sleep is important for the consolidation of a single-trial,
 hippocampus-dependent task, we sleep deprived animals for 0–5 and
 5–10 h after training for contextual and cued fear conditioning. We
 found that sleep deprivation from 0–5 h after training for this task
 impaired memory consolidation for contextual fear conditioning whereas sleep
 deprivation from 5–10 h after training had no effect. Sleep deprivation
 at either time point had no effect on cued fear conditioning, a
 hippocampus-independent task. Previous studies have determined that memory
 consolidation for fear conditioning is impaired when protein kinase A and
 protein synthesis inhibitors are administered at the same time as when sleep
 deprivation is effective, suggesting that sleep deprivation may act by
 modifying these molecular mechanisms of memory storage.},

Arousal reappraisal instructs individuals to think of stress arousal as a tool that helps maximize performance. By reframing the meaning of the physiological signals that accompany stress, arousal reappraisal breaks the link between negative affective experiences and malignant physiological responses.

INTRODUCTION:
The physiological effects of immersion hypothermia and afterdrop are well-characterized, but the psychological effects are less clear. The purpose of this study was to quantify changes in cognitive function during and after lower body water immersion.

METHODS:
On separate mornings, nine young healthy men participated in both neutral (35 +/- 1 degree C) and cold (13 +/- 1 degree C) water immersion. Subjects rested in neutral air for 30 min followed by 60 min water immersion to the iliac crest and 15 min of recovery in neutral air. Rectal temperature and mean skin temperature were continuously monitored. Metabolic rate, the Stroop Color Word Test (SCWT), and the Profile of Mood State (POMS) were quantified at predetermined intervals.

RESULTS:
During immersion in cold water, rectal temperature was reduced, but SCWT and POMS scores were unchanged relative to baseline. Despite the reduced rectal temperature, little to no shivering was observed during immersion and metabolic rate did not change. During recovery from cold immersion, rectal temperature was further reduced by approximately 0.5 degree C, shivering was noted, and metabolic rate increased. Coincident with this acute afterdrop, SCWT Color-Word performance (delta = -4 +/- 8 vs. 7 +/- 6 correct responses) and Interference score (delta = -2 +/- 7 vs. 4 +/- 8) was impaired relative to recovery from neutral immersion (i.e., when core temperature and metabolic rate did not change).

CONCLUSION:
These results suggest that recovery from lower body cold water immersion elicits the afterdrop phenomenon and shivering, which together impair selective attention as measured by the SCWT.},

  abstract      = {{To inform the debate over whether human sleep can be chronically reduced without consequences, we conducted a dose-response chronic sleep restriction experiment in which waking neurobehavioral and sleep physiological functions were monitored and compared to those for total sleep deprivation.The chronic sleep restriction experiment involved randomization to one of three sleep doses (4 h, 6 h, or 8 h time in bed per night), which were maintained for 14 consecutive days. The total sleep deprivation experiment involved 3 nights without sleep (0 h time in bed). Each study also involved 3 baseline (pre-deprivation) days and 3 recovery days.Both experiments were conducted under standardized laboratory conditions with continuous behavioral, physiological and medical monitoring.A total of n = 48 healthy adults (ages 21–38) participated in the experiments.Nocturnal sleep periods were restricted to 8 h, 6 h or 4 h per day for 14 days, or to 0 h for 3 days. All other sleep was prohibited.Chronic restriction of sleep periods to 4 h or 6 h per night over 14 consecutive days resulted in significant cumulative, dose-dependent deficits in cognitive performance on all tasks. Subjective sleepiness ratings showed an acute response to sleep restriction but only small further increases on subsequent days, and did not significantly differentiate the 6 h and 4 h conditions. Polysomnographic variables and δ power in the non-REM sleep EEG—a putative marker of sleep homeostasis—displayed an acute response to sleep restriction with negligible further changes across the 14 restricted nights. Comparison of chronic sleep restriction to total sleep deprivation showed that the latter resulted in disproportionately large waking neurobehavioral and sleep δ power responses relative to how much sleep was lost. A statistical model revealed that, regardless of the mode of sleep deprivation, lapses in behavioral alertness were nearlinearly related to the cumulative duration of wakefulness in excess of 15.84 h (s.e. 0.73 h).Since chronic restriction of sleep to 6 h or less per night produced cognitive performance deficits equivalent to up to 2 nights of total sleep deprivation, it appears that even relatively moderate sleep restriction can seriously impair waking neurobehavioral functions in healthy adults. Sleepiness ratings suggest that subjects were largely unaware of these increasing cognitive deficits, which may explain why the impact of chronic sleep restriction on waking cognitive functions is often assumed to be benign. Physiological sleep responses to chronic restriction did not mirror waking neurobehavioral responses, but cumulative wakefulness in excess of a 15.84 h predicted performance lapses across all four experimental conditions. This suggests that sleep debt is perhaps best understood as resulting in additional wakefulness that has a neurobiological “cost” which accumulates over time.}},

  abstract      = {Taste receptors function as one of the interfaces between internal and external milieus. Taste receptors for sweet and umami (T1R [taste receptor, type 1]), bitter (T2R [taste receptor, type 2]), and salty (ENaC [epithelial sodium channel]) have been discovered in the recent years, but transduction mechanisms of sour taste and ENaC-independent salt taste are still poorly understood. In addition to these five main taste qualities, the taste system detects such noncanonical "tastes" as water, fat, and complex carbohydrates, but their reception mechanisms require further research. Variations in taste receptor genes between and within vertebrate species contribute to individual and species differences in taste-related behaviors. These variations are shaped by evolutionary forces and reflect species adaptations to their chemical environments and feeding ecology. Principles of drug discovery can be applied to taste receptors as targets in order to develop novel taste compounds to satisfy demand in better artificial sweeteners, enhancers of sugar and sodium taste, and blockers of bitterness of food ingredients and oral medications.},

  abstract      = { ▪ Abstract Humans show substantial differences in taste sensitivity to many different substances. Some of this variation is known to be genetic in origin, and many other inter-individual differences are likely to be partially or wholly determined by genetic mechanisms. Recent advances in the understanding of taste at the molecular level have provided candidate genes that can be evaluated for contributions to phenotypic differences in taste abilities. This approach has provided an understanding of variation in the ability to taste phenylthiocarbamide (PTC), and has resolved long-standing controversies about the genetics of this classic human genetic trait. Significant coding sequence variation exists in taste receptor genes, which suggests that PTC tasting may indicate more general taste sensory variation. However, many aspects of taste perception remain poorly characterized. Better understanding of the molecular components of salty and sour tastes is still needed, as is a more complete picture of second messenger and downstream signaling mechanisms for all taste modalities. More general studies of linkage and association between genetic markers and taste phenotypes may reveal genes encoding proteins that were previously unsuspected to be involved in this sensory process. },

OBJECTIVE: This study assessed how well an assortment of gloves and mittens performed in a very cold environment. METHODS: A convenience sample of gloves and mittens were tested in Antarctica during the winter of 2016 using a calibrated thermometer (range: -148°F to +158°F/-100°C to +70°C) three times over a 0.5-mile distance (~20 minutes). A small sensor on a 10-foot-long cable was taped to the radial surface of the distal small finger on the non-dominant hand. The tested clothing was donned over the probe, the maximum temperature inside the glove/mitten was established near a building exit (ambient temperature approximately 54°F/12°C), and the building was exited, initiating the test. The hand was kept immobile during the test. Some non-heated gloves were tested with chemical heat warmers placed over the volar or dorsal wrist. RESULTS: The highest starting (96°F/36°C) and ending (82°F/28°C) temperatures were with electrically heated gloves. The lowest starting temperature was with electrically heated gloves with the power off (63°F/17°C). Non-heated gloves with an inserted chemical hand warmer had the lowest minimum temperature (33°F/1°C). Maximum temperatures for gloves/mittens did not correlate well with their minimum temperature. CONCLUSIONS: Coverings that maintained finger temperatures within a comfortable and safe range (at or above 59°F/15°C) included the heated gloves and mittens (including some with the power off) and mittens with liners. Mittens without liners (shell) generally performed better than unheated gloves. Better results generally paralleled the item's cost. Inserting chemical heat warmers at the wrist increased heat loss, possibly through the exposed area around the warmer.},

Methods Using the Swedish National Board of Forensic Medicine's toxicology database and the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare's registries on causes of death, dispensed medications, and in-patient care, forensic-toxicological findings were compared with prescription-based estimates of drug use for 27 medications. We modeled expected drug-use periods with the PRE2DUP using an algorithm of demonstrated high validity that evaluates personal drug-purchasing patterns with consideration to possible stockpiling of drugs and package information. Excluding criteria included self-inflicted death and recent in-patient care. Results In data from 18 627 performed autopsies, as well as 10 160 instances of dispensed drug use, the agreement between PRE2DUP drug-use periods and forensic toxicology was, overall, moderate (Cohen's kappa: 0.56 [95\% confidence interval {CI}: 0.55-0.57]) with a positive predictive value, or predicted adherence rate, of 46.0\%. The group-level predicted adherence and agreement were highest for antidepressants, at 71.0\% (Cohen's kappa: 0.74 [CI: 0.73-0.76]), and lowest for cardiovascular drugs, at 21.5\% (Cohen's kappa: 0.33 [CI: 0.31-0.36]). Predicted recreational use (negative predictive value) was low for all investigated drugs (0.0\%-1.4\%). The biological half-life explained 29\% (P = 0.003) of the variability of the false-positive rate. Conclusions Measured agreement between PRE2DUP-based drug-use estimates and forensic-toxicological findings is dependent upon a number of factors, including true continuous drug use and postmortem detectability of the investigated drugs, as well as the occurrence of unconventional dosing and true non-adherence.},

The present study investigated the effect of a combination of 97 mg L-theanine and 40 mg caffeine as compared to placebo treatment on cognitive performance, alertness, blood pressure, and heart rate in a sample of young adults (n = 44). Cognitive performance, self-reported mood, blood pressure, and heart rate were measured before L-theanine and caffeine administration (i.e. at baseline) and 20 min and 70 min thereafter. The combination of moderate levels of L-theanine and caffeine significantly improved accuracy during task switching and self-reported alertness (both P < 0.01) and reduced self-reported tiredness (P < 0.05). There were no significant effects on other cognitive tasks, such as visual search, choice reaction times, or mental rotation. The present results suggest that 97 mg of L-theanine in combination with 40 mg of caffeine helps to focus attention during a demanding cognitive task. },

  abstract      = {Background: Laboratory medicine, like other areas of medicine, is obliged to adhere to high ethical standards. There are particular ethical issues that are unique to laboratory medicine and other areas in which ethical issues uniquely impact laboratory practice. Despite this, there is variability in ethics education within the profession. This review provides a foundation for the study of ethics within laboratory medicine.Content: The Belmont Report identifies 3 core principles in biomedical ethics: respect for persons (including autonomy), beneficence (and its corollary nonmalfeasance), and justice. These core principles must be adhered to in laboratory medicine. Informed consent is vital to maintain patient autonomy. However, balancing patient autonomy with the desire for beneficence can sometimes be difficult when patients refuse testing or treatment. The use of leftover or banked samples is fundamental to the ability to do research, create reference intervals, and develop new tests, but it creates problems with consent. Advances in genetic testing have created unique ethical issues regarding privacy, incidental findings, and informed consent. As in other professions, the emergence of highly contagious and deadly infectious diseases poses a difficult ethical dilemma of helping patients while protecting healthcare workers.Conclusions: Although many clinical laboratorians do not see or treat patients, they must be held accountable to the highest ethical and professional behavior. Recognition and understanding of ethical issues are essential to ethical practice of laboratory medicine.},

  abstract      = {To the extent that selective attention skills are relevant for academic foundations and amenable to training, they represent an important focus for the field of education. Here, drawing on research on the neurobiology of attention, we review hypothesized links between selective attention and processing across three domains important to early academic skills. First, we provide a brief review of the neural bases of selective attention, emphasizing the effects of selective attention on neural processing, as well as the neural systems important to deploying selective attention and managing response conflict. Second, we examine the developmental time course of selective attention. It is argued that developmental differences in selective attention are related to the neural systems important for deploying selective attention and managing response conflict. In contrast, once effectively deployed, selective attention acts through very similar neural mechanisms across ages. In the third section, we relate the processes of selective attention to three domains important to academic foundations: language, literacy, and mathematics. Fourth, drawing on recent literatures on the effects of video-game play and mind-brain training on selective attention, we discuss the possibility of training selective attention. The final section examines the application of these principles to educationally-focused attention-training programs for children.},

If they now ingest (at 0 h) 0.27 (dose A), 0.40 (dose B), 0.53 (dose C), 0.94 (dose D), or 1.33 (dose E) g protein N/kg BW¾ (in the form of casein, ovalbumin, or lactalbumin), the rate of urea N excretion accelerates within 4 h. At dose C a maximal rate of urinary urea N excretion (MRUE) is reached, which averages 55 mg urea N/h per kg BW¾ and which persists for 16 h. Higher doses of protein do not further accelerate urea excretion, but prolong the duration of MRUE to 28 h (after dose E). Blood urea N (BUN) rises by 7-20 mg/100 ml during the first 8 h after dose C to E, and remains stable within ±5 mg/100 ml during the ensuing 8-28 h of MRUE. Each increment of protein above dose C causes a further increment in plasma α-amino N. During infusion of free amino acids at a rate of 110 or 165 mg amino acid N/h per kg BW¾ for 12 h, rate of urea excretion increases to the MRUE value produced by dose C-E of oral protein. These findings indicate that MRUE corresponds to a period of maximal rate of urea synthesis (MRUS). MRUS is greater than MRUE because one fraction of newly formed urea is hydrolyzed in the gastrointestinal tract, and another fraction may accumulate temporarily in body water during the MRUE period. Oral neomycin reduces the proportion of urea hydrolyzed in the gut to less than 20%; its extent is measured by recovery in the urine of a tracer dose of [14C]urea injected intramuscularly during determination of MRUE. Accumulation of urea in body water is estimated from increment in BUN during the period of MRUE measurement (8-24 h after dose E of casein) and from body water measured with 3H2O. Then MRUS is calculated as: ([mg urea N excreted between 8 and 24 h after dose E] + [BUN at 24 h − BUN at 8 h] × [body water]) × (100/% recovery [14C]urea) × (1/kg BW¾) × (1/16 h). MRUS in 10 normal subjects averaged 65 mg urea N/h per kg BW¾ (range 55-76), and in 34 cirrhotics 27 mg urea N/h per kg BW¾ (range 6-64). Among 19 cirrhotic patients fed 40, 60, 80, or 100 g protein daily for successive 10 day periods, the occurrences of hyperammonemia, hyperaminoacidemia, and encephalopathy at each level of protein intake were inversely related to MRUS value.},

  abstract      = { Abstract Natural disasters do not affect people equally. In fact, a vulnerability approach to disasters would suggest that inequalities in exposure and sensitivity to risk as well as inequalities in access to resources, capabilities, and opportunities systematically disadvantage certain groups of people, rendering them more vulnerable to the impact of natural disasters. In this article we address the specific vulnerability of girls and women with respect to mortality from natural disasters and their aftermath. Biological and physiological differences between the sexes are unlikely to explain large-scale gender differences in mortality rates. Social norms and role behaviors provide some further explanation, but what is likely to matter most is the everyday socioeconomic status of women. In a sample of up to 141 countries over the period 1981 to 2002 we analyze the effect of disaster strength and its interaction with the socioeconomic status of women on the change in the gender gap in life expectancy. We find, first, that natural disasters lower the life expectancy of women more than that of men. In other words, natural disasters (and their subsequent impact) on average kill more women than men or kill women at an earlier age than men. Since female life expectancy is generally higher than that of males, for most countries natural disasters narrow the gender gap in life expectancy. Second, the stronger the disaster (as approximated by the number of people killed relative to population size), the stronger this effect on the gender gap in life expectancy. That is, major calamities lead to more severe impacts on female life expectancy (relative to that of males) than do smaller disasters. Third, the higher women's socioeconomic status, the weaker is this effect on the gender gap in life expectancy. Taken together our results show that it is the socially constructed gender-specific vulnerability of females built into everyday socioeconomic patterns that lead to the relatively higher female disaster mortality rates compared to men. },

  abstract      = {The concept and existence of learning styles has been fraught with controversy, and recent studies have thrown their existence into doubt. Yet, many students still hold to the conventional wisdom that learning styles are legitimate, and may adapt their outside of class study strategies to match these learning styles. Thus, this study aims to assess if undergraduate anatomy students are more likely to utilize study strategies that align with their hypothetical learning styles (using the VARK analysis from Fleming and Mills, , Improve Acad. 11:137–155) and, if so, does this alignment correlate with their outcome in an anatomy course. Relatedly, this study examines whether students’ VARK learning styles are correlated with course outcomes regardless of the students’ study strategies, and whether any study strategies are correlated with course outcomes, regardless of student-specific VARK results. A total of 426 anatomy students from the 2015 and 2016 Fall semesters completed a study strategies survey and an online VARK questionnaire. Results demonstrated that most students did not report study strategies that correlated with their VARK assessment, and that student performance in anatomy was not correlated with their score in any VARK categories. Rather, some specific study strategies (irrespective of VARK results), such as use of the virtual microscope, were found to be positively correlated with final class grade. However, the alignment of these study strategies with VARK results had no correlation with anatomy course outcomes. Thus, this research provides further evidence that the conventional wisdom about learning styles should be rejected by educators and students alike.

  abstract      = {Under 2013 utvecklade FSPOS arbetsgrupp för Kontinuitetssäkring1 en vägledning om
kontinuitetshantering för aktörer i den finansiella sektorn. Vägledningen har sedan dess
kompletterats i omgångar utifrån sektorns och de finansiella aktörernas behov. FSPOS
Vägledning för Kontinuitetshantering inkluderar ett antal appendix, bland annat ett som
beskriver hur en organisation kan arbeta med kontinuitetshantering inom ITverksamheten. Detta dokument består av innehållet i Appendix F – Kontinuitetshantering
för IT-verksamheten samt ett självskattningsformulär gällande kontinuitetshantering för
IT-verksamheten (avsnitt H.7. i FSPOS Vägledning för Kontinuitetshantering).
För aktörer i den finansiella sektorn får avbrott i IT-tjänster stora konsekvenser för
verksamheten vilket i förlängningen leder till konsekvenser för kunderna. ITverksamheten är därför en viktig stödfunktion, oavsett om den är intern eller outsourcad
till tredje part, och det är viktigt att säkerställa robusthet i denna. Detta kan med fördel
göras genom ett strukturerat arbete med kontinuitetshantering.
Kontinuitetshantering handlar om att skapa redundans vilket IT-verksamheten
vanligtvis både identifierat och arbetar intensivt med. Detta genom exempelvis back-up,
spegling av viktig information och systematiserad incidentrapportering och -hantering.
Även om IT-verksamheten vanligtvis arbetar med att skapa redundans för kritiska
system/data etc. kan ett mer systematiskt kontinuitetshanteringsarbete ge stora
fördelar, exempelvis i form av effektivitetsvinster eller identifiering av brister i befintliga
redundanslösningar.
Den process för kontinuitetshantering som presenteras i detta appendix följer processen
som presenteras i standarderna ISO 223012 om ledningssystem för kontinuitetshantering
och ISO 270313 om kontinuitetshantering för IT-verksamhet. Processtegen är således de
samma som de processteg som presenteras i vägledningens huvuddokument, med
skillnaden att detta appendix ger fördjupad vägledning specifikt för IT-verksamheten
genom samtliga processteg. Även det processorienterade ramverket IT Infrastructure
Library (ITIL) som ger vägledning för styrning och leverans av IT-tjänster ger
ingångsvärden för hur företag och organisationer kan arbeta med kontinuitet
beträffande leverans av IT-tjänster.},

  abstract      = {Body-mass index (BMI) has increased steadily in most countries in parallel with a rise in the proportion of the population who live in cities1,2. This has led to a widely reported view that urbanization is one of the most important drivers of the global rise in obesity3-6. Here we use 2,009 population-based studies, with measurements of height and weight in more than 112 million adults, to report national, regional and global trends in mean BMI segregated by place of residence (a rural or urban area) from 1985 to 2017. We show that, contrary to the dominant paradigm, more than 55% of the global rise in mean BMI from 1985 to 2017--and more than 80% in some low- and middle-income regions--was due to increases in BMI in rural areas. This large contribution stems from the fact that, with the exception of women in sub-Saharan Africa, BMI is increasing at the same rate or faster in rural areas than in cities in low- and middle-income regions. These trends have in turn resulted in a closing--and in some countries reversal--of the gap in BMI between urban and rural areas in low- and middle-income countries, especially for women. In high-income and industrialized countries, we noted a persistently higher rural BMI, especially for women. There is an urgent need for an integrated approach to rural nutrition that enhances financial and physical access to healthy foods, to avoid replacing the rural undernutrition disadvantage in poor countries with a more general malnutrition disadvantage that entails excessive consumption of low-quality calories.},

Hälso- och sjukvården i Sverige är en kritisk samhällsfunktion som på en kort tid
genomgått en omfattande teknisk modernisering. Tanken med denna
modernisering är att minska den administrativa och operativa arbetsbördan och
bidra med mer precisa analyser och behandlingar. Den har dock också bidragit till
att vanliga IT-relaterade brister såsom mjukvarubuggar numera kan ha en reell
effekt på mänskligt liv.
Denna studie undersöker vilka informations- och styrsystem som finns inom hälsooch
sjukvård i Sverige och vilka incidenter som förekommit som en följd av
datorrelaterade problem med dessa system. Analysen baseras på vetenskaplig
litteratur, incidentdatabaser i Sverige och USA, intervjuer och en enkät.
Resultatet visar att det finns över 20 000 olika typer av medicintekniska produkter
(MTP) som nyttjas och att allt från laserskrivare till infusionspumpar ses som
MTP:er. Intervjuerna visar dock att produkter som ligger närmre administration
och drift (t.ex. patientjournalsystem, routrar och nätverkskablar) ses som
informationsteknologi (IT), medan produkter som ligger närmre patienter (t.ex.
infusionspumpar och pacemakers) ses som ”riktiga” MTP:er.
Analys av incidentdatabasen REIDAR som registrerar svenska MTP-relaterade
incidenter visar att cirka 30% av alla incidenter inom Sveriges hälso- och sjukvård
har varit datorrelaterade, samt att antalet datorrelaterade incidenter ökar i ungefär
samma takt som antalet icke-datorrelaterade incidenter minskar (ett liknande
mönster kan ses för USA). Dödsfall orsakas av cirka 1.7% av alla datorrelaterade
incidenter, och primärt av lungventilatorer, dialysapparater och defibrillatorer. De
allra flesta datorrelaterade incidenter rör dock infusionspumpar. Denna
incidentdatabas ses av respondenterna som kritisk för god nationell samverkan –
det som händer ett sjukhus händer sannolikt även andra så småningom – men
rapporteringsfrekvensen till den har sedan den startades varit lägre än förväntat.
Ett sätt att öka den vore att modernisera webbapplikationen som exponerar
databasen, särskilt gällande sök- och analysfunktionalitet.
Resultatet visar även att en bättre intern kommunikation behövs mellan IT och
medicinteknik/vården. Detta kan exempelvis behandlas genom fysisk samverkan,
utbildning eller sammanslagning av medicinteknik och IT (vilket har gjorts inom
vissa Landsting i Sverige).
Slutligen så finns det relativt få omfattande IT-säkerhetsrelaterade incidenter,
såsom datormaskar, som uppmärksammats i Sverige. Sårbarheten för IT-attacker
är dock stor och framtida IT-attacker är en risk som bör tas på stort allvar.

Summary
The Swedish healthcare system is a critical infrastructure service that in a short
timespan has undergone comprehensive technological modernization. The
rationale behind this modernization is to decrease the administrative and operative
burden and help to yield more precise analyses and treatments. It has however also
enabled regular IT related issues such as software bugs to have a real effect on
human life.
This report presents a study of what information- and control systems that are used
within healthcare and what incidents that have occurred due to computer related
problems with these systems. The analysis is based on scientific literature,
incident databases within Sweden and USA, interviews and a questionnaire.
The results show that there are more than 20 000 different kinds of medical devices
which are used and that everything from laser printers to infusion pumps are
viewed as medical devices. The interviews however show that products that are
closer to administration (e.g., patient journal systems, routers and network cables)
are however viewed as IT, while products that are closer to patients (e.g., infusion
pumps and pacemakers) are viewed as “true” operative medical devices.
Analysis of the incident database REIDAR that registers Swedish medical device
related incidents show that approximately 30% of all such incidents within
Swedish healthcare are computer related, and that the number of computer related
incidents increase at about the same pace as the number of non-computer related
incidents decrease. Deaths are caused by 1.7% of all computer related incidents,
primarily by lung ventilators, dialysis devices and defibrillators. Most incidents
however involve infusion pumps. This incident database are viewed by the
respondents as critical for sound national cooperation – what happens at one
hospital is likely to eventually occur for others’ – but the reporting frequency to it
has since its creation been lower than expected. One means of increasing it would
be to modernize the web application that exposes it, in particular regarding search
and analysis functionality.
The results also show that a better internal communication is required between IT
and medical technicians/healthcare. This can be achieved by greater physical
collaboration, education or merging the departments concerning IT and medical
devices (which has been done at some locations in Sweden).
Finally, relatively few significant IT security related incidents, such as computer
worms, have been observed in Sweden. However, the IT security vulnerability is
large and the risk for future IT attacks should be viewed with concern.

  abstract      = {Canine transmissible venereal tumor is one of the few cancer lineages that is transferred among individuals through contact. It arose millennia ago and has been evolving independently from its hosts ever since. Baez-Ortega et al. looked at the phylogenetic history of the cancer and describe several distinctive mutational patterns (see the Perspective by Maley and Shibata). Most notably, both positive and negative selection show only weak or distant signals. This suggests that the main driver of the lineage{\textquoteright}s evolution is neutral genetic drift. Understanding the influence of drift may reshape how we think about long-term cancer evolution.Science, this issue p. eaau9923; see also p. 440INTRODUCTIONThe canine transmissible venereal tumor (CTVT) is a sexually transmitted cancer that manifests as genital tumors in dogs. This cancer first arose in an individual {\textquotedblleft}founder dog{\textquotedblright} several thousand years ago and has since survived by transfer of living cancer cells to new hosts during coitus. Today, CTVT affects dogs around the world and is the oldest and most prolific known cancer lineage. CTVT thus provides an opportunity to explore the evolution of cancer over the long term and to track the unusual biological transition from multicellular organism to obligate conspecific asexual parasite. Furthermore, the CTVT genome, acting as a living biomarker, has recorded the changing mutagenic environments experienced by this cancer throughout millennia and across continents.RATIONALETo capture the genetic diversity of the CTVT lineage, we analyzed somatic mutations extracted from the protein-coding genomes (exomes) of 546 globally distributed CTVT tumors. We inferred a time-resolved phylogenetic tree for the clone and used this to trace the worldwide spread of the disease and to select subsets of mutations acquired at known geographical locations and time periods. Computational methods were applied to extract mutational signatures and to measure their exposures across time and space. In addition, we assessed the activity of selection using ratios of nonsynonymous and synonymous variants.RESULTSThe CTVT phylogeny reveals that the lineage first arose from its founder dog 4000 to 8500 years ago, likely in Asia, with the most recent common ancestor of modern globally distributed tumors occurring ~1900 years ago. CTVT underwent a rapid global expansion within the past 500 years, likely aided by intensification of human maritime travel. We identify a highly specific mutational signature dominated by C\&gt;T mutations at GTCCA pentanucleotide contexts, which operated in CTVT up until ~1000 years ago. The number of mutations caused by ultraviolet light exposure is correlated with latitude of tumor collection, and we identify CTVTs with heritable hyperactivity of an endogenous mutational process. Several {\textquotedblleft}driver{\textquotedblright} mutation candidates are identified in the basal trunk of the CTVT tree, but there is little evidence for ongoing positive selection. Although negative selection is detectable, its effect is largely confined to genes with known essential functions, thus implying that CTVT predominantly evolves through neutral processes.CONCLUSIONWe have traced the evolution of a transmissible cancer over several thousand years, tracking its spread across continents and contrasting the mutational processes and selective forces that molded its genome with those described in human cancers. The identification of a highly context-specific mutational process that operated in the past but subsequently vanished, as well as correlation of ultraviolet light{\textendash}induced DNA damage with latitude, highlight the potential for long-lived, widespread clonal organisms to act as biomarkers for mutagenic exposures. Our results suggest that neutral genetic drift is the dominant evolutionary force operating on cancer over the long term, in contrast to the ongoing positive selection that is often observed in short-lived human cancers. The weakness of negative selection in this asexual lineage may be expected to lead to the progressive accumulation of deleterious mutations, invoking Muller{\textquoteright}s ratchet and raising the possibility that CTVT may be declining in fitness despite its global success.Cancer evolution over thousands of years.The canine transmissible venereal tumor (CTVT) is an ancient contagious cancer with a global distribution. We sequenced the exomes of 546 CTVT tumors and identified somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs). These were used to construct a time-resolved phylogenetic tree, yielding insights into the cancer{\textquoteright}s phylogeography, mutational processes, and signatures of selection across thousands of years. Notably, a highly context-specific mutational pattern named signature A was identified, which was active in the past but ceased to operate about 1000 years ago. BP, years before present.The canine transmissible venereal tumor (CTVT) is a cancer lineage that arose several millennia ago and survives by {\textquotedblleft}metastasizing{\textquotedblright} between hosts through cell transfer. The somatic mutations in this cancer record its phylogeography and evolutionary history. We constructed a time-resolved phylogeny from 546 CTVT exomes and describe the lineage{\textquoteright}s worldwide expansion. Examining variation in mutational exposure, we identify a highly context-specific mutational process that operated early in the cancer{\textquoteright}s evolution but subsequently vanished, correlate ultraviolet-light mutagenesis with tumor latitude, and describe tumors with heritable hyperactivity of an endogenous mutational process. CTVT displays little evidence of ongoing positive selection, and negative selection is detectable only in essential genes. We illustrate how long-lived clonal organisms capture changing mutagenic environments, and reveal that neutral genetic drift is the dominant feature of long-term cancer evolution.},

  abstract      = {The worldwide obesity epidemic1 makes it important to understand how lipid turnover (the capacity to store and remove lipids) regulates adipose tissue mass. Cross-sectional studies have shown that excess body fat is associated with decreased adipose lipid removal rates2,3. Whether lipid turnover is constant over the life span or changes during long-term weight increase or loss is unknown. We determined the turnover of fat cell lipids in adults followed for up to 16 years, by measuring the incorporation of nuclear bomb test-derived 14C in adipose tissue triglycerides. Lipid removal rate decreases during aging, with a failure to reciprocally adjust the rate of lipid uptake resulting in weight gain. Substantial weight loss is not driven by changes in lipid removal but by the rate of lipid uptake in adipose tissue. Furthermore, individuals with a low baseline lipid removal rate are more likely to remain weight-stable after weight loss. Therefore, lipid turnover adaptation might be important for maintaining pronounced weight loss. Together these findings identify adipose lipid turnover as an important factor for the long-term development of overweight/obesity and weight loss maintenance in humans. Long-term changes in body weight are determined by rates of adipose lipid turnover.},

Eighty patients with meningitis and meningoencephalitis were divided into two groups: Group I – patients with NB (n = 40) and Group II – patients with TBE (n = 40). Diagnosis was based on the clinical picture, CSF examination and presence of specific antibodies in serum and CSF. The control group (CG) consisted of healthy blood donors (n = 25) and patients in whom inflammatory process in central nervous system was excluded (n = 25). Concentration of TLR-2 was measured using a commercial kit [TLR-2 Elisa Kit (EIAab, China)]. The serum and CSF TLR-2 concentration of NB patients was significantly higher than in CG. The serum and CSF TLR-2 concentration in TBE patients was significantly higher than in the CG. Receiver operating characteristic analysis of the serum TLR-2 concentration showed significant differences between the group of patients with NB and a group of patients with TBE. TLR-2 is involved in the development of inflammatory process in the CNS caused by both tick-borne pathogens: viral and bacterial as TLR-2 concentration in both CSF and serum differentiates these groups from healthy patients. Although TLR-2 cannot be used as a sole and reliable biomarker differentiating NB from TBE, results of our study are a step forward toward discovering such biomarker in the future. },

  abstract       = {Sourdough fermented bread has been suggested to have beneficial health effects, in part mediated by increased satiety in the postprandial phase, but only limited research has been conducted to verify this. The current study aimed to investigate the effect of the amounts of sourdough and rye in soft bread on postprandial appetite. On 6 occasions, 23 healthy volunteers consumed 5 different test breads, with varying amount of rye and sourdough, and a yeast-fermented refined wheat control bread as part of a breakfast meal. The sourdough ranged between 9&ndash;51% of dough weight and rye content between 35&ndash;48% of flour weight. Appetite was recorded using visual analogue scales from immediately before breakfast and every 30 min the following 4 h. An ad libitum lunch was served 4 h after the breakfast meal, from which voluntary energy intake was measured. While some of the test breads resulted in lower hunger ratings and increased sense of fullness compared to the refined wheat bread, there were no differences between the test breads. The content of rye in the test breads differed within a narrow range, which might explain the lack of a consistent effect of rye on appetite. Microstructural examination of the test breads showed an increased aggregation of proteins in the breads with high content of sourdough, indicating additional changes to the breads, beyond change in pH, which may counteract the potential effect of decreased pH in the bread on appetite. In conclusion, our study does not support an effect of sourdough on appetite and ad libitum food intake.},

  abstract      = {The epidemiological evidence regarding the association of coffee and tea consumption with prostate cancer risk is inconclusive, and few cohort studies have assessed these associations by disease stage and grade. We examined the associations of coffee (total, caffeinated and decaffeinated) and tea intake with prostate cancer risk in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition. Among 142,196 men, 7,036 incident prostate cancer cases were diagnosed over 14 years of follow-up. Data on coffee and tea consumption were collected through validated country-specific food questionnaires at baseline. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to compute hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI). Models were stratified by center and age, and adjusted for anthropometric, lifestyle and dietary factors. Median coffee and tea intake were 375 and 106 mL/day, respectively, but large variations existed by country. Comparing the highest (median of 855 mL/day) versus lowest (median of 103 mL/day) consumers of coffee and tea (450 vs. 12 mL/day) the HRs were 1.02 (95\% CI, 0.94–1.09) and 0.98 (95\% CI, 0.90–1.07) for risk of total prostate cancer and 0.97 (95\% CI, 0.79–1.21) and 0.89 (95\% CI, 0.70–1.13) for risk of fatal disease, respectively. No evidence of association was seen for consumption of total, caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee or tea and risk of total prostate cancer or cancer by stage, grade or fatality in this large cohort. Further investigations are needed to clarify whether an association exists by different preparations or by concentrations and constituents of these beverages.},

Our study examines the association between serum levels of vitamin D and cancer incidence in the Capital Region of Denmark. Individuals who had vitamin D analyzed at The Copenhagen General Practitioners Laboratory between April 2004 and January 2010 were linked to Danish registries with end of follow-up date at Dec 31st 2014, excluding individuals with pre-existing cancer. Cox regression models adjusted for age in one-year intervals, sex, month of sampling, and Charlson Comorbidity Index were applied. The study population of 217,244 individuals had a median vitamin D level of 46 nmol/L (IQR 27–67 nmol/L). Non-melanoma skin cancer was the most frequent form of cancer, followed by breast-, lung-, and prostate cancers. No associations were found between increments of 10 nmol/L vitamin D and incidence of breast, colorectal, urinary, ovary or corpus uteri cancer. However, higher levels of vitamin D were associated with higher incidence of non-melanoma (HR 1.09 [1.09–1.1]) and melanoma skin cancer (HR 1.1 [1.08–1.13]) as well as prostate (HR 1.05 [1.03–1.07]) and hematological cancers (HR 1.03 [1.01–1.06]), but with lower incidence of lung cancer (HR 0.95 [0.93–0.97]). In our study, vitamin D levels are not associated with the incidence of several major cancer types, but higher levels are significantly associated with a higher incidence of skin, prostate, and hematological cancers as well as a lower incidence of lung cancer. These results do not support an overall protective effect against cancer by vitamin D.},

  abstract      = { BackgroundEthylene glycol is a highly toxic compound found in various household products. Cases of poisoning are rare but may be fatal unless diagnosed and treated promptly. Early recognition of poisoning is critical for the management and recovery of patients. Indirect testing is not specific for the presence of ethylene glycol. Therefore, urgent and accurate measurement should be sought if ingestion is suspected in order to determine the need for treatment with an antidote. Here, we present the validation of an automated assay for measurement of ethylene glycol on an Abbott Architect using a commercially available kit (Catachem).MethodsAnalytical parameters of imprecision, linearity, stability and bias were determined using spiked human plasma samples processed on both the Catachem assay and on an in-house gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method. Interference was assessed using samples collected into a variety of sample collection tubes and spiked with a number of alcohols.ResultsExcellent agreement was observed between the two methodologies with the enzymatic assay demonstrating linearity and precision across the relevant clinical range (50–3000 mg/L). In addition, the Catachem assay displayed no interference from a number of different sample tubes and alcohols. However, propylene glycol interference was observed at concentrations associated with excessive use (>1 g/L) and 2,3-butanediol interference observed at concentrations associated with butanone ingestion. Inspection of the enzymatic reaction profile was found to differentiate between alcohols.ConclusionsThis automated assay is suitable for the diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning and is now in routine use, enabling the laboratory to provide a rapid 24 h service with support by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as necessary. },

Understanding how decision fatigue affects medical decision making is important for achieving both efficiency and fairness in health care. In this study, we investigate the potential role of decision fatigue in orthopedic surgeons' decisions to operate, exploiting a natural experiment whereby patient allocation to time slots is plausibly randomized at the level of the patient. Our results show that patients who met a surgeon toward the end of his or her work shift were 33 percentage points less likely to be scheduled for an operation compared with those who were seen first. In a logistic regression with doctor-fixed effects and standard errors clustered at the level of the doctor, the odds of operation were estimated to decrease by 10.5\% (odds ratio = 0.895, p < .001; 95\% CI [0.842, 0.951]) for each additional patient appointment in the doctors' work shift. This pattern in surgeons' decision making is consistent with decision fatigue. Because long shifts are common in medicine, the effect of decision fatigue could be substantial and may have important implications for patient outcomes.},

We show that a handful of transnational corporations have become a major force shaping the global intertwined system of people and planet. Transnational corporations in agriculture, forestry, seafood, cement, minerals and fossil energy cause environmental impacts and possess the ability to influence critical functions of the biosphere. We review evidence of current practices and identify six observed features of change towards ‘corporate biosphere stewardship’, with significant potential for upscaling. Actions by transnational corporations, if combined with effective public policies and improved governmental regulations, could substantially accelerate sustainability efforts.},

  abstract      = {Controversy exists about the maximum amount of protein that can be utilized for lean tissue-building purposes in a single meal for those involved in regimented resistance training. It has been proposed that muscle protein synthesis is maximized in young adults with an intake of ~ 20-25 g of a high-quality protein; anything above this amount is believed to be oxidized for energy or transaminated to form urea and other organic acids. However, these findings are specific to the provision of fast-digesting proteins without the addition of other macronutrients. Consumption of slower-acting protein sources, particularly when consumed in combination with other macronutrients, would delay absorption and thus conceivably enhance the utilization of the constituent amino acids. The purpose of this paper was twofold: 1) to objectively review the literature in an effort to determine an upper anabolic threshold for per-meal protein intake; 2) draw relevant conclusions based on the current data so as to elucidate guidelines for per-meal daily protein distribution to optimize lean tissue accretion. Both acute and long-term studies on the topic were evaluated and their findings placed into context with respect to per-meal utilization of protein and the associated implications to distribution of protein feedings across the course of a day. The preponderance of data indicate that while consumption of higher protein doses (> 20 g) results in greater AA oxidation, this is not the fate for all the additional ingested AAs as some are utilized for tissue-building purposes. Based on the current evidence, we conclude that to maximize anabolism one should consume protein at a target intake of 0.4 g/kg/meal across a minimum of four meals in order to reach a minimum of 1.6 g/kg/day. Using the upper daily intake of 2.2 g/kg/day reported in the literature spread out over the same four meals would necessitate a maximum of 0.55 g/kg/meal.},

Here we describe and validate the 2B-Alert App, the first mobile application that progressively learns an individual’s trait-like response to sleep deprivation in real time, to generate increasingly more accurate individualized predictions of alertness. We incorporated a Bayesian learning algorithm within the validated Unified Model of Performance to automatically and gradually adapt the model parameters to an individual after each psychomotor vigilance test. We implemented the resulting model and the psychomotor vigilance test as a smartphone application (2B-Alert App), and prospectively validated its performance in a 62-hr total sleep deprivation study in which 21 participants used the app to perform psychomotor vigilance tests every 3 hr and obtain real-time individualized predictions after each test. The temporal profiles of reaction times on the app-conducted psychomotor vigilance tests were well correlated with and as sensitive as those obtained with a previously characterized psychomotor vigilance test device. The app progressively learned each individual’s trait-like response to sleep deprivation throughout the study, yielding increasingly more accurate predictions of alertness for the last 24 hr of total sleep deprivation as the number of psychomotor vigilance tests increased. After only 12 psychomotor vigilance tests, the accuracy of the model predictions was comparable to the peak accuracy obtained using all psychomotor vigilance tests. With the ability to make real-time individualized predictions of the effects of sleep deprivation on future alertness, the 2B-Alert App can be used to tailor personalized fatigue management strategies, facilitating self-management of alertness and safety in operational and non-operational settings.},

In this work, we provide an optimization algorithm, suited for mobile computing platforms, to determine when and how much caffeine to consume, so as to safely maximize neurobehavioural performance at the desired time of the day, under any sleep-loss condition. The algorithm is based on our previously validated Unified Model of Performance, which predicts the effect of caffeine consumption on a psychomotor vigilance task. We assessed the algorithm by comparing the caffeine-dosing strategies (timing and amount) it identified with the dosing strategies used in four experimental studies, involving total and partial sleep loss. Through computer simulations, we showed that the algorithm yielded caffeine-dosing strategies that enhanced performance of the predicted psychomotor vigilance task by up to 64\% while using the same total amount of caffeine as in the original studies. In addition, the algorithm identified strategies that resulted in equivalent performance to that in the experimental studies while reducing caffeine consumption by up to 65\%. Our work provides the first quantitative caffeine optimization tool for designing effective strategies to maximize neurobehavioural performance and to avoid excessive caffeine consumption during any arbitrary sleep-loss condition.},

However, none of the existing computational tools is publicly available, and the commercially available tools do not account for the beneficial effects of caffeine on performance, limiting their practical utility. Here, we introduce 2B-Alert Web, an open-access tool for predicting neurobehavioral performance, which accounts for the effects of sleep/wake schedules, time of day, and caffeine consumption, while incorporating the latest scientific findings in sleep restriction, sleep extension, and recovery sleep.We combined our validated Unified Model of Performance and our validated caffeine model to form a single, integrated modeling framework instantiated as a Web-enabled tool. 2B-Alert Web allows users to input daily sleep/wake schedules and caffeine consumption (dosage and time) to obtain group-average predictions of neurobehavioral performance based on psychomotor vigilance tasks. 2B-Alert Web is accessible at: https://2b-alert-web.bhsai.org.The 2B-Alert Web tool allows users to obtain predictions for mean response time, mean reciprocal response time, and number of lapses. The graphing tool allows for simultaneous display of up to seven different sleep/wake and caffeine schedules. The schedules and corresponding predicted outputs can be saved as a Microsoft Excel file; the corresponding plots can be saved as an image file. The schedules and predictions are erased when the user logs off, thereby maintaining privacy and confidentiality.The publicly accessible 2B-Alert Web tool is available for operators, schedulers, and neurobehavioral scientists as well as the general public to determine the impact of any given sleep/wake schedule, caffeine consumption, and time of day on performance of a group of individuals. This evidence-based tool can be used as a decision aid to design effective work schedules, guide the design of future sleep restriction and caffeine studies, and increase public awareness of the effects of sleep amounts, time of day, and caffeine on alertness.}},

  abstract      = {Caffeine is the most widely consumed stimulant to counter sleep-loss effects. While the pharmacokinetics of caffeine in the body is well-understood, its alertness-restoring effects are still not well characterized. In fact, mathematical models capable of predicting the effects of varying doses of caffeine on objective measures of vigilance are not available. In this paper, we describe a phenomenological model of the dose-dependent effects of caffeine on psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) performance of sleep-deprived subjects. We used the two-process model of sleep regulation to quantify performance during sleep loss in the absence of caffeine and a dose-dependent multiplier factor derived from the Hill equation to model the effects of single and repeated caffeine doses. We developed and validated the model fits and predictions on PVT lapse (number of reaction times exceeding 500ms) data from two separate laboratory studies. At the population-average level, the model captured the effects of a range of caffeine doses (50–300mg), yielding up to a 90% improvement over the two-process model. Individual-specific caffeine models, on average, predicted the effects up to 23% better than population-average caffeine models. The proposed model serves as a useful tool for predicting the dose-dependent effects of caffeine on the PVT performance of sleep-deprived subjects and, therefore, can be used for determining caffeine doses that optimize the timing and duration of peak performance.},

We recently developed a unified model of performance (UMP) to predict the effects of the continuum of sleep loss—from chronic sleep restriction (CSR) to total sleep deprivation (TSD) challenges—and validated it using data from two studies of one laboratory. Here, we significantly extended this effort by validating the UMP predictions across a wide range of sleep/wake schedules from different studies and laboratories.We developed the UMP on psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) lapse data from one study encompassing four different CSR conditions (7 d of 3, 5, 7, and 9 h of sleep/night), and predicted performance in five other studies (from four laboratories), including different combinations of TSD (40 to 88 h), CSR (2 to 6 h of sleep/night), control (8 to 10 h of sleep/night), and nap (nocturnal and diurnal) schedules.The UMP accurately predicted PVT performance trends across 14 different sleep/wake conditions, yielding average prediction errors between 7\\% and 36\\%, with the predictions lying within 2 standard errors of the measured data 87\\% of the time. In addition, the UMP accurately predicted performance impairment (average error of 15\\%) for schedules (TSD and naps) not used in model development.The unified model of performance can be used as a tool to help design sleep/wake schedules to optimize the extent and duration of neurobehavioral performance and to accelerate recovery after sleep loss.We showed that, given the sleep/wake schedule of a group of individuals, one mathematical model can accurately predict neurobehavioral performance across a whole host of sleep-loss conditions, including conditions considerably different from those used in model development. In particular, the model accurately predicted the effects of sleep loss (total and partial) and countermeasure strategies, such as extended sleep and short daytime sleep episodes, with errors in model predictions no greater than those observed in the experimental performance data. Such a validated model can be used to generate hypotheses that can be experimentally tested, and to design optimal sleep/wake schedules for maintaining performance at desired levels at specified times of the day or for accelerating recovery following sleep loss.}},

We then assessed the accuracy of this new UMP in predicting performance across multiple studies.We hypothesized that the pharmacodynamics of caffeine vary similarly during both wakefulness and sleep, and that caffeine has a multiplicative effect on performance. Accordingly, to represent the effects of caffeine in the UMP, we multiplied a dose-dependent caffeine factor (which accounts for the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of caffeine) to the performance estimated in the absence of caffeine. We assessed the UMP predictions in 14 distinct laboratory- and field-study conditions, including 7 different sleep-loss schedules (from 5 h of sleep per night to continuous sleep loss for 85 h) and 6 different caffeine doses (from placebo to repeated 200 mg doses to a single dose of 600 mg).The UMP accurately predicted group-average psychomotor vigilance task performance data across the different sleep loss and caffeine conditions (6\\% \\&lt; error \\&lt; 27\\%), yielding greater accuracy for mild and moderate sleep loss conditions than for more severe cases.

  abstract      = {Performance prediction models based on the classical two-process model of sleep regulation are reasonably effective at predicting alertness and neurocognitive performance during total sleep deprivation (TSD). However, during sleep restriction (partial sleep loss) performance predictions based on such models have been found to be less accurate. Because most modern operational environments are predominantly characterized by chronic sleep restriction (CSR) rather than by episodic TSD, the practical utility of this class of models has been limited. To better quantify performance during both CSR and TSD, we developed a unified mathematical model that incorporates extant sleep debt as a function of a known sleep/wake history, with recent history exerting greater influence. This incorporation of sleep/wake history into the classical two-process model captures an individual's capacity to recover during sleep as a function of sleep debt and naturally bridges the continuum from CSR to TSD by reducing to the classical two-process model in the case of TSD. We validated the proposed unified model using psychomotor vigilance task data from three prior studies involving TSD, CSR, and sleep extension. We compared and contrasted the fits, within-study predictions, and across-study predictions from the unified model against predictions generated by two previously published models, and found that the unified model more accurately represented multiple experimental studies and consistently predicted sleep restriction scenarios better than the existing models. In addition, we found that the model parameters obtained by fitting TSD data could be used to predict performance in other sleep restriction scenarios for the same study populations, and vice versa. Furthermore, this model better accounted for the relatively slow recovery process that is known to characterize CSR, as well as the enhanced performance that has been shown to result from sleep banking.},

Storage of blood samples after centrifugation, decapping and initial sampling allows ordering of additional blood tests. The pre-analytic stability of biochemistry and immunochemistry analytes has been studied in detail, but little is known about the post-analytical stability in incurred samples.
Methods
We examined the stability of 23 routine analytes on the Dimension Vista® (Siemens Healthineers, Denmark): 42–60 routine samples in lithium-heparin gel tubes (Vacutainer, BD, USA) were centrifuged at 3000×g for 10min. Immediately after centrifugation, initial concentration of analytes were measured in duplicate (t=0). The tubes were stored decapped at room temperature and re-analyzed after 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10h in singletons. The concentration from reanalysis were normalized to initial concentration (t=0). Internal acceptance criteria for bias and total error were used to determine stability of each analyte. Additionally, evaporation from the decapped blood collection tubes and the residual platelet count in the plasma after centrifugation were quantified.
Results and conclusion
We report a post-analytical stability of most routine analytes of ≥8h and do therefore – with few exceptions – suggest a standard 8hour-time limit for reordering and reanalysis of analytes in incurred samples.},

Although it is known that bilirubin is photo-sensitive, detailed effects of both temperature and artificial light exposure on bilirubin stability in plasma have not been well investigated. We determined the impact of temperature and artificial light on bilirubin stability in plasma.
Methods
Plasma total and direct bilirubin were analyzed using a diazo method. The aliquots of 38 samples were stored at 3°C and 22°C with light protection for 2, 4, 8, and 24h respectively before analysis. The aliquots of 20 samples with normal bilirubin and additional 20 with elevated bilirubin were exposed to artificial light for 2, 4, 8, 24, and 48h at 22°C, and total and direct bilirubin were measured. The differences between the baselines and subsequent measurements were analyzed with analysis of variance.
Results
The baseline total bilirubin was 9.6±8.1mg/dl (mean±SD) and the concentrations were 9.6±8.2, 9.0±7.4, 9.0±7.5, and 8.8±7.5mg/dl at 3°C and 9.5±8.1, 9.0±7.4, 9.6±8.1, and 9.5±8.0mg/dl at 22°C after 2, 4, 8, and 24h (p>0.05, n=38). The baseline direct bilirubin was 1.3±1.2mg/dl and the concentrations after 2, 4, 8, and 24h were 1.4±1.2, 1.4±1.2, 1.5±1.2, and 1.3±1.1mg/dl at 3°C and 1.4±1.1, 1.3±1.1, 1.3±1.1, and 1.3±1.0mg/dl at 22°C (p>0.05, n=19). In samples with elevated bilirubin exposed to light at 22°C, the baseline total and direct bilirubin concentrations were 10.2±1.7mg/dl and 5.0±1.9mg/dl, respectively. After 2, 4, 8, 24, and 48h, total bilirubin concentrations were 10.1±1.8, 10.0±1.8, 10.0±1.8, 9.3±2.0 (p>0.05, n=20), and 8.4±2.3 (p<0.01, n=20) mg/dl and direct bilirubin concentrations were 4.9±1.8, 4.9±1.9, 4.8±1.8, 4.2±1.6 (p>0.05, n=20), and 3.5±1.5 (p<0.01, n=20) mg/dl. For samples with normal bilirubin levels under the same conditions, the average baseline total and direct bilirubin concentrations were 0.7±0.1mg/dl and below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ), respectively. After 2, 4, 8, 24, and 48h, the average total bilirubin concentrations were 0.7±0.1, 0.6±0.1, 0.6±0.1 (p>0.05, n=20), 0.5±0.1, and 0.4±0.1mg/dl (p<0.01, n=20) and direct bilirubin concentrations were still below LLOQ.
Conclusions
Bilirubin in plasma is stable in refrigerator or at room temperature without light exposure for at least 24h. In normal laboratory environment, a delay of up to 8h in the measurement of bilirubin left unprotected from light at room temperature does not significantly affect the results. Under these conditions, the changes in bilirubin concentration are not clinically significant until 24h (direct bilirubin) and after 48h (total bilirubin).},

  abstract      = {Background: Exposure to drugs of abuse is frequently assessed using urine drug screening (UDS) immunoassays. Although fast and relatively inexpensive, UDS assays often cross-react with unrelated compounds, which can lead to false-positive results and impair patient care. The current process of identifying cross-reactivity relies largely on case reports, making it sporadic and inefficient, and rendering knowledge of cross-reactivity incomplete. Here, we present a systematic approach to discover cross-reactive substances using data from electronic health records (EHRs).Methods: Using our institution{\textquoteright}s EHR data, we assembled a data set of 698651 UDS results across 10 assays and linked each UDS result to the corresponding individual{\textquoteright}s previous medication exposures. We hypothesized that exposure to a cross-reactive ingredient would increase the odds of a false-positive screen. For 2201 assay{\textendash} ingredient pairs, we quantified potential cross-reactivity as an odds ratio from logistic regression. We then evaluated cross-reactivity experimentally by spiking the ingredient or its metabolite into drug-free urine and testing the spiked samples on each assay.Results: Our approach recovered multiple known cross-reactivities. After accounting for concurrent exposures to multiple ingredients, we selected 18 compounds (13 parent drugs and 5 metabolites) to evaluate experimentally. We validated 12 of 13 tested assay{\textendash}ingredient pairs expected to show cross-reactivity by our analysis, discovering previously unknown cross-reactivities affecting assays for amphetamines, buprenorphine, cannabinoids, and methadone.Conclusions: Our findings can help laboratorians and providers interpret presumptive positive UDS results. Our data-driven approach can serve as a model for high-throughput discovery of substances that interfere with laboratory tests.},

Clinical decisions in patients with monoclonal gammopathies may be highly imprecise because of variations of parameters used in diagnosis. In this study, we aimed to calculate the variation in M-protein, free light chains (FLCs), and immunoglobulins in respective patients.
Design & methods
We analyzed the data of clinically stable patients with monoclonal gammopathy (MG), which were monitored for 7-years to determine the biological variations and reference change values (RCV) of serum M-protein, monoclonal serum FLCs and immunoglobulin (Ig) concentrations. Patients that were included in the study had no change in diagnosis and showed <5 g/L change in serum M-protein during the monitoring. From the patients included at least 3 consecutive samples were analyzed within 8 months and 7 years of initial diagnosis.
Results
The total coefficient of variations (CV) was calculated for M-protein and involved/uninvolved fractions of FLCs and immunoglobulins. From 38 patients and 456 samples that were included in the study, the total CVs were calculated for serial M-proteins (8.9%), serum involved FLCs (iFLC, 21.4%), involved Ig (i-Ig, 8.7%) and uninvolved Ig (u-Ig, 9.1%). Combining these CVs and the interassay analytical CVs, we calculated the biological CV for the serum M-protein (8.4%), serum iFLC concentration (21.1%), i-Ig (8.6%) and u-Ig (9.0%). A significant correlation was found in multiple myeloma patients between the κ/λ light chain ratio (rFLC) with i-Ig, the difference between i-Ig level and u-Ig level (d-Ig) and ratio Ig (r-Ig) (r = 0.790, 0.703 and 0.711, respectively). These correlations were not found in patients suffering from MG of undetermined significance and smoldering multiple myeloma.
Conclusions
i-Ig determinations may be an alternative to M-protein for MGs. The variations in serum FLC measurements during MG monitoring were greater than those observed in serum M-proteins and therefore need to be more rigorously revised for recommendations.},

  abstract      = {Infertility is a disease characterized by the failure to establish a clinical pregnancy after 12 months of regular and unprotected sexual intercourse. It is estimated to affect between 8 and 12% of reproductive-aged couples worldwide. Males are found to be solely responsible for 20–30% of infertility cases but contribute to 50% of cases overall. Secondary infertility is the most common form of female infertility around the globe, often due to reproductive tract infections. The three major factors influencing the spontaneous probability of conception are the time of unwanted non-conception, the age of the female partner and the disease-related infertility. The chance of becoming spontaneously pregnant declines with the duration before conception. The fertility decline in female already starts around 25–30 years of age and the median age at last birth is 40–41 years in most studied populations experiencing natural fertility. The disease-related infertility may affect both genders or be specific to one gender. The factors affecting both genders' fertility are hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism, hyperprolactinemia, disorders of ciliary function, cystic fibrosis, infections, systemic diseases and lifestyle related factors/diseases. Premature ovarian insufficiency, polycystic ovary syndrome, endometriosis, uterine fibroids and endometrial polyps may play a role in female infertility. Male infertility may be due to testicular and post-testicular deficiencies. Semen decline that has been observed over the years, endocrine disrupting chemicals and consanguinity are other factors that may be involved.},

The uncertainty associated with each step of the traceability chain should be governed to obtain a final combined uncertainty on clinical samples fulfilling the requested performance specifications. It is important that end-users (i.e., clinical laboratory) may know and verify how in vitro diagnostics (IVD) manufacturers have implemented the traceability of their calibrators and estimated the corresponding uncertainty. However, full information about traceability and combined uncertainty of calibrators is currently very difficult to obtain. Laboratory professionals should investigate the need to reduce the uncertainty of the higher order metrological references and/or to increase the precision of commercial measuring systems. Accordingly, the measurement uncertainty should not be considered a parameter to be calculated by clinical laboratories just to fulfil the accreditation standards, but it must become a key quality indicator to describe both the performance of an IVD measuring system and the laboratory itself.},

We investigated the necessity of preanalytic acidification in crystallized and noncrystallized urine. We obtained 60 urine samples from routine urine analysis. The basal pH was measured in 30 mL of each sample using Orion 2-star benchtop pH meter (Thermo Scientific, MA). Then, 10 mL of nonacidified samples were separated; 20-mL urine samples were acidified using 12 mol/L hydrochloric acid until pH 1-2; 10 mL acidified urine was analyzed immediately, and the other 10 mL incubated 1 hour at room temperature before analysis. Urine calcium, phosphate, and magnesium concentration were measured using Modular P800 (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and compared in nonacidified, acidified, and acidified after 1 hour incubation samples. Crystals were examined in all samples using light microscopy. Of the samples, 45 (75\\%) were noncrystallized, while 15 (25\\%) were crystallized. Eight samples contained amorphous and 4 contained calcium oxalate crystals;3 had mixed crystals. Three samples containing uric acid crystals were included in the noncrystallized group because uric acid concentration was not considered in this study. Without crystal in urine, the agreement between nonacidified samples and acidified samples, as well as nonacidified and acidified samples after 1 hour incubation, was excellent (calcium, ICC = 0.996, 0.997; phosphate, ICC = 0.999, 0.999; magnesium, ICC = 0.991, 0.985). In the presence of crystal, the agreement between nonacidified samples and acidified samples, as well as nonacidified and acidified samples after 1 hour incubation, was slightly lower than the noncrystallized group but still very good (calcium, ICC = 0.984, 0.981; phosphate, ICC = 0.993, 0.994; magnesium, ICC = 0.945, 0.935).

This is easily demonstrated by using solutions with different concentrations of these three substances.The two secondary peaks of the oxyhaemoglobin spectrum at 540 nm and 577 nm are used as reference to minimize these interferences. Those peaks have the same absorbance as at 456 nm in the oxyhaemoglobin spectrum, independent of its concentration. This wavelength is very close to the maximum absorption of bilirubin and, therefore, is suitable for estimating the net bilirubin absorbance.A preliminary study with 48 spectrophotometric analyses of CSF from patients who were suspected of having subarachnoid haemorrhage were used to compare both net bilirubin absorbance estimation methods.The new method is practically free of oxyhaemoglobin and biliverdin interference. This allows for higher sensitivity and a more realistic estimation of the bilirubin concentration in a sample.A better estimation of the bilirubin concentration can have special relevance for diminishing the amount of equivocal or inconclusive cases and also to improve the prematurity of the diagnosis. },

Whether the increase is caused by irritation of the vessel wall or diurnal variation is unknown. We therefore compared the effects of a PV catheter and repeated venepunctures on markers of coagulation, inflammation, and endothelial function.A PV catheter was inserted at 07:45 in a hand vein in 10 healthy subjects, and blood samples were collected at 8:00, 10:00, 12:00, and 14:00. In the contralateral arm, blood was simultaneously obtained by venepunctures. Measures of coagulation, i.e., activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT), fibrinogen, prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F1 + 2) and thrombin-antithrombin (TAT), inflammation, i.e., interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP), and endothelial function, i.e., plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), von Willebrand factor (vWF), and tissue factor (TF) were measured in plasma.The concentrations of TAT and F1 + 2 were significantly increased (10:00; p < .01, 12:00; p < .05, and 14:00; p < .01) in PV catheter samples compared with venepuncture samples. There was a minor increase in PT and INR and no increase in APTT, fibrinogen, CRP, PAI-1, tPA, vWF, and TF, with no differences between sampling methods. IL-6 concentrations increased in many PV catheter samples and venepuncture samples, but the response varied between the subjects.Blood collection through a PV catheter induces coagulation activation, whereas endothelial function is not affected. More studies are needed to disclose the effect of blood sampling on IL-6. },

In practice, either the direct application of the propagation of uncertainty in measurement equation or a Monte Carlo simulation procedure using a readily available spreadsheet may be used to evaluate uncertainty in measurement or the propagation of biological variation. If the only recognised “uncertainty” is the biological variation in the measured serum creatinine, the equation for the propagation of uncertainties in measurement for the eGFR simplifies to an expression in which the coefficient of variation of the eGFR (or the biological variation of the eGFR) is directly proportional to the coefficient of variation of the measured serum creatinine (or the biological variation of the serum creatinine).},

  abstract      = {Background: Serum testosterone remains the most important investigation in the diagnosis of androgen deficiency in men. Most of the circulating testosterone is bound to albumin and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), whereas free testosterone accounts for approximately 2% of total testosterone. Because direct measurement of free testosterone is impractical in routine practice, several equations are used to provide clinically useful estimates of free testosterone concentration. This study aimed to (1) obtain locally derived reference limits for total testosterone and calculated free testosterone (CFT) concentrations, and (2) critically evaluate the equations commonly used to estimate free testosterone.Methods: Serum total testosterone, SHBG and albumin were assayed in morning blood samples obtained from 126 healthy men (aged 20-45 years) known to have normal semen analysis. CFT concentrations calculated using four published methods (i.e. the Sodergard, Nanjee-Wheeler, Vermeulen and Ly-Handelsman equations) were compared with one another and the free androgen index.Results: Reference intervals for total testosterone and CFT by the Vermeulen equation were 9.4-31.0 nmol/L and 0.245-0.785 nmol/L (2.5-97.5 percentile), respectively. CFT values varied considerably with the four equations examined. Mean biases ranged from 5.8 to 56.0%; the Nanjee-Wheeler and Ly-Handelsman equations yielded positive and negative biases, respectively, against the other equations. Free androgen index was shown to correlate poorly with CFT (r2 = 0.21-0.46) and over-estimate the CFT at low SHBG concentrations.Conclusions: We have used various equations to derive reference ranges for CFT in healthy men aged 20-45 years. We suggest that CFT be incorporated into the investigation regimen for suspected hypogonadism when total testosterone results are equivocal.},

  abstract      = {Background: Measuring 24 h-urine calcium concentration
is essential to evaluate calcium metabolism and excretion.
Manufacturers recommend acidifying the urine before a
measurement to ensure calcium solubility, but the literature
offers controversial information on this pre-analytical
treatment. The objectives of the study were (1) to compare
pre-acidification (during urine collection) versus postacidification
(in the laboratory), and (2) to evaluate the
impact of acidification on urinary calcium measurements
in a large cohort.
Methods: We evaluated the effects of pre- and post-acidification
on 24-h urine samples collected from 10 healthy
volunteers. We further studied the impact of acidification
on the calcium results for 567 urine samples from
routine laboratory practice, including 46 hypercalciuria
(≥7.5 mmol/24 h) samples.
Results: Calciuria values in healthy volunteers ranged
from 0.6 to 12.5 mmol/24 h, and no statistical significance
was found between non-acidified, pre-acidified and postacidified
conditions. A comparison of the values (ranging
from 0.21 to 29.32 mmol/L) for 567 urine samples before
and after acidification indicated 25 samples (4.4%) with
analytical differences outside limits of acceptance. The
bias observed for these deviant values ranged from −3.07
to 1.32 mmol/L; no patient was re-classified as hypercalciuric
after acidification, and three patients with hypercalciuria
were classified as normocalciuric after acidification.
These three deviant patients represent 6.5% of
hypercalciuric patients.
Conclusions: Our results indicate that pre- and post-acidification
of urine is not necessary prior to routine calcium
analysis.

Evaluate the level of interference of biochemists dosages in the 24-hour urine using or not the 6mol/l HCl acid in different concentrations and conditions and its implications in the most demanded analytes in clinical laboratory.
Methods
Twenty-two volunteers collected three 24-hour urine in 3 conditions: with 5ml/l and 20ml/l of 6mol/l HCl in the container, and without acid preservative. The samples collected without preservative were separated in aliquots and added 5ml/l of 6mol/l HCl after 24h. Analytes, uric acid creatinine, urea, chlorides, glucose, magnesium, sodium, potassium, microalbumin, proteins, amylase, aldosterone, calcium, cortisol, phosphorus, citric acid, oxalate, and metanephrines, were determined.
Results
Uric acid, glucose, microalbumin, protein, amylase and aldosterone showed that %CV ranging from 16 to 57% in the presence of acid preservative. Analytes that need acid preservative cortisol, citric acid and oxalate showed %CV ranging from 6 to 27% with r=0.66, r=0.77, r=0.70 respectively provided 5ml/l after delivery and r=0.31, r=0.70 and r=0.48 without preservative acid when compared with the gold standard (with 20ml/l of 6mol/l HCl).
Conclusions
Glucose, microalbumin, protein, amylase and aldosterone urinary did not show good performance in the presence of acid preservative. Analytes that need acid preservative showed variation acceptable in condition 5ml/l of 6mol/l HCl added after 24h.},

  abstract      = {Metabolic evaluation of stone-forming (SF) patients is based on the determination of calcium, oxalate, citrate, uric acid and other parameters in 24-h urine samples under a random diet. A reliable measurement of urinary oxalate requires the collection of urine in a receptacle containing acid preservative. However, urinary uric acid cannot be determined in the same sample under this condition. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that the addition of preservatives (acid or alkali) after urine collection would not modify the results of those lithogenic parameters. Thirty-four healthy subjects (HS) were submitted to two non-consecutive collections of 24-h urine. The first sample was collected in a receptacle containing hydrochloric acid (HCl 6 N) and the second in a dry plastic container, with HCl being added as soon as the urine sample was received at the laboratory. Additionally, 34 HS and 34 SF patients collected a spot urine sample that was divided into four aliquots, one containing HCl, another containing sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3 5 g/l), and two others in which these two preservative agents were added 24 h later. Urinary oxalate, calcium, magnesium, citrate, creatinine and uric acid were determined. Urinary parameters were also evaluated in the presence of calcium oxalate or uric acid crystals. Mean values of all urinary parameters obtained from previously acidified 24-h urine samples did not differ from those where acid was added after urine collection. The same was true for spot urine samples, with the exception of urinary citrate that presented a slight albeit significant change of 5.9{\%} between samples in HS and 3.1{\%} in SF. Uric acid was also not different between pre- and post-alkalinized spot urine samples. The presence of crystals did not alter these results. We concluded that post-delivery acidification or alkalinization of urine samples does not modify the measured levels of urinary oxalate, calcium, magnesium, creatinine and uric acid, and that the change on citrate was not relevant, hence allowing all parameters to be determined in a single urine sample, thus avoiding the inconvenience and cost of multiple 24-h urine sample collections.},

24-h urine measurements are used in the routine diagnosis and follow-up of many diseases in the clinical laboratory. Calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), phosphate (PO43−) and uric acid are frequently requested markers in 24-h urine samples. Because of the different solubilities of these parameters, different urine collection conditions – urine in base for uric acid and urine in acid for Ca2+, PO43− and Mg2+ measurements – are recommended.
Methods
We aimed to test the effect of addition of preservatives and heating of the urine specimen on the results obtained for Ca2+, Mg2+, PO43− and uric acid by comparison with untreated samples results. Spot (n=20) and 24-h urine (n=50) samples were obtained from patients for routine urine analysis. A single spot urine sample was divided into five aliquots of 10 mL each: one containing 200 µL of HCl (6 N), another containing 200 µL of sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO3 (5 g/L), two others in which the same preservative agents were added 24 h after the collection, and one without any preservative (untreated). Ca2+, PO43−, uric acid and Mg2+ were measured in triplicate and at three different time points during the study: at the time of sampling (0 h), 24 h after sampling, and after heating the samples. The 24-h urine samples were collected without preservatives and analytes were measured promptly before and after acidification/alkalinization.
Results
There was no statistically significant difference between untreated and treated samples (p>0.05). Heating also failed to show any difference in the results (p>0.05).
Conclusion
According to our results, addition of preservatives is not necessary for measurement of Ca2+, Mg2+, PO43− and uric acid in promptly assayed 24-h urine samples.},

Chemically pure standards of the β-O-glucuronide of ethylene glycol (EG-GLUC) and a deuterated analog (d4-EG-GLUC) were synthesized. A high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry method for determination of EG-GLUC in serum after ultrafiltration was validated. Inter-assay precision (\%RSD) was 3.9\% to 15.1\% and inter-assay \%bias was −2.8\% to 12.2\%. The measuring range was 2–100 μmol/L (0.48–24 mg/L). Specificity testing showed no endogenous amounts in routine clinical samples (n = 40). The method was used to analyze authentic, clinical serum samples (n = 31) from patients intoxicated with ethylene glycol. EG-GLUC was quantified in 15 of these samples, with a mean concentration of 6.5 μmol/L (1.6 mg/L), ranging from 2.3 to 15.6 μmol/L (0.55 to 3.7 mg/L). In five samples, EG-GLUC was detected below the limit of quantification (2 μmol/L) and it was below the limit of detection in 11 samples (1 μmol/L). Compared to the millimolar concentrations of ethylene glycol present in blood after intoxications and potentially available for conjugation, the concentrations of EG-GLUC found in clinical serum samples are very low, but comparable to concentrations of ethyl glucuronide after medium dose ethanol intake. In theory, EG-GLUC has a potential value as a biomarker for ethylene glycol intake, but the pharmacokinetic properties, in vivo/vitro stability and the biosynthetic pathways of EG-GLUC must be further studied in a larger number of patients and other biological matrices.},

It is appropriate to distinguish between uncertainty determined under repeatability and reproducibility conditions, and to distinguish causes of variation using analysis of variance components. The intra-laboratory MU is frequently determined by repeated measurements of control material(s) of one or several concentrations during a prolonged period of time. We demonstrate, based on experimental results, how such results can be used to identify the repeatability, ‘pure’ reproducibility and intra-laboratory variance as the sum of the two. Native patient material was used to establish repeatability using the Dahlberg formula for random differences between measurements and an expanded Dahlberg formula if a non-random difference, e.g. bias, was expected. Repeatability and reproducibility have different clinical relevance in intensive care compared to monitoring treatment of chronic diseases, comparison with reference intervals or screening. },

The performance of calprotectin and PCT as sepsis and prognostic markers for 30-d mortality was compared in a prospective, observational study in an eight-bed ICU. We investigated concentrations of the biomarkers in plasma collected at admission from all ICU patients admitted during a year (2012–2013, n = 271) together with simplified acute physiology 3 scores (SAPS3) and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed a higher area under the curve (AUC) value for calprotectin (0.79) than for PCT (0.49) when used as a sepsis marker. The calprotectin concentrations at admission were higher in non-survivors than in survivors at day 30. In our study, calprotectin was superior to PCT for distinguishing between ICU patients with sepsis and non-sepsis patients. Calprotectin also had higher predictive ability regarding 30-d mortality. },

  abstract      = { AbstractMeasurement imprecision is usually calculated from measurement results of the same stabilized control material(s) obtained over time, and is therefore, principally, only valid at the concentration(s) of the selected control material(s). The resulting uncertainty has been obtained under reproducibility conditions and corresponds to the conventional analytical goals. Furthermore, the commutability of the control materials used determines whether the imprecision calculated from the control materials reflects the imprecision of measuring patient samples. Imprecision estimated by measurements of patient samples uses fully commutable samples, freely available in the laboratories. It is commonly performed by calculating the results of routine patient samples measured twice each. Since the duplicates are usually analysed throughout the entire concentration interval of the patient samples processed in the laboratory, the result will be a weighted average of the repeatability imprecision measured in the chosen measurement intervals or throughout the entire interval of concentrations encountered in patient care. In contrast, the uncertainty derived from many measurements of control materials over periods of weeks is usually made under reproducibility conditions. Consequently, the repeatability and reproducibility imprecision play different roles in the inference of results in clinical medicine. The purpose of the present review is to detail the properties of the imprecision calculated by duplicates of natural samples, to explain how it differs from imprecision calculated from single concentrations of control materials, and to elucidate what precautions need to be taken in case of bias, e.g. due to carry-over effects. },

Introduction—Professional mountain guides face significant occupational health risks, including
injuries, accidents, environmental exposures, chronic musculoskeletal strain, and psychological stressors.
This study aims to investigate these risks and their impact on the quality of life of a group of international
British mountain guides.
Methods—This self-reported online survey included demographics; acute and chronic occupational conditions;
and questions on general health, lifestyle, symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and
quality of life based on theWorld Health Organization quality of life [WHOQOL-BREF] questionnaire.
Results—Responses were received from 67 (32%) of the approached guides. Knee pain (75%), back
and neck pain (62%), hand/upper extremity problems (51%), and lower limb injuries (49%) were the
most commonly reported individual occupational health problems. Chronic eye problems were reported
by 8%, and 5% reported skin cancer. Twenty-nine percent were on regular medications, which were
mainly analgesics for chronic musculoskeletal complaints. Mountain guides have a healthy lifestyle, with
lower rates of being overweight/obese, alcohol consumption, and smoking than the average UK
population. Fourteen (61%) of the 23 guides responding to the PTSD questions reported experiencing
life-threatening traumatic incidents, and 4 (25%) of this subgroup appear to have had some symptoms of
PTSD. The quality of life assessment showed that the studied mountain guides have a high quality of life.
Conclusions—Musculoskeletal problems are the main occupational health problems experienced by
the study group. New findings include a low but important prevalence of ultraviolet radiationassociated
conditions. One in 3 guides have experienced significant psychological trauma, and one quarter of
these had symptoms of PTSD.

  abstract      = {Introduction To evaluate the rewarming effectiveness of a similar amount of heat (from a charcoal heater) applied to either the head or torso in a human model for severe hypothermia in which shivering is pharmacologically inhibited in mildly hypothermic subjects. Methods Six male subjects were cooled on 3 different occasions, each in 8°C water for 60 min, or to a lowest core temperature of 35°C. Shivering was inhibited by intravenous meperidine (1.5 mg·kg−1), administered during the last 10 min of the cold-water immersion. Subjects then exited from the cold water, were dried, and were placed in a 3-season sleeping bag for 120 min in one of the following conditions: spontaneous rewarming only, charcoal heater on the head, or charcoal heater on the torso. Supplemental meperidine (to a maximum cumulative dose of 3.3 mg·kg−1) was administered as required during rewarming to suppress shivering. Results No significant differences were found in the postcooling afterdrop amount or core rewarming rates among the 3 conditions (0.8°C·h−1). During the last 30 min of rewarming the net heat gain was significantly higher in the head (85.8±25.3 W) and torso (81.5±6.3 W) conditions compared with the spontaneous condition (56.9±12 W) (P<0.05). Conclusions In our study, head and torso warming had the same core rewarming rates when shivering was pharmacologically inhibited in mildly hypothermic subjects. Therefore, in nonshivering cold subjects, head warming is a viable alternative if torso warming is contraindicated (eg, when performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation or working on open chest wounds).},
