två HbA1c-prov ≥48 mmol/mol
eller ett prov ≥48 mmol/mol
samtidigt som P-glukos (fastande
eller efter glukosbelastning)
är över gränsen för diabetes.
Då hyperglykemisymtom eller
kort diabetesduration misstänks
ska HbA1c inte användas för
diagnostik.
Vissa sjukdomar och viss medicinering
påverkar HbA1c-värdet.
HbA1c <48 mmol/mol utesluter
inte diabetes.

  abstract  = {Objective: An increase in numbers of cases of sick leave due to stress have been reported from several European countries during recent decades. Chronic stress-induced exhaustion disorder is associated with physiological and neurobiological perturbations that may contribute to cognitive problems and long-term exhaustion. Rehabilitation of patients with 
chronic stress-induced exhaustion disorder is therefore challenging. This narrative review summarizes the evidence regarding the effectiveness of different interventions for the rehabilitation of patients with chronic stress-induced exhaustion disorder.

Methods: Both structured and unstructured searches of research studies and reports were performed in order to find knowledge sources. The structured search had 2 predefined inclusion criteria: (i) chronic 
stress-induced exhaustion/clinical burnout/severe burnout/stress-induced exhaustion; and (ii) rehabil-itation with improvement of symptoms and/or 
return to work as outcomes.

Results: Cognitive behavioural interventions and multimodal interventions seem to reduce symptoms. Workplace interventions, either work-focused cognitive behavioural or workplace dialogue, seem to improve return to work. Sleep is important for both symptom improvement and return to work, and interventions for improving sleep might therefore be important. For improvement of cognitive function, which is a main complaint among patients with chronic stress-induced exhaustion disorder, aerobic and cognitive training may have some effect.

Conclusion: In summary, the few studies of high-quality that examine
interventions for rehabilitation of chronic stress-induced exhaustion
disorder show only marginal effects. Thus, it is important to prevent
the onset of chronic stress-induced exhaustion disorder.},

  abstract = { Background:Recent US practice guidelines and laboratory regulations for quality control (QC) emphasize the development of QC plans and the application of risk management principles. The US Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) now includes an option to comply with QC regulations by developing an individualized QC plan (IQCP) based on a risk assessment of the total testing process. The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) has provided new practice guidelines for application of risk management to QC plans and statistical QC (SQC).Methods:We describe an alternative approach for developing a total QC plan (TQCP) that includes a risk-based SQC procedure. CLIA compliance is maintained by analyzing at least 2 levels of controls per day. A Sigma-Metric SQC Run Size nomogram provides a graphical tool to simplify the selection of risk-based SQC procedures.Applications:Current HbA1c method performance, as demonstrated by published method validation studies, is estimated to be 4-Sigma quality at best. Optimal SQC strategies require more QC than the CLIA minimum requirement of 2 levels per day. More complex control algorithms, more control measurements, and a bracketed mode of operation are needed to assure the intended quality of results.Conclusions:A total QC plan with a risk-based SQC procedure provides a simpler alternative to an individualized QC plan. A Sigma-Metric SQC Run Size nomogram provides a practical tool for selecting appropriate control rules, numbers of control measurements, and run size (or frequency of SQC). Applications demonstrate the need for continued improvement of analytical performance of HbA1c laboratory methods. },

In the world of metrology – the science of measurement and its application – there is a language which has to be learned. The International Vocabulary of Metrology (VIM) was produced to provide a common language, primarily for physical measurements. The third edition (International Vocabulary of Metrology – Basic and General Concepts and Associated Terms (VIM 3) was published in 2007. There are many differences between VIM 3 and earlier editions; one important change is captured in the title with the addition of the word ‘concepts’. The VIM 3 is a consistent set of concepts each described by a unique term, the ‘label’ of the concept. VIM 3 is applicable across all scientific disciplines thus making it relevant to those involved in performing measurements in chemistry and biology. Consistent definitions of concepts with their associated terms and symbols are essential if analysts and customers across the globe are to understand each other.

This Eurachem Guide discusses a selection of the concepts in VIM 3, focusing on those most likely to be encountered in analytical laboratories. It aims to cover chemical, biological and clinical measurements and gives examples over and above those in the notes accompanying the definitions in VIM 3. The guide is intended for laboratory staff, accreditation bodies, for those commissioning measurements and for those using measurement results. Lecturers and trainers may also find this guide useful when teaching aspects of metrology.

A computerized tomography (CT) scan is positive in up to 98\% of patients with SAH presenting within 12 h, but is positive in only 50\% of those presenting within one week. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) bilirubin spectrophotometry can be used to determine the need for angiography in those few CT-negative patients in whom clinical suspicion of SAH remains high; it may remain positive up to two weeks after the event. A lumbar puncture (LP) should only be performed >12 h after the onset of presenting symptoms. Whenever possible collect sequential specimens. Always ensure that the least blood-stained CSF sample taken (usually the last) is sent for bilirubin analysis. Protect the CSF from light and avoid vacuum tube transport systems, if possible. Always use spectrophotometry in preference to visual inspection. All CSF specimens are precious and should always be analysed unless insufficient sample is received. Centrifuge the specimen at >2000 rpm for 5 min as soon as possible after receipt in the laboratory. Store the supernatant at 4°C in the dark until analysis. An increase in CSF bilirubin is the key finding, which supports the occurrence of SAH but is not specific for this. In most positive cases, bilirubin will occur with oxyhaemoglobin. },

Although the traditional classification of the coagulation system into extrinsic and intrinsic pathway is still valid, the newer insights into coagulation provide more authentic description of the same. Normal coagulation pathway represents a balance between the pro coagulant pathway that is responsible for clot formation and the mechanisms that inhibit the same beyond the injury site. Imbalance of the coagulation system may occur in the perioperative period or during critical illness, which may be secondary to numerous factors leading to a tendency of either thrombosis or bleeding. A systematic search of literature on PubMed with MeSH terms 'coagulation system, haemostasis and anaesthesia revealed twenty eight related clinical trials and review articles in last 10 years. Since the balance of the coagulation system may tilt towards bleeding and thrombosis in many situations, it is mandatory for the clinicians to understand physiologic basis of haemostasis in order to diagnose and manage the abnormalities of the coagulation process and to interpret the diagnostic tests done for the same.},

  abstract  = {Night shift work is associated with adverse health effects, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie this association is instrumental in advancing the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of shift work-related health concerns. We characterized the effect on genome-wide gene expression levels of a 4-day protocol simulating night shifts in healthy human subjects under highly controlled laboratory conditions. We demonstrate that this night shift protocol leads to a dampening of gene expression rhythms and a desynchrony between rhythmic transcripts and the shifted sleep/wake cycle. Moreover, we uncovered key biological processes and regulatory molecules that are altered during this night shift protocol and that may contribute to the development of health problems on the long term.Misalignment of the endogenous circadian timing system leads to disruption of physiological rhythms and may contribute to the development of the deleterious health effects associated with night shift work. However, the molecular underpinnings remain to be elucidated. Here, we investigated the effect of a 4-day simulated night shift work protocol on the circadian regulation of the human transcriptome. Repeated blood samples were collected over two 24-hour measurement periods from eight healthy subjects under highly controlled laboratory conditions before and 4 days after a 10-hour delay of their habitual sleep period. RNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells to obtain transcriptomic data. Cosinor analysis revealed a marked reduction of significantly rhythmic transcripts in the night shift condition compared with baseline at group and individual levels. Subsequent analysis using a mixed-effects model selection approach indicated that this decrease is mainly due to dampened rhythms rather than to a complete loss of rhythmicity: 73\% of transcripts rhythmically expressed at baseline remained rhythmic during the night shift condition with a similar phase relative to habitual bedtimes, but with lower amplitudes. Functional analysis revealed that key biological processes are affected by the night shift protocol, most notably the natural killer cell-mediated immune response and Jun/AP1 and STAT pathways. These results show that 4 days of simulated night shifts leads to a loss in temporal coordination between the human circadian transcriptome and the external environment and impacts biological processes related to the adverse health effects associated to night shift work.},

  abstract  = {Nighttime napping is an effective measure to prevent adverse effects due to night shift work. A characteristic of nighttime nap is that it can result in considerably deeper sleep. Several studies have shown that taking nighttime naps suppressed increasing sleepiness, decreasing alertness during the period following awaking from a nap, and prevented disturbance of circadian rhythm (“anchor sleep”). The length of daytime sleep after night shift, when combined with a nighttime nap, is shorter than that without nap. This finding might be interpreted as a beneficial effect rather than a negative feature because workers can then spend time engaged in other activities rather than sleeping. Nevertheless, the introduction of nighttime sleep break in the workplace has not been widely accepted. To promote nighttime napping strategy in the workplace, consensus building while acting on conflicting interest is essential. Recently, participatory method for improvement of working condition has expanded worldwide. A characteristic of the activity is using action checklist and group work, and heightening motivation to improvement working condition between worker and manager. Through the activities, nighttime napping strategy would be spread more in the workplaces and play a role as one of the effective tools for improving working conditions, work performance and safety in the future.},

Sixty male students, classified as M-types or E-types by the Japanese version morningness-eveningness questionnaire, were recruited for this study. Five moderate M-types and eight moderate E-types were selected. Their MEQ scores were 32-41 (average 36.9) in E-types and 60-64 (average 62.4) in M-types, respectively. Experiment periods were simulated shift schedules of 9 consecutive days consisting of 2 d shifts (working 8:00-16:00), 3 night shifts (working 22:00-8:00) and 3 d shifts. They carried out two series of experiments. In one series the subjects took a nap from 2:00 to 4:00. In the other series they did not take a nap during the night shift. In order to minimize the effect of the previous experiments, a rest period of more than one week was inserted between the nap-condition and the no-nap condition experiments. During the shifts, the subjects repeatedly performed two kinds of tasks: typing figures listed randomly on sheets into a computer for 20 min; and after a 5 min break performing mental arithmetic with two adjacent figures, listed randomly on the sheets, for 15 min. During the breaks, psycho-physiological functions and questionnaires on subjective feelings of fatigue and index of the state of anxiety were examined. Throughout the experiments, heart rate variability was also recorded with a portable recorder to evaluate autonomic nerve activity. Task performances decreased and subjective feelings of fatigue and anxiety scores increased in proportion to the length of time worked in both M-types and E-types who had no nap. In M-types, these changes were significantly suppressed by the nap on the first night of duty. Parasympathetic nerve activity for M-types estimated from heart rate variability between 4:00 and 6:00 under nap conditions decreased significantly compared with that under no-nap conditions. Overall changes for E-types, however, were smaller than those for M-types in terms of task performance and psycho-physiological parameters. The present study suggested that taking a nighttime nap was an effective way to reduce adverse effects due to first nocturnal work, especially for M-types.},

  abstract  = { BackgroundThe dilution or adulteration of urine is a serious problem in drugs of abuse testing. Tests to identify adulteration are currently available. This study investigated the ability of the CEDIA® sample check to detect adulteration.MethodsEight different drugs of abuse were added to a urine sample obtained from a healthy, drug-free subject: 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP), 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, benzoylecgonine, D-amphetamine sulphate, ethyl-D-glucuronide, morphine sulphate, oxazepam, (-)-11-nor-9-carboxy-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol. Urine samples were diluted to yield three samples of drugs of abuse concentrations close to general cut-offs as used in methadone treatment centres, by health authorities for psychological tests and in traffic medicine. Aspirin, citric acid, CrO3, H2O2, soap, sodium metaborate, vitamin C were added in three, HCl and NaOH in one, and NaN3 in two concentrations. All samples were measured with commercially available immunological assays shortly after sample preparation and 24 h later. All samples were further analysed with the CEDIA® sample check reaction which may identify adulteration.ResultsOxidizing reagents (H2O2 or CrO3) are most effective in interfering in the measurement of benzoylecgonine, EDDP, ethyl-D-glucuronide and morphine sulphate. The measurement of (-)-11-nor-9-carboxy-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol is affected by many adulterants. Adulteration with HCl and NaOH was identified with the sample check reaction. NaN3 generated false negative results for a number of drugs of abuse.ConclusionsUrine samples with drugs of abuse concentrations above cut-offs can be successfully tampered with adulterants in a way which cannot be detected with the CEDIA® sample check assay. },

In the present study, we used a modified culture protocol that included plating larger volumes of urine, incubation under varied atmospheric conditions, and prolonged incubation times to demonstrate that many of the organisms identified in urine by 16S rRNA gene sequencing are, in fact, cultivable using an expanded quantitative urine culture (EQUC) protocol. Sixty-five urine specimens (from 41 patients with overactive bladder and 24 controls) were examined using both the standard and EQUC culture techniques. Fifty-two of the 65 urine samples (80\%) grew bacterial species using EQUC, while the majority of these (48/52 [92\%]) were reported as no growth at 103 CFU/ml by the clinical microbiology laboratory using the standard urine culture protocol. Thirty-five different genera and 85 different species were identified by EQUC. The most prevalent genera isolated were Lactobacillus (15\%), followed by Corynebacterium (14.2\%), Streptococcus (11.9\%), Actinomyces (6.9\%), and Staphylococcus (6.9\%). Other genera commonly isolated include Aerococcus, Gardnerella, Bifidobacterium, and Actinobaculum. Our current study demonstrates that urine contains communities of living bacteria that comprise a resident female urine microbiota.},

The database covers 316 quantities and reviews 191 articles, fewer than 10 of which had to be rejected. The
within- and between-subject coefficients of variation and the subsequent desirable quality specifications for precision, bias and total error for all the quantities accepted are presented. Sex-related stratification of results was justified for only four quantities and, in these cases, quality specifications were derived from the group with lower within-subject variation. For certain quantities, biological variation in pathological states was higher than in the healthy state. In these cases, quality specifications were derived only from the healthy population (most stringent). Several quantities (particularly hormones) have been treated in very few articles and the results found are highly discrepant. Therefore, professionals in laboratory medicine should be strongly encouraged to study the quantities for which results are discrepant, the 90 quantities described in only one paper and the numerous quantities that have not been the subject of study. },

In part, this is aspiration to preserve the format of a paper report in electronic format. It is also due to the limitations of electronic media to display the data. The advancement of web-based technologies and functionality of hand-held devices together with wireless and other technologies afford the opportunity to rethink data presentation with the aim of emphasising the message in the data, thereby modifying clinical behaviours and potentially reducing post-analytical error. This article takes the form of a commentary which explores new developments in the field of infographics and, together with examples, suggests some new approaches to communicating what is currently just data into information. The combination of graphics and a new approach to provocative interpretative commenting offers a powerful tool in improving pathology utilisation. An additional challenge is the requirement to consider how pathology reports may be issued directly to patients.},

  abstract  = {Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are increasingly popular in the social sciences, not only in medicine. We argue that the lay public, and sometimes researchers, put too much trust in RCTs over other methods of investigation. Contrary to frequent claims in the applied literature, randomization does not equalize everything other than the treatment in the treatment and control groups, it does not automatically deliver a precise estimate of the average treatment effect (ATE), and it does not relieve us of the need to think about (observed or unobserved) covariates. Finding out whether an estimate was generated by chance is more difficult than commonly believed. At best, an RCT yields an unbiased estimate, but this property is of limited practical value. Even then, estimates apply only to the sample selected for the trial, often no more than a convenience sample, and justification is required to extend the results to other groups, including any population to which the trial sample belongs, or to any individual, including an individual in the trial. Demanding ‘external validity’ is unhelpful because it expects too much of an RCT while undervaluing its potential contribution. RCTs do indeed require minimal assumptions and can operate with little prior knowledge. This is an advantage when persuading distrustful audiences, but it is a disadvantage for cumulative scientific progress, where prior knowledge should be built upon, not discarded. RCTs can play a role in building scientific knowledge and useful predictions but they can only do so as part of a cumulative program, combining with other methods, including conceptual and theoretical development, to discover not ‘what works’, but ‘why things work’.},

  abstract  = {We suggest here a pragmatic approach for managing results of clinical chemistry testing in hemolyzed samples collected from adults/older children, attempting to balance the need to produce quality laboratory data with clinical urgency of releasing test results. Automatic measurement of the hemolysis index (H-index) in serum or plasma is highly advisable, whilst low-quality assessment of this test remains less good than a visual inspection. Regarding its practical use, when the H-index value does not generate an analytically significant bias, results can be released, whilst when the value is associated with analyte variation in a range between analytically and clinically significant bias (i.e. variation does not exceed the reference change value [RCV]), results of hemolysis-sensitive tests can be released in association with a comment describing the direction in which data are potentially altered, suggesting the need to collect another sample. When the H-index is associated with analyte variation exceeding clinically significant bias (i.e. variation exceeds the RCV), results of hemolysis-sensitive tests should be suppressed and replaced with a comment that biased results cannot be released because the sample is preanalytically compromised and advising the recollection of another sample. If H-index values reach an even higher critical cut-off (i.e. H-index corresponding to a cell-free hemoglobin concentration ≥10 g/L), all laboratory data may be unreliable and should hence be suppressed and replaced with a comment that all data cannot be released because the sample is grossly hemolyzed, also suggesting the recollection of another sample. Due to inaccuracy and imprecision, the use of corrective formulas for adjusting data of hemolysis-sensitive tests is discouraged.

European Journal of Medical Sciences E ur J Med Sci. 2014 Jun ; 1( 2 ): 43 - 5244IntroductionIntroductionIntroductionIntroductionLaboratory data can be affected by manyvariables. A number of diseases result inincreased amounts of chromogens such asbilirubin or hemoglobin, or lipemic particles,which increase the turbidity. These chromogensinterfere with many photometric assays.However, this interference can be quantified bymeans of serum index measurements. Wheninformation related to analytical interferences isnot reported with patient test results, cliniciansmay interpret test results incorrectly and makeunsuitable procedure related to patients.Interference affecting the test results should beunderstood well to give proper clinicaldecisions. When interferences affecting theblood or other samples are properly determinedand standardized, clinical decisions dependingon laboratory test results can be given moreaccurately (1,2). While analytical standards arebeing developed by quality assessment criteria,there are shortcomings in the development ofstandards related to the preanalytical phase.Recently, some recommendations related todefinition of the optimal sample volume, use ofanticoagulant and stabilizer, sample collection,transport and storage, icteric, lipemic, andhemolyzed samples prevention have beenpublished (3). Total laboratory process consistsof preanalytical, analytical and postanalyticalphases. Preanalytic phase is one of the mostimportant components of the medicallaboratory. Quality control studies should bemade for all analytical phases to provide theprecision and accuracy of laboratory test results.Despite the technological advances inlaboratory automation devices anddevelopments in quality control programs,laboratory errors still occur. Prenalytical phaseis the process in which the vast majority oflaboratory errors happen (3,4). Plebani et alreported that the manuscript distribution oflaboratory errors is as such: 68.2% inpreanalytical, 13.3% in analytical and 18.5% inpostanalytical phase. Preanalytical phaseincludes all of the various procedures beforemeasurement of a sample. Preanalytical factorsinclude patient related variables (age, sex, diet,stress, medication … ), sample collection (bloodcollection technique, sample volume,anticoagulant type … ), sample transport andsample preparation procedures. Before analysis,detection of inappropriate sample plays animportant role in the prevention of errorsbecause laboratory errors usually emerge inpreanalytical phase and they can lead to further,inappropriate investigation and treatments. Inaddition, the samples which are rejected due toanalytical interferences will lead to loss of time,labour and supplies, leading to increases in cost(3,5).Up to now, medical laboratories have taken a“ judgment inspection ” approach to endogenousinterferences; the operator decides whether thesample is appropriate or inappropriate. If anabnormal result is obtained, the sample isinspected for visible interferences. Thus,judgment inspections can only detect errorsafter they have been made and identified.Manuel inspection may be performed on everysample before analysis or inspecting samplesthat produce “ suspect ” results. This is very timeconsuming. In addition a normal result does notcreate suspicion. When serum indices areproduced by the instrument, consistentevaluations are made and remove the potentialfor human error and save operator time. Thecosts involved in repeating “ out of limit ” resultsdue to interferences are reduced. The serumindex result reported with the test resultsenables the operate to acknowledge thepresence of interfering substances as thepotential cause of the abnormal result andremoves need to rerun the sample, thusreducing costs. Glick interferographs areproduced for all assays. This is an easilyunderstandable graphical display of theinterference data showing the deviation fromthe original result caused by the interferent. Thelevel of interference producing a clinicallysignificant difference is indicated in Rochepack insert (6-8). In this study, we aimed toevaluate the effectiveness of current serumindices implementations with existingautomated systems for detection ofinterferences which are unrecognized visuallyand to assess their positive and practicaladvantages for routine laboratory processes.

The study wascarried out in accordance with Declaration ofHelsinki.SampleSampleSampleSample CollectionCollectionCollectionCollection andandandand Preparation:Preparation:Preparation:Preparation:Patient samples which were received at thelaboratory for routine analysis were used in thisstudy. Fasting venous blood samples werecollected by using Vacuette ® Standard tubeholder and Vacuette ® 21-gauge, 0.80 × 38 mmmultisample needle (Vacuette ® , Greiner Bio-One, Kremsmunster, Austria) in the morningduring a week. Blood samples were drawn into8 mL serum gel seperator tubes(Vacuette ® Tube Serum Gel Separator ClotActivator 8 mL, Greiner Bio-One,Kremsmunster, Austria)(Ref.No.455071,Lot.No.A120600Y). Blood samples werecentrifuged at 3000 g for ten minutes. Aftercentrifugation, serum samples were inspectedvisually by laboratory technicians during aweek. Visual examination was done by twolaboratory technicians who were informedabout the study. Visual examination wasperformed according to our standardizedcolored photos and they made a consensusabout the doubtful samples according to thisphotos. Consequently, 717 patient sampleswhich were decided visually to not to includeany interferences were reserved for study.These samples freshly analyzed without delay.MeasurementMeasurementMeasurementMeasurement ofofofof TestTestTestTest Parameters:Parameters:Parameters:Parameters:Twenty three different test parameters thatknown to be most affected by interferenceswere analysed. All of the tests were analysed onRoche Cobas 6000 autoanalyzer (RocheDiagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) with theoriginal reagents (Roche Diagnostics GmbH D-68298 Mannheim, Germany). Analysed testparameters and methods of analyses are shownin table 1. While these parameters were beinganalyzed, serum indices were also examined atthe same time.DescriptionDescriptionDescriptionDescription ofofofof RocheRocheRocheRoche SerumSerumSerumSerum IndeIndeIndeInde xxxxProgramme:Programme:Programme:Programme:Serum indices are calculations of absorbancemeasurements that provide semiquantitativerepresentation of icterus, hemolysis or lipemia(turbidity) levels present in patient samples. Forthis purpose, Roche Serum Index Gen2 (SI2)application program was used. This programworks based on test parameters and gives indexresults for each test parameters. Workingprinciple of Roche serum indices application isas follows: For measuring serum indices, theanalyzer takes an aliquot of the patien sample,dilutes it with 0.9% NaCl and then measuresthe absorbances at three pairs of wavelengths.For measurement of lipemia, wavelengths of700/660 nm are used because this range is freefrom influence by hemolysis and icterus.Hemolysis is measured at 600/570 nm. Icterusis measured at 505/480 nm. To obtain theserum indexes L, H, and I from the sample ’ sabsorbances, the system uses the certainformulas. After serum indices are measured,autoanalyzer compares them with the hemolysis(H), icterus (I) and lipemia (L) limits given ineach individual test application. Once the serumindexes are determined, refer to theapplication ’ s package insert to assess the results.This indicates the index up to which potentialinterference is within the Roche Diagnosticsspecification or when the hemolysed, icteric, orlipemic sample may not be used with therespective application. Potential interferencebelow these limits is considered clinicallyirrelevant. Upper limits for serum indexes canbe defined individually for each test. Limitvalues are loaded with the application. Ifmeasured values are higher than specifiedlimits of the individual tests, the analyzer issuesalarms for the measured results. For example;the application albumin is programmed with aL index limit of 200 and if the obtained L indexis greater than 200, a serum alarm is issued.Therefore a serum data alarm is attached to theresult. If an index value is higher than a
European Journal of Medical Sciences E ur J Med Sci. 2014 Jun ; 1( 2 ): 43 - 5246parametre ’ s limit, an index warning “ > ” is putnext to that parameter. Each report contains anote indicating the appearance of the sample.Serum indices are represented as I.H. forhemolysis, I.L. for lipemia and I.I. for icterus.The hemolysis index, I.H, is reported inhemolysis units that are linear, up to1000mg/dL, and semi-quantitative. For example, ahemolysis index of 500 is equivalent to aknown hemoglobin concentration ofapproximately 500 mg/dL. The lipemia index,I.L, is reported in lipemia units correspondingto mg/dL of Intralipid ® (Kabi-Pharmacia, Inc.),an artificial lipid material. These units arelinear, up to 2000 mg/dL, and semi-quantitative.For example, an L index of 1000 is equivalentto a 1000 mg/dL Intralipid solution. Hence, theL index provides an estimate of sample ’ sturbidity, not its concentration of triglycerides.The icterus index, I.I, is reported in icterus unitsthat are linear, up to 60 mg/dL, and semi-quantitative. For example, an icterus index of20 is equivalent to a known unconjugatedbilirubin concentration of approximately 20mg/dL. List of interferences based on serumindices are shown in table 1. Roche conductsthe interference studies according to guidelinesof The National Committee for ClinicalLaboratory Standarts (NCCLS) (6).RRRR esultsesultsesultsesultsIn present study, while interferences weredetected in 108 of 717 patient samples by usingRoche Serum Index Gen2 (SI2), remaining 609samples did not have any nfluence and werenormal. Hemolysis was detected in 102 samples,lipemia was detected in four samples andicterus was detected in only two samples. Thepercentages of interferences in all samples wereshown in figure 1. Percentage distribution ofhemolysis was 14.22% in total patient samplesand 94.44% in interfered samples. Percentagedistribution of lipemia was 0.55% in totalpatient samples and 3.70% in interferedsamples. Percentage distribution of icterus was0.27% in total patient samples and 1.85% ininterfered samples. The percentages ofinterferences in samples that detectedinterferences were shown in figure 2. Whilesome of the tests that we analysed wereaffected by interference, some tests were not.Tests which were affected by hemolysis werecreatine-kinase MB (CK-MB), lactatedehydrogenase (LDH), aspartat aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (T.BIL), directbilirubin (D.BIL), and unsaturated iron bindingcapacity (UIBC). In the other parameters, theinterference due to hemolysis was not observedbecause, measured values of this parameterswere not higher than specified limits of them.In interfered samples, percentage distributionsof the affected tests by hemolysis interferenceswere shown in figure 3. Hemolysis index (I.H.)values of affected samples by hemolysis werelowest 11 and highest 181 and these valueswere presented in test result reports as warningin test results. When all of the samples affectedby hemolysis were evaluated in terms of I.H.value, number and type of affected testparameters were seen to differentiate dependingon the I.H. value.

In these samples, we observedthat only direct bilirubine was affected bylipemia while there were no effects on the othertests. Values of direct bilirubin affected bylipemia were within normal reference ranges inthe four samples. Lipemia index (I.L.) valueswere lowest 38 and highest 55. Icterinterferences were observed only two samples.In one of the samples, affected test parameterswere cholesterol, CK-MB, creatinine, GGT,total protein and triglyceride, and icter index(I.I.) value was 22.While total protein and creatinine were belownormal reference ranges, the others were abovenormal reference ranges. In the other sample,affected tests were creatinine and triglycerideand I.I. value was 12. Creatinine was belownormal reference ranges while triglyceride waswithin normal reference ranges. Because thenumber of samples in which lipemia and icterinterferences were observed was few,percentage distribution calculations could notbe done.DiscussionDiscussionDiscussionDiscussionKroll and Elin described interference as “ theeffect of a substance present in the samplethat alters the correct value of the result ” (9).Four major endogenous components thatoften affect many laboratory test results arehemoglobin, bilirubin, lipids and paraproteins.In routine laboratory diagnoses, the most
European Journal of Medical Sciences E ur J Med Sci. 2014 Jun ; 1( 2 ): 43 - 5250crucial cause of preanalytical errors ishemolysis. In our study, the most cause ofinterference was found as hemolysis (94.44%).According to data reported by clinicallaboratories, hemolysis is responsible for 40-70% of unsuitable and rejected samples. It isseen five times more than the other causes ofunsuitable samples such as inadequate sample,clotted sample and faulty sample etc. (10,11).Classically, hemolysis is release ofhemoglobin and the other intracellularcomponents to extracellular area followingcell membrane damage. Visible hemolysis isnot recognized until serum or plasma isseparated. When hemoglobin concentrationexceeds 0.3 g/L, hemolysis is recognizedvisually and it gives rise to red colored serumor plasma. Hemolysis can occur in vivo or invitro and it is an undesirable situation,because, it affects accuracy and reliability oflaboratory tests (11,12). Recent studies havereported that hemolysis affects manylaboratory tests such as potassium, sodium,calcium, magnesium, bilirubin, haptoglobin,total protein, ü ric acid, aldolaz, amylase, LDH,AST, ALT, phosphorus, ALP, acidphosphatase, GGT, folate and iron etc. (13-15). In our study, only 6 of 23 studiedparameters were affected from hemolysis.These parameters were CK-MB, LDH, AST,total bilirubin, direct bilirubin and unsaturatediron binding capacity; other parameters weren ’ taffected by hemolysis. Parameters which weremost affected by hemolysis were respectivelyCK-MB, LDH, direct bilirubin, AST,unsaturated iron binding capacity and totalbilirubin. In an article by K ö seo ğ lu et al. İ t wasreported that the most affected parameters fromhemolysis were AST, ALT, bilirubin andpotassium and these parameters were affectedby hemolysis even in very low hemoglobinconcentration (0.5 g/L). Lippi et al. reportedthat they observed clinically significantvariations of AST, LDH, chloride, potassium,sodium values due to hemolysis which was notrecognized visually (0.6 g/L) (16,17). In ourstudy, we observed that the number and type ofaffected test parameters varied according to I.H.value (I.H. value is proportional to thehemoglobin concentration in patient ’ s sera, forexample; if I.H. value is 500, hemoglobinconcentration is 500 mg/dL). According to ourresults, we observed that CK-MB and directbilirubin were affected by hemolysis even inthe lowest I.H. values (I.H. 11-16). AlthoughCK-MB was affected by hemolysis even invery low hemoglobin concentrations, it wasamazing that CK results of samples with thehighest I.H. values (I.H. 181) were not affectedby hemolysis. Adenylate kinase which isreleased to extracellular area from intracellulararea due to erythrocyte membrane damagecauses a rise of CK and CK-MB levels throughanalytical interference. In order to minimizethis interaction, adenylate kinase inhibitorssuch as adenosine monophosphate anddiadenosine pentaphosphate are added intoreactive mixture. For this purpose, Roche firmadds adenosine monophosphate anddiadenosine pentaphosphate to their CK andCK-MB reactives. This implementation causes97% inhibition for adenylate kinase activity andresidual small amount of adenylate kinaseactivity does not affect total CK activity butvery small amount of adenylate kinase activitycan affect to CK-MB measurement. Thisinformation in prospectus of manufacturer wasquite compatible with our results (18). Weobserved that LDH measurements wereaffected by I.H. from 26, AST and UIBCmeasurements were affected by I.H. from 41and total bilirubin measurements were affectedby I.H from 52. In the literature, informationabout the effect of hemolysis on tests is similar;however, there are different assessments aboutthe interference degree of analysis byhemoglobin concentrations. Yi ğ itba şı et al.reported that the effect of interference causedby hemolysis increased parallel to the degree ofhemolysis and added that test results weregradually higher or lower. They reported thatparticularly, AST, ALT, direct bilirubin,sodium and potassium tests were affected evenby very low hemoglobin concentrations. Y ü celat al. reported that acid phosphatase, potassiumand LDH were significantly affected byhemolysis. Ji at al. also evaluated seruminterferences on Roche Cobas 6000 system.Intheir study, the lowest I.H. value was 40 andthe affected parameters were AST, LDH, direct
European Journal of Medical Sciences E ur J Med Sci. 2014 Jun ; 1( 2 ): 43 - 5251bilirubin and UIBC; their results werecompatible with our results (19-21).In our study, the number of samples affectedby lipemia was 4 and the number of samplesaffected by icterus was only 2. Only directbilirubin was affected from lipemia whilecholesterol, CK-MB, creatinine, GGT, totalprotein and triglyceride were affected fromicterus. Whereas total protein and creatininewere negatively affected, the others werepositively affected. The most common causesof lipemia are diet, alcohol intake, DM,hypertriglyceridemia, chronic renal failure,hypothyroidism, pancreatite, multiplemyeloma, primary biliary cirrosis, lupuserithomatasus, estrogen intake. Lipemiainterference occurs due to 3 differentmechanisms: light scattering, increasednonaqueous phase, partition effect betweenpolar and nonpolar phases. Increased bilirubinconcentration causes chemical and spectralinterferences (22, 23).As a result, in order to prevent reporting oferroneous results, each sample should beevaluated against interference probability sothat interference errors could be decreasedand thus quality and patient safety could beimproved. Hinckley et al. reported that visualevaluation was unsuccessful in erroneoussample detection (24). Glick et al. found thatvisual evaluation of hemolysis, lipemia,icterus were very little compatible with realconcentration of interferent (25). Simundic etal. compared visual evaluation withautomated spectrophotometric evaluation.They reported that visual evaluation was notreliable and suggested that automated systemswhich report serum indices should replacevisual evaluation (26).Use of serum indices should be expanded sothat hemolysis and the other interferents aredetected more reliably and faster, possibility oferror is reduced, quality of laboratory diagnosisis increased, economical advantage is providedand patient security is not endangered. Serumindices can be seen as a fast and cheap way tofacilitate and accelerate the laboratoryprocesses for detection of icteric, lipemic andhemolytic samples. Quality of reported resultsis increased by serum indices because 100% ofsamples are controlled. As a result, serumindices will provide a reliable basis fordetection of error due to interferent and thus forrejection of sample (27,28).CCCC onclusiononclusiononclusiononclusionThe samples received by the laboratory may besignificantly influenced by interferences. Thechance of identifying a possible visibleinterferent is greatly decreased when primarytubes are covered with several labels whichprevent the clear inspection of the sample. Aserum index result generated with the sampleresult ensures that all samples are correctlyidentified. Particularly, results of serum indiceson the basis of parameters are much useful formonitoring of degree of interference. Afteranalysis, while test results are obtained, at thesame time, quality of samples is alsoautomatically monitored. The improved clinicalusefulness of the results allows better clinicaldecisions and better patient care.RRRR eferenceseferenceseferenceseferences1. Fraser CG.

  abstract  = { Clinical laboratories frequently encounter samples showing significant haemolysis, icterus or lipaemia. Technical advances, utilizing spectrophotometric measurements on automated chemistry analysers, allow rapid and accurate identification of such samples. However, accurate quantification of haemolysis, icterus and lipaemia interference is of limited value if laboratories do not set rational alert limits, based on sound interference testing experiments. Furthermore, in the context of increasing consolidation of laboratories and the formation of laboratory networks, there is an increasing requirement for harmonization of the handling of haemolysis, icterus and lipaemia-affected samples across different analytical platforms. Harmonization may be best achieved by considering both the analytical aspects of index measurement and the possible variations in the effects of haemolysis, icterus and lipaemia interferences on assays from different manufacturers. Initial verification studies, followed up with ongoing quality control testing, can help a laboratory ensure the accuracy of haemolysis, icterus and lipaemia index results, as well as assist in managing any biases in index results from analysers from different manufacturers. Similarities, and variations, in the effect of haemolysis, icterus and lipaemia interference in assays from different manufacturers can often be predicted from the mechanism of interference. Nevertheless, interference testing is required to confirm expected similarities or to quantify differences. It is important that laboratories are familiar with a number of interference testing protocols and the particular strengths and weaknesses of each. A rigorous approach to all aspects of haemolysis, icterus and lipaemia interference testing allows the analytical progress in index measurement to be translated into improved patient care. },

First, we show that despite empirical psychologists’ nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (≤ .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process. },

A tool for this is the participation in external quality assessment (EQA) for all laboratories performing the HbA1c-test. An additional possibility to detect changes in trueness is to monitor variations in patient cohort mean or median values that is not explained by changes in treatment or selection of patients.Methods:Results reported to an EQA scheme for HbA1c during 20 years have been extracted from Equalis database. The results are compared to current analytical performance specifications (APS) and to the mean HbA1c levels for the Swedish population of persons with type 2 diabetes.Results:The accuracy of the HbA1c test has improved during the period. The hospital lab methods used in Sweden now fulfil APS agreed by professional organizations in Sweden. The accuracy for point-of-care tests (POCT) methods vary over time and fulfil APS for some periods. The bias found for some of the methods might explain changes seen in patient mean values for HbA1c in Sweden during the period 2007-2017.Conclusions:The global standardization of HbA1c has resulted in an improved comparability for HbA1c-results worldwide. But even small variation in trueness for the methods in use might have important impact on mean HbA1c values for cohorts of patients. When a systematic error is observed for a specific method it is therefore essential that manufacturers correct the method without delay. },

  abstract  = {Effective management of clinical laboratories participating in external quality assessment schemes (EQAS) is of fundamental importance in ensuring reliable analytical results. The International Standard ISO 15189:2012 requires participation in interlaboratory comparison [e.g. external quality assessment (EQA)] for all tests provided by an individual laboratory. If EQAS is not commercially available, alternative approaches should be identified, although clinical laboratories may find it challenging to choose the EQAS that comply with the international standards and approved guidelines. Great competence is therefore required, as well as knowledge of the characteristics and key elements affecting the reliability of an EQAS, and the analytical quality specifications stated in approved documents. Another skill of fundamental importance is the ability to identify an alternative approach when the available EQAS are inadequate or missing. Yet the choice of the right EQA program alone does not guarantee its effectiveness. In fact, the fundamental steps of analysis of the information provided in EQA reports and the ability to identify improvement actions to be undertaken call for the involvement of all laboratory staff playing a role in the specific activity. The aim of this paper was to describe the critical aspects that EQA providers and laboratory professionals should control in order to guarantee effective EQAS management and compliance with ISO 15189 accreditation requirements.

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: Recurrent pregnancy loss, (RPL) affecting 1\%{\textendash}2\% of couples, is defined as >=3 consecutive pregnancy losses before 20-week{\textquoteright} gestation. Women with RPL are routinely screened for etiological factors, but routine screening of male partners is not currently recommended. Recently it has been suggested that sperm quality is reduced in male partners of women with RPL, but the reasons underlying this lower quality are unclear. We hypothesized that these men may have underlying impairments of reproductive endocrine and metabolic function that cause reductions in sperm quality.METHODS: After ethical approval, reproductive parameters were compared between healthy controls and male partners of women with RPL. Semen reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured with a validated inhouse chemiluminescent assay. DNA fragmentation was measured with the validated Halosperm method.RESULTS: Total sperm motility, progressive sperm motility, and normal morphology were all reduced in the RPL group vs controls. Mean {\textpm}SE morning serum testosterone (nmol/L) was 15\% lower in RPL than in controls (controls, 19.0 {\textpm} 1.0; RPL, 16.0 {\textpm} 0.8; P \&lt; 0.05). Mean {\textpm}SE serum estradiol (pmol/L) was 16\% lower in RPL than in controls (controls, 103.1 {\textpm} 5.7; RPL, 86.5 {\textpm} 3.4; P \&lt; 0.01). Serum luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone were similar between groups. Mean {\textpm}SE ROS (RLU/sec/106 sperm) were 4-fold higher in RPL than in controls (controls, 2.0 {\textpm} 0.6; RPL, 9.1 {\textpm} 4.1; P \&lt; 0.01). Mean {\textpm}SE sperm DNA fragmentation (\%) was 2-fold higher in RPL than in controls (controls, 7.3 {\textpm} 1.0; RPL, 16.4 {\textpm} 1.5; P \&lt; 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that male partners of women with RPL have impaired reproductive endocrine function, increased levels of semen ROS, and sperm DNA fragmentation. Routine reproductive assessment of the male partners may be beneficial in RPL.},

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of consump-tion of standard eggs and ω-3 enriched eggs on lipoproteins, glucose and inflammation markers. Nineteen healthy volunteers consumed one extra egg per day of either standard eggs or ω-3 enriched eggs in a double-blind, cross-over study. The duration of each period was 1 month. The effects of the different egg diets on apolipoprotein A1 and B (Apo A1 and B), lipoprotein (a), creatinine, cystatin C, C-reactive protein, serum amyloid protein A, interleukin 6, triglycerides, glucose, total-, high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipo-protein cholesterol concentrations were analyzed. Addition of one regular egg per day to the normal diet had no negative impact on blood lipids or inflammation markers. Con-sumption of ω-3 enriched eggs resulted in higher levels of ApoA1, lower ApoB/ApoA1 ratio and lower plasma glucose. These effects have been associated in previous studies with a reduced risk for cardiovascular mortality and diabetes. },

Self-reported diet data were harmonized using a standardized protocol.Dietary cholesterol (mg/day) or egg consumption (number/day).Hazard ratio (HR) and absolute risk difference (ARD) over the entire follow-up for incident CVD (composite of fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, and other CVD deaths) and all-cause mortality, adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral factors.This analysis included 29 615 participants (mean [SD] age, 51.6 [13.5] years at baseline) of whom 13 299 (44.9\\%) were men and 9204 (31.1\\%) were black. During a median follow-up of 17.5 years (interquartile range, 13.0-21.7; maximum, 31.3), there were 5400 incident CVD events and 6132 all-cause deaths. The associations of dietary cholesterol or egg consumption with incident CVD and all-cause mortality were monotonic (all P values for nonlinear terms, .19-.83). Each additional 300 mg of dietary cholesterol consumed per day was significantly associated with higher risk of incident CVD (adjusted HR, 1.17 [95\\% CI, 1.09-1.26]; adjusted ARD, 3.24\\% [95\\% CI, 1.39\\%-5.08\\%]) and all-cause mortality (adjusted HR, 1.18 [95\\% CI, 1.10-1.26]; adjusted ARD, 4.43\\% [95\\% CI, 2.51\\%-6.36\\%]).

  abstract  = {Background: Ingestion of ethylene glycol is a relatively rare event but one with potentially lethal consequences. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are essential. However, diagnosis of poisoning can only be confirmed definitively by the measurement of ethylene glycol and/or its metabolites, usually performed by gas chromatographic methods. These methods are complex, requiring specialized equipment and expertise, and are often not available on an emergency basis. Methods: A quick, simple, and inexpensive enzymatic assay has been developed to detect glycolic acid, the major metabolite of ethylene glycol and the main cause of the resulting metabolic acidosis. In this assay, glycolic acid is converted to glyoxylic acid by glycolate oxidase, with the production of hydrogen peroxide, which is converted to a quinoneimine dye for spectrophotometric detection. Results: The assay has a functional sensitivity of 26 mg/L and coefficients of variation less than 13% (interassay) and less than 10% (intra-assay). No significant interference was observed for a range of compounds, and a comparison with a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method gave clinical sensitivity of 86% and clinical specificity of 92%. Stability of enzyme solutions was increased by the use of an alternative buffer, in which greater than 90% of the original activity was retained after storage at −20°C. Conclusions: As ethylene glycol poisoning is a medical emergency, there is a need for a screening test to minimize delays in diagnosis. The assay we describe is a simple and effective way to detect ethylene glycol poisoning, enabling earlier initiation of appropriate therapy and improving patient outcomes.},

Final diagnoses were centrally adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists with all clinical information including cardiac imaging twice: first, using serial hs-cTnT (Elecsys, primary analysis), and second, using hs-cTnI (Architect, secondary analysis) measurements in addition to the clinically used hs-cTn. hs-cTnI Access was measured at presentation and at 1 h. The primary objective was a direct comparison of diagnostic accuracy as quantified by the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of hs-cTnI Access vs the hs-cTnT Elecsys and hs-cTnI Architect assays. Secondary objectives included the derivation and validation of an hs-cTnI Access-specific 0/1-h algorithm.Results: AMI was the adjudicated final diagnosis in 243 of 1579 (15.4\%) patients. The AUC at presentation for hs-cTnI Access was 0.95 (95\% CI, 0.94{\textendash}0.96), higher than hs-cTnI Architect [0.92 (95\% CI, 0.91{\textendash}0.94; P \&lt; 0.001)] and comparable to hs-cTnT Elecsys [0.94 (95\% CI, 0.93{\textendash}0.95; P = 0.12)]. Applying the derived hs-cTnI Access 0/1-h algorithm (derivation cohort n = 686) to the validation cohort (n = 680), 60\% of patients were ruled out [sensitivity, 98.9\% (95\% CI, 94.3{\textendash}99.8)], and 15\% of patients were ruled in [specificity, 95.9\% (95\% CI, 94.0{\textendash}97.2)]. Patients ruled out by the 0/1-h algorithm had a survival rate of 100\% at 30 days. Findings were confirmed in the secondary analyses by the adjudication including serial measurements of Architect hs-cTnI.Conclusions: Diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of the Beckman hs-cTnI Access assay are very high and at least comparable to Roche hs-cTnT and Abbott hs-cTnI assays.

  abstract  = { Cardiac troponin I and cardiac troponin T are nowadays the criterion biomarkers for the laboratory diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction due to their very high sensitivities and specificities for myocardial injury. However, still many aspects of their degradation, tissue release and elimination from the human circulation are incompletely understood. Myocardial injury may be caused by a variety of different mechanisms, for example, myocardial ischaemia, inflammatory and immunological processes, trauma, drugs and toxins, and myocardial necrosis is preceded by a substantial reversible prelethal phase. Recent experimental data in a pig model of myocardial ischaemia demonstrated cardiac troponin release into the circulation from apoptotic cardiomyocytes as an alternative explanation for clinical situations with increased cardiac troponin without any other evidence for myocardial necrosis. However, the comparably lower sensitivities of all currently available imaging modalities, including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging for the detection of particularly non-focal myocardial necrosis in patients, has to be considered for cardiac troponin test result interpretation in clinical settings without any other evidence for myocardial necrosis apart from increased cardiac troponin concentrations as well. },

This study reviews the available clinical and empirical data. A systematic search of the literature was conducted using the following databases: PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO and Scopus; utilizing different combinations of the following search terms: autism, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Asperger’s disorder (AD), co-morbidity, gender dysphoria (GD), gender identity disorder (GID), transgenderism and transsexualism. In total, 25 articles and reports were selected and discussed. Information was grouped by found co-occurrence rates, underlying hypotheses and implications for diagnosis and treatment. GD and ASD were found to co-occur frequently – sometimes characterized by atypical presentation of GD, which makes a correct diagnosis and determination of treatment options for GD difficult. Despite these challenges there are several case reports describing gender affirming treatment of co-occurring GD in adolescents and adults with ASD. Various underlying hypotheses for the link between GD and ASD were suggested, but almost all of them lack evidence. },

The clinical assessment and treatment of adolescents with this co-occurrence is often complex, related to the developmental aspects of ASD. There are no guidelines for clinical care when ASD and GD co-occur; however, there are clinicians and researchers experienced in this co-occurrence. This study develops initial clinical consensus guidelines for the assessment and care of adolescents with co-occurring ASD and GD, from the best clinical practices of current experts in the field. Expert participants were identified through a comprehensive international search process and invited to participate in a two-stage Delphi procedure to form clinical consensus statements. The Delphi Method is a well-studied research methodology for obtaining consensus among experts to define appropriate clinical care. Of 30 potential experts identified, 22 met criteria as expert in co-occurring ASD and GD youth and participated. Textual data divided into the following data nodes: guidelines for assessment; guidelines for treatment; six primary clinical/psychosocial challenges: social functioning, medical treatments and medical safety, risk of victimization/safety, school, and transition to adulthood issues (i.e., employment and romantic relationships). With a cutoff of 75\% consensus for inclusion, identified experts produced a set of initial guidelines for clinical care. Primary themes include the importance of assessment for GD in ASD, and vice versa, as well as an extended diagnostic period, often with overlap/blurring of treatment and assessment. },

One limitation of UDSs is the potential for false-positive results caused by cross-reactivity with other substances. Amphetamines have an extensive list of cross-reacting medications. The literature contains reports of false-positive amphetamine UDSs with multiple antidepressants and antipsychotics. We present 2 cases of presumed false-positive UDSs for amphetamines after ingestion of aripiprazole. Case 1 was a 16-month-old girl who accidently ingested 15 to 45 mg of aripiprazole. She was lethargic and ataxic at home with 1 episode of vomiting containing no identifiable tablets. She remained sluggish with periods of irritability and was admitted for observation. UDS on 2 consecutive days came back positive for amphetamines. Case 2 was of a 20-month-old girl who was brought into the hospital after accidental ingestion of an unknown quantity of her father{\textquoteright}s medications which included aripiprazole. UDS on the first day of admission came back positive only for amphetamines. Confirmatory testing with gas chromatography{\textendash}mass spectrometry (GC-MS) on the blood and urine samples were also performed for both patients on presentation to detect amphetamines and were subsequently negative. Both patients returned to baseline and were discharged from the hospital. To our knowledge, these cases represent the first reports of false-positive amphetamine urine drug tests with aripiprazole. In both cases, aripiprazole was the drug with the highest likelihood of causing the positive amphetamine screen. The implications of these false-positives include the possibility of unnecessary treatment and monitoring of patients.},

  abstract  = {The use of medicines to treat attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has increased worldwide, including the use of amphetamine-based medicines or prodrugs that metabolise to amphetamine in vivo. At the same time, drugs-of-abuse testing by non-specific, point-of-care immunoassay methods (`quick tests') has increased. This article discusses the risk of `false positive' results or post-analytical misinterpretations of results when immunoassays are used to analyse biological samples from ADHD patients. A rapid evidence review was conducted to identify studies that have focused on the risk of `false positive' test results in immunoassay testing of patients treated with atomoxetine, bupropion, clonidine, guanfacine, methylphenidate, and modafinil. There is only evidence to suggest that bupropion should cause `false positive' immunoassay results. However, there is a lack of systematic, updated evaluations and validations of cross-reactivity patterns for immunoassays in the literature. Advanced laboratory methods can distinguish the use of medicines from illicit amphetamine by stereospecific analysis of dextro- and levoamphetamine; however, these analytical services are not commonly available for routine drug testing. The present situation calls for more awareness, proper education and information on these critical ethical issues in drug testing, both for clinicians, other healthcare professionals involved in drug testing and for patients in medical treatment for ADHD. The pitfalls of immunoassays due to cross-reactivity and insufficient specificity/sensitivity can have serious negative consequences for patients safety with regard to incorrect laboratory drug-testing results. Consequently, confirmatory laboratory analysis should always be performed for `presumptive' positive immunoassay screening results.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: Maintaining consistency of results over time is a challenge in laboratory medicine. Lot-to-lot reagent changes are a major threat to consistency of results. METHODS: For the period October 2007 through July 2012, we reviewed lot validation data for each new lot of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) reagents (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics) at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, and the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA. Analyses of discarded patient samples were used for comparison of lots. For the same period, we determined the distributions of reported patient results for each lot of reagents at the 2 institutions. RESULTS: Lot-to-lot validation studies identified no reagent lot as significantly different from the preceding lot. By contrast, significant lot-to-lot changes were seen in the means and medians of 105 668 reported patient IGF-I results during the period. The frequency of increased results increased nearly 2-fold to a high of 17\%, without detectable changes in the underlying patient demographics. Retrospective statistical analysis indicated that lot-to-lot comparison protocols were underpowered and that validation studies for this assay required testing \&gt;100 samples to achieve 90\% power to detect reagent lots that would significantly alter the distributions of patient results. CONCLUSIONS: The number of test samples required for adequate lot-to-lot validation protocols is high and may be prohibitively large, especially for low-volume or complex assays. Monitoring of the distributions of patient results has the potential to detect lot-to-lot inconsistencies relatively quickly. We recommend that manufacturers implement remote monitoring of patient results from analyzers in multiple institutions to allow rapid identification of between-lot result inconsistency.},

Spurious haemolysis is common at the emergency department (ED) and causes clinically relevant bias to many analyses. Blood gas analysers inability to identify hemolysis can therefore lead to clinical misinterpretations. The objective of this study was to assess the proportion of haemolytic blood gas samples performed at the ED and calculate the predictive values of a novel point-of-care solution for haemolysis detection. Approximately 100 µl of blood from anonymized syringes including venous or arterial blood was, directly after performed blood gas analysis, tested with the POC-Method (Helge H10 s-system, Hemcheck, Karlstad, Sweden) at the ED and result recorded. Thereafter the blood was centrifuged (2000 g) for 10 minutes, 100 µl of plasma put into vials and run in batches of 40 daily on an AU680 analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, California, USA) used as reference method. The threshold for clinically relevant hemolysis was defined as ≥50 mg/dL free haemoglobin. Out of 1270 samples, haemolysis was detected in 7.9\% (n = 100). The POC-method identified haemolytic samples with a sensitivity of 80\%, specificity of 99\%, positive and negative predictive values was 89\% and 98\% respectively. Spurious hemolysis is frequently present in blood gas samples at the ED and should be taken into consideration when assessed in patients. Errors could be detected directly at the point-of-care with a novel technology for hemolysis detection. },

Dates of death were collected from the National Death Register 8 years after baseline. Levels of hemoglobin, red blood cells and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration were lower after 1-year, but higher for mean corpuscular volume and IL-1β, compared to baseline or 6 month follow-up. In the Cox regression model with a time-dependent covariate, raised levels of C-reactive protein and IL-8 were associated with reduced survival time. Elevated levels of C-reactive protein and IL-8 during 1-year follow-up were related to reduce lengths of survival in elderly NHRs. },

  abstract  = { AbstractPoint-of-care testing (POCT) is a key enabling technology for disruptive and transformative innovation in healthcare, allowing tests to be performed quickly and close to the patient. This results in faster clinical decision making and new, more efficient models of care, with clinical, process and economic benefits potentially accruing to all stakeholders. Recognised barriers to the adoption of new technology such as POCT include poor understanding of current practice and thus the unmet need, the challenges of process change, and reluctance to disinvest in redundant resources resulting from improved pathway efficiency. Major contributors to this problem include a background of funding, organisation and management of healthcare that fails to recognise the complexity of a multiple stakeholder health economy seeking to become more outcomes-based and value driven. We examine the concept of a structured value proposition as a generic tool to achieve better adoption of POCT using as an example, the evidence that is available for the rapid measurement of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in the management of diabetes. We highlight the key components of the value proposition, identifying the impact of the test result on all stakeholders and the metrics which are required to define current practice (e.g. a laboratory-based HbA1c testing service), in order to develop the business case and the implementation plan required to demonstrate effective adoption of a POCT-based service. We conclude that the value proposition helps to identify the potential benefits to be gained from using POCT, and the stakeholders to whom they accrue. },

  abstract  = { AbstractExtensive research has been devoted to developing methods for assessing core body temperature, and to determine which method is most accurate. A number of wireless dermal thermometers for home use are presently available, but their relation to core body temperature and suitability for use in clinical research has hitherto not been assessed. The current study aimed to evaluate such thermometers by comparing them to the results of a rectal thermometer. Four wireless dermal thermometers for home use (FeverSmart, iThermonitor, Quest Temp Sitter, and Thermochron iButton) were applied to 15 patients during 24 h, and rectal temperature was measured at four occasions. Pearson correlation revealed moderate correlation for the Feversmart (r = 0.75), iThermonitor (r = 0.79), and Thermochron iButton (r = 0.71) systems. The Quest Temp Sitter system malfunctioned repeatedly, and the correlation (r = 0.29) for this method should therefore be assessed with caution. All dermal thermometers rendered lower average temperatures than Terumo c405 (Feversmart −0.70 ± 0.65 °C; iThermonitor −0.77 ± 0.53 °C, Quest Temp Sitter −1.18 ± 0.66 °C, and Thermochron iButton −0.87 ± 0.65 °C). Sensitivity of the dermal thermometers for detecting core temperatures ≥38.0 °C was low, ranging from 0.33 to 0.6, but improved to 0.60 to 0.80 after adjusting temperatures by the methods’ average deviation from rectal temperature. The results from the dermal thermometers tested here showed an insufficient correlation to core temperature to be used for core temperature monitoring in clinical research and practice. Unfortunately, other options for non-invasive temperature measurements are few. The two thermometers with the least unsatisfactory performance profile in our evaluations were the Feversmart and iThermonitor systems. },

  abstract  = { AbstractLow-risk thresholds for alcohol use differ across various national guidelines. To assess the novel WHO risk drinking levels in light of alcohol-sensitive common laboratory tests, we analysed biomarkers of liver status, inflammation and lipid profiles from a population-based survey of individuals classified to abstainers and different WHO risk drinking levels defined in terms of mean alcohol consumption per day. The study included 22,327 participants aged 25–74 years from the National FINRISK Study. Data on alcohol use, health status, diet, body weight and lifestyle (smoking, coffee consumption and physical activity) were recorded from structured interviews. Alcohol data from self-reports covering the past 12 months were used to categorize the participants into subgroups of abstainers and WHO risk drinking categories representing low, moderate, high and very high risk drinkers. Serum liver enzymes (GGT, ALT), C-reactive protein (CRP) and lipid profiles were measured using standard laboratory techniques. Alcohol risk category was roughly linearly related with the occurrence of elevated values for GGT, ALT and CRP. Alcohol drinking also significantly influenced the incidence of abnormalities in serum lipids. Significantly higher odds for abnormal GGT, ALT and altered lipid profiles remained in alcohol drinkers even after adjustment for age, waist circumference, physical inactivity, smoking and coffee consumption. A more systematic use of laboratory tests during treatment of individuals classified to WHO risk drinking categories may improve the assessment of alcohol-related health risks. Follow-ups of biomarker responses may also prove to be useful in health interventions aimed at reducing alcohol consumption. },

We have validated a fully automated turbidimetric method and present health-related reference limits. Calprotectin was measured by Siemens Advia XPT with the Bühlmann fCAL® turbo test (Bühlmann Laboratories AG, Schönenbuch, Switzerland), a particle enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay for quantification of calprotectin in fecal extracts. Plasma and serum samples were analysed directly, while whole blood was first extracted with M-PER® Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (ThermoFisher) and diluted with B-CAL-EX (Bühlmann). We studied analytical imprecision, estimated health-related reference limits and examined the correlation between neutrophil-calprotectin (blood-calprotectin adjusted for plasma-calprotectin) and the neutrophil count. The intermediate (‘day-to-day’) coefficient of variation was 3.5 and 1.0\% for heparin-plasma-calprotectin at 0.52 mg/L and 3.53 mg/L, respectively, and 4.9\% for heparin-blood-calprotectin at 50.2 mg/L. Health-related reference limits were 0.470–3.02 mg/L for calprotectin in heparin-plasma, 50.8–182 mg/L for calprotectin in heparin-blood, 0.534–2.41\% for the ratio between them and 24.7–33.3 pg for the mean amount of calprotectin per neutrophil. Compared to heparin-plasma, calprotectin concentrations were significantly lower in EDTA-plasma and higher in serum (p < .05). Correlation between neutrophil-calprotectin and the neutrophil count was excellent. We have shown that the Bühlmann fCAL® turbo test can be used to measure calprotectin in plasma and blood. },

Since its introduction as a diabetes monitoring tool, and its more recent application as a diagnostic tool, the number of measurements of HbA1c have risen dramatically. However, HbA1c change is slow, so repeating measurements should not be done too often. We use a large, unfiltered dataset from 52,017 patients to determine the possible rate of change in HbA1c concentration. In our laboratory, the critical difference between HbA1c measurements is 8.5\%. Our data show that a 1-unit HbA1c rise takes 4 weeks to occur, hence, at a HbA1c concentration around 50 mmol/mol Hgb, a critically increased HbA1c concentration cannot be determined until after 16 weeks. Conversely a critically lower HbA1c can manifest itself after 2 weeks, but after 7 weeks the dropping tendency stops. The amount of measurements that can be cancelled because they were taken sooner than 16 weeks is 23 percent. },

We examined cause-specific mortality and morbidity associated with NSAIDs in a nationwide cohort of MI patients.   Methods and Results By individual-level linkage of nationwide registries of hospitalization and drug dispensing from pharmacies in Denmark, patients aged >30 years admitted with first-time MI during 1997–2009 and their subsequent NSAID use were identified. The risk of three cardiovascular specific endpoints: cardiovascular death, the composite of coronary death and nonfatal MI, and the composite of fatal and nonfatal stroke, associated with NSAID use was analyzed by Cox proportional hazard analyses. Of 97,698 patients included 44.0% received NSAIDs during follow-up. Overall use of NSAIDs was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death (hazard ratio [HR] 1.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.36–1.49). In particular use of the nonselective NSAID diclofenac and the selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor rofecoxib was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular death (HR 1.96 [1.79–2.15] and HR1.66 [1.44–1.91], respectively) with a dose dependent increase in risk. Use of ibuprofen was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular death (HR 1.34[1.26–1.44]), whereas naproxen was associated with the lowest risk of (e.g., HR 1.27[1.01–1.59].   Conclusion Use of individual NSAIDs is associated with different cause-specific cardiovascular risk and in particular rofecoxib and diclofenac were associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. These results support caution with use of all NSAIDs in patients with prior MI.},

A European Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine Task and Finish Group has addressed this issue. The aim of this report is to (a) describe the Biological Variation Data Critical Appraisal Checklist (BIVAC), which verifies whether publications have included all essential elements that may impact the veracity of associated BV estimates, (b) use the BIVAC to critically appraise existing BV publications on enzymes, lipids, kidney, and diabetes-related measurands, and (c) apply metaanalysis to deliver a global within-subject BV (CVI) estimate for alanine aminotransferase (ALT).METHODS: In the BIVAC, publications were rated as A, B, C, or D, indicating descending compliance for 14 BIVAC quality items, focusing on study design, methodology, and statistical handling. A D grade indicated that associated BV estimates should not be applied in clinical practice. Systematic searches were applied to identify BV studies for 28 different measurands.RESULTS: In total, 128 publications were identified, providing 935 different BV estimates. Nine percent achieved D scores. Outlier analysis and variance homogeneity testing were scored as C in \&gt;60\% of 847 cases. Metaanalysis delivered a CVI estimate for ALT of 15.4\%.CONCLUSIONS: Application of BIVAC to BV publications identified deficiencies in required study detail and delivery, especially for statistical analysis. Those deficiencies impact the veracity of BV estimates. BV data from BIVAC-compliant studies can be combined to deliver robust global estimates for safe clinical application.},

While other mammals have thickly myelinated afferents signaling pain (ultrafast nociceptors), these have not been demonstrated in humans. Here, we performed single-unit axonal recordings (microneurography) from cutaneous mechanoreceptive afferents in healthy participants. We identified A-fiber high-threshold mechanoreceptors (A-HTMRs) that were insensitive to gentle touch, encoded noxious skin indentations, and displayed conduction velocities similar to A-fiber low-threshold mechanoreceptors. Intraneural electrical stimulation of single ultrafast A-HTMRs evoked painful percepts. Testing in patients with selective deafferentation revealed impaired pain judgments to graded mechanical stimuli only when thickly myelinated fibers were absent. This function was preserved in patients with a loss-of-function mutation in mechanotransduction channel PIEZO2. These findings demonstrate that human mechanical pain does not require PIEZO2 and can be signaled by fast-conducting, thickly myelinated afferents.},

  abstract = {This space-time study of bacteriological response compared the presence of pathogens with indicators contained in surface and groundwater in mountainous regions. A systematic search for bacteria such as Listeria, Salmonella, Campylobacter and Yersinia carried out simultaneously with a search for indicators has shown that these waters can occasionally contain potentially pathogens, though these are generally to be found in small quantities. The most common pathogens found are Campylobacter and Listeria. Salmonella has never been isolated. The presence of pathogens is usually accompanied by the presence of classic indicators of contamination such as Escherichia coli, enterococci and other aerobic bacteria. Exceptions are only to be observed in cases of samples presenting very low numbers of pathogens. Such low pathogen levels have a minimal impact on human health; but we cannot exclude that, during periods affected by specific conditions, higher levels might temporarily occur. Our research has demonstrated that classic indicators can be considered as efficient detectors of pathogens in most cases. When these indicators are used systematically and regularly, the human health hazard can be qualified as low but not negligible. The presence of pathogens, together with their survival capacity, brings the protection measures currently applied to safeguard drinking waters sharply into question.},

similar to previously reported SSU rRNA gene sequences from the Arctic Ocean, suggesting the importance of
local aerial transport processes for marine microbiota. More than 47% of the cyanobacterial OTUs in the snow

derived from local sources. Viable cyanobacteria isolated from the snow indicated free exchange between the

Bacterial communities in alpine snow on a Mont Blanc glacier, associated with four depositions of Saharan dust during the period 2006–2009, were studied using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and flow cytometry. Also, sand from the Tunisian Sahara, Saharan dust collected in Grenoble and Mont Blanc snow containing no Saharan dust (one sample of each) were analyzed. The bacterial community composition varied significantly in snow containing four dust depositions over a 3-year period. Out of 61 phylotypes recovered from dusty snow, only three phylotypes were detected in more than one sample. Overall, 15 phylotypes were recognized as potential snow colonizers. For snow samples, these phylotypes belonged to Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria, while for Saharan sand/dust samples they belonged to Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Deinococcus-Thermus and Proteobacteria. Thus, regardless of the time-scale, Saharan dust events can bring different microbiota with no common species set to alpine glaciers. This seems to be defined more by event peculiarities and aeolian transport conditions than by the bacterial load from the original dust source.},

Here we combine data from the Anorexia Nervosa Genetics Initiative (ANGI)8,9 and the Eating Disorders Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC-ED) and conduct a genome-wide association study of 16,992 cases of anorexia nervosa and 55,525 controls, identifying eight significant loci. The genetic architecture of anorexia nervosa mirrors its clinical presentation, showing significant genetic correlations with psychiatric disorders, physical activity, and metabolic (including glycemic), lipid and anthropometric traits, independent of the effects of common variants associated with body-mass index. These results further encourage a reconceptualization of anorexia nervosa as a metabo-psychiatric disorder. Elucidating the metabolic component is a critical direction for future research, and paying attention to both psychiatric and metabolic components may be key to improving outcomes.},

The extent of this problem is unknown. Our study aimed to quantify the between-subject variation of the systematic PT-INR difference between CoaguChek and a hospital laboratory method. We used register data with PT-INR results from both CoaguChek and a hospital laboratory method (STA-SPA+) in samples taken simultaneously from 108 patients. After excluding five patients with outlying results, we used mixed-effects models to estimate individual slopes and intercepts to describe the systematic relationship between the two methods for each patient, and calculated the fraction of patients having a systematic difference greater than 0.3 INR units. The included 103 patients had from 3 to 16, median seven data pairs measured over a time span from 15 to 2319, median 234 days. The mean of individual slopes was 1.113, with a standard deviation of 0.137. Corresponding values for the intercept were –0.151 and 0.208, respectively. Adjusted for the average systematic difference, the proportion of patients with a systematic difference greater than 0.3 INR units increased from 15\% at a PT-INR level of 2.5 to 50\% at a PT-INR level of 4. The systematic difference between CoaguChek and STA-SPA + varies considerably between patients. This precludes using a single, common formula to make the CoaguChek results directly comparable to the results from the hospital laboratory. },

The information retrieved and evaluated from a comparison is often limited to a scatter plot, a regression analysis and a differential plot. However, many more features and performance criteria are available from the same data. Access to a comprehensive set of information can also be used to harmonize results by recalibration and estimate any risk in applying alternate methods or surrogates to reference methods. Common principles for comparison of results are explained. Well known and new relations between commonly used methods and their limitations are discussed. A new application of the empirical folded density functions is introduced, and the use of a simplified error grid in the evaluation of a comparison is explored. Parametric and nonparametric pairwise significance tests and a convenient option of partitioning and limiting the dataset, ordinary linear and Deming regression functions, including uncertainties of the constants are provided in an Excel spreadsheet that is submitted as a downloadable supplemental file. The information harboured in a split sample comparison of methods is explored in detail. Procedures cover the main content of CLSI recommendations EP9, EP21 and EP27. Several additional practical procedures are described in a submitted single spreadsheet program.

  abstract  = {Much of what we know about the evolution of altruism comes from animals. Here, we show that studying a microbe has yielded unique insights, particularly in understanding how social cheaters are controlled. The social stage of Dictylostelium discoideum occurs when the amoebae run out of their bacterial prey and aggregate into a multicellular, motile slug. This slug forms a fruiting body in which about a fifth of cells die to form a stalk that supports the remaining cells as they form hardy dispersal-ready spores. Because this social stage forms from aggregation, it is analogous to a social group, or a chimeric multicellular organism, and is vulnerable to internal conflict. Advances in cell labeling, microscopy, single-gene knockouts, and genomics, as well as the results of decades of study of D. discoideum as a model for development, allow us to explore the genetic basis of social contests and control of cheaters in unprecedented detail. Cheaters are limited from exploiting other clones by high relatedness, kin discrimination, pleiotropy, noble resistance, and lottery-like role assignment. The active nature of these limits is reflected in the elevated rates of change in social genes compared with nonsocial genes. Despite control of cheaters, some conflict is still expressed in chimeras, with slower movement of slugs, slightly decreased investment in stalk compared with spore cells, and differential contributions to stalk and spores.

  abstract = { Little is known about respiratory muscle function in acute undernutrition, although an inadequate caloric intake is common in numerous disease states. Twelve young-adult, healthy female volunteers performed two familiarization experiments and were then studied after 7 days of consuming 40\% of normal daily caloric intake as well as after 1 wk of normal caloric intake. In each experiment subjects performed tests of resting pulmonary function, inspiratory muscle strength, and ventilatory endurance, the last of which involved two 60-s and two 6-min isocapnic maximum voluntary ventilation maneuvers. Subjects then walked to exhaustion in 8–20 min on a treadmill. The caloric restriction did not affect performance of any breathing test but did lower endurance time in severe treadmill exercise (P less than 0.05). Basal metabolic rate was lowered, resting blood levels of free fatty acids and beta-hydroxybutyrate elevated, and glucose lowered following the caloric restriction (P less than 0.05). Blood lactate levels were lower during and after exercise following caloric restriction (P less than 0.05). We conclude that ventilatory muscle strength and endurance are fully preserved in caloric restriction severe enough to cause mild ketoacidosis and hypoglycemia, lowered basal metabolic rate, and decreased endurance in severe treadmill exercise. },

The purpose of this study was to test the hypotheses that 21 days of CR in lean subjects would 1) result in significant losses of lean mass despite a suppression in leucine turnover and oxidation and 2) negatively impact exercise performance. Nine young, normal-weight men [23 ± 5 y, 78.6 ± 5.7 kg, peak oxygen consumption (V̇o2 peak) 45.2 ± 7.3 ml·kg−1·min−1, mean ± SD] were underfed by 40\% of the calories required to maintain body weight for 21 days and lost 3.8 ± 0.3 kg body wt and 2.0 ± 0.4 kg lean mass. Protein intake was kept at 1.2 g·kg−1·day−1. Leucine kinetics were measured using α-ketoisocaproic acid reciprocal pool model in the postabsorptive state during rest and 50 min of exercise (EX) at 50\% of V̇o2 peak. Body composition, basal metabolic rate (BMR), and exercise performance were measured throughout the intervention. At rest, leucine flux (≈131 μmol·kg−1·h−1) and oxidation (Rox; ≈19 μmol·kg−1·h−1) did not differ pre- and post-CR. During EX, leucine flux (129 ± 6 vs. 121 ± 6) and Rox (54 ± 6 vs. 46 ± 8) were lower after CR than they were pre-CR. Nitrogen balance was negative throughout the intervention (≈3.0g N/day), and BMR declined from 1,898 ± 262 to 1,670 ± 203 kcal/day. Aerobic performance (V̇o2 peak, endurance cycling) was not impacted by CR, but arm flexion endurance decreased by 20\%. In conclusion, 3 wk of caloric restriction reduced leucine flux and Rox during exercise in normal-weight young men. However, despite negative nitrogen balance and loss of lean mass, whole body exercise performance was well maintained in response to CR. },

(BMR) developed by Schofield (Schofield database), Henry (Oxford database) and
Cole (Oxford database) using mean values for age, weight, height and BMR of
published studies.
Design: Literature review of studies published from 1985 to March 2002.
Setting: All studies selected used appropriate methods and followed conditions that
met the criteria established for basal metabolism, were performed in healthy adults,
and were not part of the Schofield or Oxford database.
Subjects: A total of 261 groups of men and women from 175 studies were selected and
categorised in three age groups (18.5–29.9, 30.0–59.9, $60 years old) and three body
mass index (BMI) groups (normal weight, overweight and obese).
Results: Linear regression and concordance correlation analysis showed that the three
sets of equations had the same association and agreement with measured BMR, across
gender, age, and BMI groups. The agreement of all equations was moderate for men
and poor for women. The lowest mean squared prediction errors (MSPRs) were given
by Henry equations in men and Cole equations in women. Henry and Cole equations
gave lower values than Schofield equations, except for men over 60 years of age.
Henry equations were the most accurate in men. None of the three equations
performed consistently better in women.
Conclusion: These results support the use of Henry equations in men with a wide
range of age and BMI. None of the proposed predictive equations seem to be
appropriate to estimate BMR in women},

Later studies on humans have also found a detrimental effect of fasting on exercise endurance, with the exception of 1 study which found no difference. The discrepancy between humans and rats could not be explained by level of glycogen sparing, mode of exercise, duration of the fast, physiological differences or level of training. The intensity of exercise, and a potential placebo effect of fasting, are possible reasons for the conflicting results. Despite reduced endurance performance, fasted humans are able to exercise and maintain blood glucose homeostasis; the specific cause of an earlier onset of fatigue during a single bout of exercise in the fasted state remains unclear.},

Each subject completed two exercise tests at the same treadmill speed (set at 70\% maximal O2 uptake), one following a 27-h fast and one 3 h after a preexercise meal, in random order. Fasting caused a 44.7 +/- 5.8\% (SE) decrease in endurance performance (P less than 0.01). Blood, muscle, psychological, and ventilatory data were examined to determine the cause of the decreased performance. Fasting caused significant increases in O2 uptake (9.3 +/- 2.0\%), heart rate (8.4 +/- 2.4\%), and rating of perceived exertion, ventilation, and psychological fatigue, evident within the first 60 min of exercise. There were no differences in plasma glucose or epinephrine levels. Muscle glycogen degraded at the same rate (0.482 +/- 0.146 vs. 0.470 +/- 0.281 mumol.g-1.min-1 in the nonfasted and fasted tests, respectively) despite lower respiratory exchange ratio and elevated free fatty acid levels, which may partially explain the elevated O2 uptake. Lactate, insulin, and norepinephrine were all increased in the fasted test (P less than 0.05). The increase in norepinephrine (r = 0.79, P less than 0.01), the diameter of type I muscle fibers (r = 0.70, P less than 0.05), and ending insulin levels (r = -0.88, P less than 0.01) were correlated with endurance time in the fasted state. Fatigue in endurance running for 27-h fasted humans appears to be related to a combination of physiological, psychological, metabolic, and hormonal changes. },

Fasting produced significant elevations in the resting concentrations of blood free fatty acids (FFA; 1.16 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.56 +/- 0.06 mM, F vs. PA, respectively, a 107\% increase), beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OH, 2.06 +/- 0.66 vs. 0.15 +/- 0.06 mM, a 1,270\% increase), and glycerol (0.12 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.04 +/- 0.01 mM, a 200\% increase), with a significant decline in glucose (79.79 +/- 2.12 vs. 98.88 +/- 3.11 mg/dl, a 19\% decrease). Exercise in the F trial increased FFA, decreased glucose, and significantly elevated beta-OH and glycerol over the PA trial. There was no difference in blood glucose concentration between trials at exhaustion. However, F produced a significant decrement in exercise endurance time compared with the PA trial (88.9 +/- 18.3 vs. 144.4 +/- 22.6 min, F vs. PA, a 38\% decrease). Based on the respiratory exchange ratio, fasting led to a greater utilization of lipids during rest and exercise. It was concluded that 1) a 36-h fast significantly altered substrate utilization at rest and throughout exercise to exhaustion, 2) glucose levels do not appear to be the single determinant of time to exhaustion in submaximal exercise, and 3) despite the apparent sparing of carbohydrate utilization with the 36-h fast, endurance performance was significantly decreased. },

The major physiological adaptations that allow breath-hold divers to achieve such depths and duration are called the ``diving response'' that is comprised of peripheral vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure, bradycardia, decreased cardiac output, increased cerebral and myocardial blood flow, splenic contraction, and preserved O2 delivery to the brain and heart. This complex of physiological adaptations is not unique to humans, but can be found in all diving mammals. Despite these profound physiological adaptations, divers may frequently show hypoxic loss of consciousness. The breath-hold starts with an easy-going phase in which respiratory muscles are inactive, whereas during the second so-called ``struggle'' phase, involuntary breathing movements start. These contractions increase cerebral blood flow by facilitating left stroke volume, cardiac output, and arterial pressure. The analysis of the compensatory mechanisms involved in maximal breath-holds can improve brain survival during conditions involving profound brain hypoperfusion and deoxygenation.},

Data were analyzed from September 23, 2016 through February 4, 2018.Across 5 countries, models were fitted to estimate variance components describing the total variance in risk for ASD occurrence owing to additive genetics, maternal, and shared and nonshared environmental effects.The analytic sample included 2 001 631 individuals, of whom 1 027 546 (51.3%) were male. Among the entire sample, 22 156 were diagnosed with ASD. The median (95% CI) ASD heritability was 80.8% (73.2%-85.5%) for country-specific point estimates, ranging from 50.9% (25.1%-75.6%) (Finland) to 86.8% (69.8%-100.0%) (Israel). For the Nordic countries combined, heritability estimates ranged from 81.2% (73.9%-85.3%) to 82.7% (79.1%-86.0%). Maternal effect was estimated to range from 0.4% to 1.6%. Estimates of genetic, maternal, and environmental effects for autistic disorder were similar with ASD.Based on population data from 5 countries, the heritability of ASD was estimated to be approximately 80%, indicating that the variation in ASD occurrence in the population is mostly owing to inherited genetic influences, with no support for contribution from maternal effects. The results suggest possible modest differences in the sources of ASD risk between countries.},

We evaluated the analytical performance of HI on two different platforms. Further, the impact of implementing analytically and clinically derived sample rejection criteria was investigated. Precision profiles were established, and analytical error was assessed by comparison with the reference method for hemoglobin measurement on Architect c8000/c16000 (Abbott) and Cobas c702 (Roche Diagnostics) instruments. The impact of a more analyte-specific cut off based on analytical and biologival variation was examined for five hemolysis-sensitive plasma analyses according to European recommendations. Lastly, a reference interval was established for the HI on Cobas, using the CLSI C28A3c nonparametric method. Imprecision for HI of 0.6-3.0 \% for Architect and 1.5-4.5 \% for Cobas was considered acceptable, which also applied for trueness in the measuring tange > 2 g/L. If cutoffs based on analytical and biological variation were used to manage results from hemolyzed samples, more potassium, LDH, conjugated bilirubin and phosphate results would be suppressed. Considering RCV only LDS remained sensitive to hemolysis. The Cobas-based HI reference interval was established to 0.01–0.16 g/L. Thorough verification of the HI on two different clinical chemistry analyzers reveals acceptable analytical performance. HI cutoffs suggested by manufacturers may be optimized by clinical laboratories using analytical and/or biological variation. A reference interval for the HI analysis is relevant as the analysis has been suggested as a diagnostic tool in the assessment of in vivo hemolysis. },

As the likelihood of falling victim to a cyberattack has increased over time, so too has the need to understand exactly what is effective corporate communication after an attack, and how best to engage the concerns of customers, partners and other stakeholders. This research seeks to tackle this problem through a critical, multi-faceted investigation into the efficacy of crisis communication and public relations following a data breach. It does so by drawing on academic literature, obtained through a systematic literature review, and real-world case studies. Qualitative data analysis is used to interpret and structure the results, allowing for the development of a new, comprehensive framework for corporate communication to support companies in their preparation and response to such events. The validity of this framework is demonstrated by its evaluation through interviews with senior industry professionals, as well as a critical assessment against relevant practice and research. The framework is further refined based on these evaluations, and an updated version defined. This research represents the first grounded, comprehensive and evaluated proposal for characterising effective corporate communication after cyber security incidents.},

However, when the variances of the measurement errors of the two methods differ, limits of agreement can be misleading. biasplot implements a new statistical methodology that Taffé (Forthcoming, Statistical Methods in Medical Research) recently developed to circumvent this issue and assess bias and precision of the two measurement methods (one is the reference standard, and the other is the new measurement method to be evaluated). biasplot produces three new plots introduced by Taffé: the “bias plot”, “precision plot”, and “comparison plot”. These help the investigator visually evaluate the performance of the new measurement method. In this article, we introduce the user-written command biasplot and present worked examples using simulated data included with the package. Note that the Taffé method assumes there are several measurements from the reference standard and possibly as few as one measurement from the new method for each individual. },

  abstract  = { AbstractThe aim of this study was to establish creatinine growth curves separately for males and females that can be used to adjust childhood levels of serum creatinine to corresponding adult levels. Linear regression with fractional polynomials of age as independent variable was used to construct creatinine growth curves for a reference cohort (n = 83,157 samples from Belgium and Sweden, age 2–40 years). Adjusted creatinine obtained from the growth curves was used to improve accuracy of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) based on the Lund–Malmö revised (LMR) equation in children. The LMR equation based on creatinine values adjusted to age 18 years was validated against measured GFR (mGFR) in a separate cohort of 4005 children from four different European countries. Validation metrics included median bias, precision, and accuracy expressed as percentage of estimates within ±30\% (P30) of mGFR. Remarkable improvements in bias and accuracy were observed; P30 increased from 56\% to 74\% after creatinine adjustments in children with mGFR <75 mL/min/1.73 m2 (n = 932), while P30 was relatively unchanged (89–90\%) at mGFR ≥75 mL/min/1.73 m2 (n = 3073). The suggested approach with adjusted creatinine makes LMR applicable in children irrespective of their renal function. },

A total of 147 895 singleton children delivered vaginally between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2015, in a single integrated health care system were included. Children were followed up from the age of 1 year until the first date of the following occurrences: clinical diagnosis of ASD, last date of health plan enrollment, death, or the study end date of December 31, 2018.Use and duration of LEA.The main outcome was clinical diagnosis of ASD. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of ASD associated with LEA exposure.Among the cohort of 147 895 singleton children (74 425 boys [50.3\\%]; mean [SD] gestational age at delivery, 38.9 [1.5] weeks), 109 719 (74.2\\%) were exposed to maternal LEA. Fever during labor was observed in 13 055 mothers (11.9\\%) in the LEA group and 510 of 38 176 mothers (1.3\\%) in the non-LEA group. Autism spectrum disorders were diagnosed in 2039 children (1.9\\%) in the LEA group and 485 children (1.3\\%) in the non-LEA group. After adjusting for potential confounders, including birth year, medical center, maternal age at delivery, parity, race/ethnicity, educational level, household income, history of comorbidity, diabetes during pregnancy, smoking during pregnancy, preeclampsia or eclampsia, prepregnancy body mass index, gestational weight gain, gestational age at delivery, and birth weight, the HR associated with LEA vs non-LEA exposure was 1.37 (95\\% CI, 1.23-1.53). Relative to the unexposed group, the adjusted HR associated with LEA exposure of less than 4 hours was 1.33 (95\\% CI, 1.17-1.53), with LEA exposure of 4 to 8 hours was 1.35 (95\\% CI, 1.20-1.53), and with LEA exposure of more than 8 hours was 1.46 (95\\% CI, 1.27-1.69). Within the LEA group, there was a significant trend of ASD risk associated with increasing duration of LEA exposure after adjusting for covariates (HR for linear trend, 1.05 [95\\% CI, 1.01-1.09] per 4 hours). Adding fever to the model did not change the HR estimate associated with LEA exposure (adjusted HR for LEA vs non-LEA, 1.37 [95\\% CI, 1.22-1.53]).This study suggests that maternal LEA may be associated with increased ASD risk in children. The risk appears to not be directly associated with epidural-related maternal fever.}},

  abstract = {Background
Many different equations have been previously described to estimate plasma osmolality. The aim of this study is to compare 14 of these equations, in order to determine which results agree best with measured osmolality.
Objectives
Our aim is to elucidate which is the most accurate equation for osmolality calculation among the fourteen that were previously described.
Methods
We measured osmolality by the freezing point depression method, and glucose, urea, sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium concentrations with Unicell DXC 800 analyzer. Goodness-of-fit rates were calculated using the Passing–Bablok regression model and the t-paired sample test. In addition, we used survival curves in order to find the percentage of cases in which the difference between measured and calculated osmolality was under 10mOsm/kg. Data were plotted using the Bland–Altman graphical approach.
Results
The equation that provides the best fit between measured and calculated osmolality is 1.86(Na+K)+1.15(Glu/18)+(Urea/6)+14, followed by 2Na+1.15(Glu/18)+(Urea/6).
Conclusions
According to our results, the Dorwart–Chalmer's equation should not be used for osmolality calculations. The equation 1.86(Na+K)+1.15(Glu/18)+(Urea/6)+14 is the most accurate. The widespread use of the equation 2(Na+K)+(Glu/18)+(Urea/6) is also acceptable.},

The rise of the current digital culture coincides with longstanding scientific questions about why humans sometimes remember and sometimes forget, and why some individuals remember better than others2-6. Here we examine whether spontaneous attention lapses--in the moment7-12, across individuals13-15 and as a function of everyday media multitasking16-19--negatively correlate with remembering. Electroencephalography and pupillometry measures of attention20,21 were recorded as eighty young adults (mean age, 21.7 years) performed a goal-directed episodic encoding and retrieval task22. Trait-level sustained attention was further quantified using task-based23 and questionnaire measures24,25. Using trial-to-trial retrieval data, we show that tonic lapses in attention in the moment before remembering, assayed by posterior alpha power and pupil diameter, were correlated with reductions in neural signals of goal coding and memory, along with behavioural forgetting. Independent measures of trait-level attention lapsing mediated the relationship between neural assays of lapsing and memory performance, and between media multitasking and memory. Attention lapses partially account for why we remember or forget in the moment, and why some individuals remember better than others. Heavier media multitasking is associated with a propensity to have attention lapses and forget.},

The correct statistical approach to assess this degree of agreement is not obvious. Correlation and regression studies are frequently proposed. However, correlation studies the relationship between one variable and another, not the differences, and it is not recommended as a method for assessing the comparability between methods.  In 1983 Altman and Bland (B&A) proposed an alternative analysis, based on the quantification of the agreement between two quantitative measurements by studying the mean difference and constructing limits of agreement.  The B&A plot analysis is a simple way to evaluate a bias between the mean differences, and to estimate an agreement interval, within which 95% of the differences of the second method, compared to the first one, fall. Data can be analyzed both as unit differences plot and as percentage differences plot.  The B&A plot method only defines the intervals of agreements, it does not say whether those limits are acceptable or not. Acceptable limits must be defined a priori, based on clinical necessity, biological considerations or other goals.  The aim of this article is to provide guidance on the use and interpretation of Bland Altman analysis in method comparison studies.},

  abstract  = {The analysis of clinical samples, population samples, and controlled trials is typically subjected to rigorous statistical review. This fact is understandable, given that the results of clinical investigation will often be used to inform patient care or clinical decision making. One would not want to predicate patient advice on research findings that are not correctly interpreted or valid. For this reason, most major journals publishing clinical research include statistical reviews as a standard component of manuscript evaluation for publication. Clinical data, regardless of publication venue, are often subject to rather uniform principles of review.
In contrast, basic science studies are often handled less uniformly, perhaps because of the unique challenges inherent in this type of investigation. A single basic science manuscript, for example, can span several scientific disciplines and involve biochemistry, cell culture, model animal systems, and even selected clinical samples. Such a manuscript structure is a challenge for analysis and statistical review. Not all journals publishing basic science articles use statistical consultation, although it is becoming increasingly common.1 In addition, most statistical reviewers are more comfortable with clinical study design than with basic science research. Consequently, there are multiple reasons why the statistical analysis of basic science research might be suboptimal. In this review, we focused on common sources of confusion and errors in the analysis and interpretation of basic science studies. The issues addressed are seen repeatedly in the authors' editorial experience, and we hope this article will serve as a guide for those who may submit their basic science studies to journals that publish both clinical and basic science research. We have discussed issues related to sample size and power, study design, data analysis, and presentation of results (more details are provided by Katz2 and Rosner3). We then illustrated these issues using a set of examples from basic science research studies.},

Recently, several new tickborne viruses have emerged in the United States, including Bourbon virus, Heartland virus, Powassan virus, and the severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus transmitted by a tick recently introduced from China, the Asian long-horned tick (Haemaphysalis longicornis). In most cases, there are no specific drug therapies for tickborne viral infections, and treatment is supportive. Vaccination, personal protection, landscape management, and wildlife management are all effective strategies for the primary prevention and control of tickborne viral infectious diseases.
Ticks are versatile vectors of infectious diseases and transmit a broad range of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Ticks harbor pathogens without infection and share pathogens with other ticks while feeding together on a host. The primary objective of this review is to identify tickborne viral pathogens in the United States, focusing on emerging pathogens.

Menopausal hormone therapy and health outcomes during the intervention and extended post-stopping phases of the Women’s Health Initiative randomized trials. JAMA 2013;310:1353-68.†The history of menopausal hormone therapy (HT) research has been an epic saga over the past half century. To understand the JAMA article featured here, it must be placed in the context of the evolving HT research at the time. Long recognized as the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms in early menopause, a larger role for systemic HT in the prevention of osteoporosis, coronary heart disease (CHD), dementia, and other chronic diseases of aging began to emerge by the 1980s and 1990s, based predominantly on observational research (1–3). In numerous observational studies, women using estrogen or estrogen-progestogen therapy experienced lower rates of CHD and other chronic diseases than nonusers. Estrogen therapy became one of the widely prescribed medications in the world. Also, due to presumed cardioprotection, HT came to be perceived as potentially of greatest benefit to women at highest risk of CHD. In 1992, the American College of Physicians recommended that HT be considered for CHD risk reduction in high-risk women, based on the premise that these women would have the most to gain from such treatment (4).}},

This  study  compares  the  performance  of  the  Modification  of  Diet  in  Renal  Disease  (MDRD)  study  and  Chronic  Kidney  Disease  Epidemiology  Collaboration  (CKD-EPI)  equations  with  the  revised  Lund-Malmö  equa-tion  (LM  Revised),  a  new  equation  that  can  be  expected  to  handle  changes  in  GFR  across  the  life  span  more  accurately.

Methods:  The  study  included  3495  examinations  in  2847  adult   Swedish   patients   referred   for   measurement   of   GFR  (mGFR)  2008–2010  by  plasma  clearance  of  iohexol  (median 52 mL/min/1.73 m2). Bias, precision [interquartile range (IQR)] and accuracy [percentage of estimates  ± 10% (P10) and  ± 30% (P30) of mGFR] were compared.Results:   The   overall   results   of   LM   Revised/MDRD/CKD-EPI  were:  median  bias  2%/8%/11%,  IQR  12/14/14  mL/min/1.73 m2, P10 40%/35%/35% and P30 84%/75%/76%. LM  Revised  was  the  most  stable  equation  in  terms  of  bias,  precision  and  accuracy  across  mGFR,  age  and  BMI  intervals   irrespective   of   gender.   MDRD   and   CKD-EPI   overestimated  mGFR  in  patients  with  decreased  kidney  function,  young  adults  and  elderly.  All  three  equations  overestimated  mGFR  and  had  low  accuracy  in  patients  with BMI  < 20 kg/m2, most pronounced among men.

Conclusions: In settings similar to the investigated cohort LM  Revised  should  be  preferred  to  MDRD  and  CKD-EPI  due  to  its  higher  accuracy  and  more  stable  performance  across GFR, age and BMI intervals.

inherited trait. Although some people find PROP to be extremely
bitter, others cannot distinguish PROP solutions from plain water.
In a series of studies, greater PROP sensitivity was linked with
lower acceptability of other bitter compounds and with lower reported liking for some bitter foods. Women, identified as “supertasters” of PROP, had lower acceptance scores for grapefruit
juice, green tea, Brussels sprouts, and some soy products. Many of
these foods contain bitter phytochemicals with reputed cancerprotective activity. These include flavonoids in citrus fruit, polyphenols in green tea and red wine, glucosinolates in cruciferous vegetables, and isoflavones in soy products. Consumer acceptance of
these plant-based foods may depend critically on inherited taste
factors. This review examines the role of genetic taste markers in
determining taste preferences and food choices.},

The aim of this critical-incident interview study was to identify organizational and social-psychological conditions and processes that Swedish physicians and nurses (n=36) perceived as important for patient and/or staff safety, and participative safety behavior. Injury due to psychological overload was the most salient type of healthcare worker hazard. Patient and healthcare worker safety went hand in hand. Good patient safety was present when caregivers had good access to their psychological and social capacities. These functions were jeopardized by stress. Our results indicated that quantitative overload, excessive cognitive and emotional complexity, lack of social support and good teamwork, organizational instability, and distrust for and frustration with the way healthcare organizations were managed, caused stress related function impairment in staff, which lead to mistakes and near misses. These aspects also in themselves contributed to risks. Good safety was associated with adequate resources and routines, workplace learning, and supportive unit level managers and colleagues. Features of professional cultures related to ethical norms to offer best possible care for the patient, in spite of insufficient resources, contributed to acceptance of working conditions that could lead to stress and overload.},

By establishing sex-specific creatinine growth curves for children and young adults, creatinine levels of children and young adults below age 40 years were adjusted with 40 as assigned age and applied in the CKD-EPI equation. Validation was performed in 4005 children (2–17 years) and 3309 young adults (18–39 years) using metrics based on bias, precision, and accuracy including percentage of estimates within 30% (P30) of measured GFR (mGFR). Comparisons were made with the CKiD and Schwartz-Lyon equations in children. CKD-EPI with age-adjusted creatinine instead of actual age and creatinine led to extensive improvements in bias, precision, and accuracy at all ages, in both sexes and at all levels of mGFR. At mGFR below and above 75 mL/min/1.73m2, the P30 increased from 12% to 75% and 33% to 88% in children, respectively, and from 56% to 73% and 83% to 92% in young adults, respectively. In children adjusted CKD-EPI was more accurate than CKiD, especially above mGFR 75 mL/min/1.73m2 (P30 88% vs. 82%), while Schwartz-Lyon was more accurate than adjusted CKD-EPI at mGFR below 75 mL/min/1.73m2 (P30 81% vs. 75%). Thus, the proposed strategy based on age-adjusted creatinine in children and young adults makes the CKD-EPI equation applicable across the full spectrum of age and kidney function.},
